Keynote Address, Open to the Public
Saturday, March 25, 2017, 4:00 - 5:00 pm, Grand Ballroom

Technology meets Neuroscience – A Vision of the Future
of Brain Fitness
A fundamental challenge of modern society is the development of effective approaches to
enhance brain function and cognition in both the healthy and impaired. For the healthy, this
should be a core mission of our educational system and for the cognitively impaired this is the
primary goal of our medical system. Unfortunately, neither of these systems have effectively
met this challenge. I will describe a novel approach out of our lab that uses custom-designed
video games to achieve meaningful and sustainable cognitive enhancement via personalized
closed-loop systems (Nature 2013; Neuron 4014). I will also share with you the next stage of
our research program, which integrates our video games with the latest technological
innovations in software (e.g., brain computer interface algorithms, GPU computing, cloud-based
analytics) and hardware (e.g., virtual reality, mobile EEG, motion capture, physiological
recording devices (watches), transcranial brain stimulation) to further enhance our brain’s information processing systems with the ultimate aim of
improving quality of life.

George A Miller Prize
Congratulations to David C. Van Essen
for being awarded this honor!
David C. Van Essen will accept this prestigious award and deliver
his lecture on Sunday, March 26, 2017, 4:00 – 5:00 pm, in the Grand
Ballroom.

A Cortical Cartographer’s View of Brain
Structure, Function, Connectivity,
Development, and Evolution
David C. Van Essen
Alumni Endowed Professor, Department of Neuroscience,
Washington University in St. Louis
The cerebral cortex is the
dominant structure of the
mammalian brain, and it plays
critical but diverse roles in
cognition, perception, emotion,
and motor control. This lecture
will review recent progress in
elucidating the structure,
function,
connectivity,
development, and evolution of
cerebral cortex in humans and
nonhuman
primates.
Underlying
methodological
themes will include the power of surface-based analysis and visualization
and the importance of user-friendly data sharing for accelerating progress
in exploring these topics. Consideration of cortical development will
include questions of why the cortex is a sheet whose convolutions vary
across species and across individuals. Advances in elucidating functional
organization include a recent multimodal human cortical parcellation,
based on data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), that reveals
180 distinct areas in each hemisphere. The ability to accurately parcellate
the cortex in individual subjects will enable systematic analyses of
individual variability in relation to many neurobiologically informative
features as well as hundreds of behavioral measures that are part of the
freely shared HCP data. Comparisons with nonhuman primates, including
chimpanzees as well as macaque monkeys, provide intriguing
evolutionary insights regarding the dramatic expansion of neocortical
regions associated with higher cognition in the human lineage.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society

About the George A. Miller Prize in Cognitive
Neuroscience
The George A. Miller Prize in Cognitive Neuroscience was established in
1995 by the Cognitive Neuroscience Society to honor the innovative
scholarship of George A. Miller, whose many theoretical advances have
greatly influenced the discipline of cognitive neuroscience. The first ten
years of the prize were funded by generous support from the James S.
McDonnell Foundation.
Each year the Prize shall recognize an individual whose distinguished
research is at the cutting-edge of their discipline with realized or future
potential, to revolutionize cognitive neuroscience. Extraordinary
innovation and high impact on international scientific thinking should be a
hallmark of the recipient’s work.
An annual call for nominations for the George A. Miller Prize will be made
to the membership of the society. The recipient of the prize will attend the
annual meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society and deliver the
George A. Miller lecture.

The Fred Kavli Distinguished
Career Contributions Award
Congratulations to Marcia K. Johnson
for being awarded this honor!
Marcia K. Johnson will accept this prestigious award and deliver
her lecture on Monday, March 27, 2017, 1:30 – 2:30 pm, in the Grand
Ballroom.

Understanding the Subjective Experience of
Remembering
Marcia K. Johnson
Yale University
Memories are attributions that
we make about mental
experiences based on their
subjective qualities, our prior
knowledge and beliefs, our
motives and goals, and the
social context. Cognitive
behavioral studies using both
objective
and
subjective
measures provide
much
information
about
the
encoding,
revival
and
monitoring processes that yield
both true and false memories. Neuroimaging and patient studies further
enrich our understanding of the relation between memory and reality. This
talk will highlight some key theoretical ideas, empirical findings, and
challenging persisting questions about the subjective experience of
remembering.

About the Distinguished Career
Contributions Award

Young Investigator Award
Congratulations to the 2017 Young
Investigator Award Winners
Leah Somerville, Ph.D., Harvard University
Nicholas Turk-Brown, Ph.D., Princeton University
YIA special lectures take place on Monday, March 27, 2017, 4:30 – 5:30 pm, in
the Grand Ballroom A at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco.
The purpose of the awards is to recognize outstanding contributions by scientists
early in their careers. Two awardees, one male and one female, are named by
the Awards Committee, and are honored at the CNS annual meeting. Each award
includes $500 US to be used by the winners toward travel costs to the meeting,
or for any other purpose.

Neurodevelopmental mechanisms
underlying normative shifts in goal-directed
behavior
Monday, March 27, 2017, 4:30 –5:00 pm, Grand Ballroom A

Leah Somerville, Ph.D
Harvard University
My lab’s research aims to
reveal how neurodevelopmentally-mediated shifts in
circuit-level brain function
contribute to changes in
motivated, emotional, and
social
behavior
during
adolescence. My talk will
feature new work that reveals
how the adolescent brain is
uniquely “tuned” to particular
suites of motivated cues, which
impacts adolescents’ inhibitory
control and social decision
making. Ultimately, the aims of this work are threefold: to bolster
fundamental understanding of human neurodevelopment in the second
decade of life, to inform relationships between circuit-level brain function
and human behavioral outcomes more generally, and to gain insight into
mechanisms of health risks that emerge during adolescence.

Statistical learning as a new take on
memory systems
Monday, March 27, 2017, 5:00 –5:30 pm, Grand Ballroom A

Nicholas Turk-Brown, Ph.D.
Princeton University
Memory is often divided into
distinct types, based on
whether conscious or not,
episodic or semantic, sensory
or motor, etc. These useful
distinctions
have
been
supported
by
abundant
behavioral
and
neural
dissociations.
A
natural
consequence has been the
intuitive impression of a one-toone mapping between brain
systems and memory types.
Aside
from
theoretical
concerns about this, there have also now been several empirical
demonstrations of where these boundaries break down. As one example,
I will briefly describe a series of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and
computational studies that implicate the hippocampus in statistical
learning, a function more traditionally ascribed to cortex. These studies
highlight my lab's integrative approach to cognitive neuroscience,
embracing the distributed and interactive nature of cognitive processes
and their implementation in the brain.

Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience
Big Ideas in Cognitive
Neuroscience
Saturday, March 25, 2017, 2:00 - 4:00pm, Bayview Room
Co-sponsored by the Cognitive Neuroscience Institute (CNI) and the
Max-Planck-Society
Organizers: David Poeppel (Max-Planck-Institute & NYU) and Mike
Gazzaniga (UC Santa Barbara)
Chairs: Anna C. Nobre (Oxford University) and Marc Raichle
(Washington University St. Louis)

There has been remarkable progress in the last years in the
neurosciences, often driven by compelling technical developments in
recording techniques, innovative analytic approaches, and new
computational frameworks. But what are the big ideas that go along
with the big techniques and the big data? In this symposium, we
discuss some foundational themes and critical challenges that deal
with the neurosciences more broadly, but especially the human
neurosciences. Recent discussions in the neurosciences have been
relentlessly reductionist. The guiding principle of this symposium is
that there is no privileged level of analysis that can yield special
explanatory insight into the mind/brain on its own, so ideas and
techniques across levels will be necessary. There are many domains
of inquiry that merit examination and debate, but to initiate a first CNS
discussion, just three themes will be addressed in this symposium:
memory, language, and motor control/action. Six speakers, in three
pairs, will consider some major challenges and cutting-edge
advances, from molecular mechanisms to decoding approaches to
network computations. The presentations and debate aim to provide a
tentative outline of what might be a productive and ambitious agenda
for our fields.

Memory
Speakers: Charles R. Gallistel, Rutgers University and Tomás Ryan,
Trinity College Dublin & MIT

Language
Speakers: Angela Friederici, Max-Planck-Institute and Jean-Rémi
King, NYU.

Action/Motor
Speakers: John Krakauer, Johns Hopkins University and Danielle
Bassett, University of Pennsylvania.

FRONTAL CORTEX CONTRIBUTIONS TO DECISION
MAKING
Sunday, March 26, 10:00 am - Noon, Ballroom A
Chair: Elisabeth A (Betsy) Murray, National Institute of Mental
Health
Speakers: Betsy Murray, Erin Rich, Paul Cisek, Joseph Kable
There is broad interest in the neural mechanisms underlying rewardbased decision making. The four speakers will provide an update on
different aspects of decision making in macaques and humans. Murray
and Rich will unravel the neural substrates and neural mechanisms
underlying object choices in macaque monkeys. Murray will discuss
the causal contributions of different frontal cortex areas to object
choices, focusing on the complementary roles for orbital and ventral
prefrontal regions. Rich will discuss a novel approach to decode value
representations from orbitofrontal cortex during individual choices with
high temporal resolution. Cisek will present the novel hypothesis that
decisions about actions unfold as a biased competition, and then will
test that idea using neurophysiological approaches in macaques.
Based on findings from both functional imaging and effects of brain
damage, Kable will discuss the separable contributions of
ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex to decision
making in humans.
TALK 1: FROM KNOWLEDGE TO ACTION: THE ROLE OF THE
PRIMATE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX
Betsy Murray1; 1National Institute of Mental Health
The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), traditionally defined as Walker’s areas
11, 13 and 14, has long been thought to play a critical role in behavioral
flexibility, including behavioral inhibition and the regulation of emotion.
Recent evidence has overturned these ideas by showing that
inadvertent damage to fiber pathways account for the reported deficits.
The use of a more selective lesion method in macaque monkeys has
shown that OFC has a more specific and different function:
representing and updating the value of specific expected outcomes,
based on current biological states. These updated valuations, in turn,
guide choice behavior. Recent studies have identified functional
subdivisions within OFC and helped to differentiate it from nearby
20

areas. In one study we found that the posterior part of OFC, area 13,
is necessary for its value updating function, while the anterior part,
area 11, translates this knowledge into adaptive actions. In a second
study we contrasted the contributions of OFC and the neighboring
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC; Walker’s area 12) to value
updating. We found that OFC and VLPFC play complementary roles
in value updating and—by extension—decision making. The former
depends on dynamic internal states; the latter depends on dynamic
external contingencies. Given that granular OFC and VLPFC emerged
during the evolution of primates, a comparative analysis suggests that
these capacities built on OFC functions inherited from early mammals.
TALK 2: DYNAMIC ENCODING OF CHOICE IN THE
ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX
Erin Rich1,2; 1University of California Berkeley, 2University of
California San Francisco
When making a subjective decision, it is believed that the brain
computes a value for each option and compares these values to arrive
at a choice. Evidence suggests that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is
critically involved in this process, however the neural mechanisms
involved remain largely obscure. One reason is that preferences are
frequently driven by knowledge and states internal to the organism,
and far removed from externally observable sensory inputs or motor
outputs. Furthermore, subjective decisions are not stereotyped. They
may evolve differently even if the same decision is made multiple
times, so that averaging neural responses over repeated trials can
obscure critical detail. With this in mind, we used a novel approach to
decode value representations from OFC during individual choices with
high temporal resolution. Ensembles of OFC neurons and field
potentials were recorded while non-human primate subjects chose
between images that predicted rewards of different value. We used a
classification algorithm to decode patterns of activity associated with
each image, and found that OFC alternated between states
representing the value of two choice options. The decoded patterns
varied trial-by-trial, but the strength and frequency of the recovered
states predicted whether a subject would decide quickly or vacillate
between the two alternatives. Multiple neural features contributed to
these representations, and individual neurons were found to shift their
firing rates as the network evaluated each option. Overall, dynamic

2017 Annual M eeting

representations of value in OFC are likely a fundamental feature of
large-scale brain networks that underlie value-based decision-making.
TALK 3: NEURAL MECHANISMS OF REAL-TIME EMBODIED
DECISIONS
Paul Cisek1; 1University of Montreal
Psychological and neurophysiological studies of decision-making have
focused primarily on scenarios in which subjects are faced with
discrete options that are stable in time, permitting a serial process of
representing the relevant information, careful deliberation about the
choice, followed by action planning and execution. However, the brain
evolved to guide interactions with a dynamic and constantly changing
world, in which the choices themselves as well as their relative costs
and benefits are defined by the momentary geometry of the immediate
environment and are continuously changing during ongoing activity.
Such “embodied decisions” still dominate our lives, whether we’re
playing a sport or walking through a crowd, and they pose challenges
that are very different than the demands of economic choice. To deal
with these challenges, animals require a neural architecture in which
the sensorimotor specification of potential actions, their valuation,
selection, and even execution can all take place in parallel. I will
describe a general hypothesis for how the brain deals with the
challenges of such dynamic and embodied behavior, and present a
series of neurophysiological recording experiments in rhesus monkeys
aimed at testing the predictions of this hypothesis. These experiments
suggest that decisions about actions unfold as a biased competition
taking place within a map of potential actions and that the resolution
of this competition, in the sensorimotor system, is what determines the
volitional commitment to an action choice.
TALK 4: VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX PLAYS A
SIMILAR ROLE IN TEMPORALLY-EXTENDED FORAGING-STYLE
DECISIONS AND BINARY CHOICES
Joseph Kable1; 1University of Pennsylvania
Many decisions involve choosing whether to continue pursuing a
current goal or abandon this course of action in favor of an alternative
one. Foraging is a classic example of such sequential, temporallyextended decision making. There has been much debate about
whether the neural mechanisms of temporally-extended decisions,
such as foraging, are fundamentally similar to those of choices from a
fixed menu of options. To address this question, we performed a series
of studies using a willingness-to-wait paradigm, in which people
continually reassess whether they want to keep waiting for a
temporally uncertain delayed reward. We find that waiting behavior in
this task is well described by formal models of optimal foraging. Using
fMRI, we find that neural activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
tracks the value of the awaited reward as it dynamically changes
through time, akin to the static value signal previously observed in this
region during discrete choices from a fixed menu. Damage to the

I nvit ed Sym pos ium

ventromedial prefrontal cortex in humans also impairs the calibration
of waiting, in the same way that damage to this region impairs the
consistency of binary choices. In contrast to the results in ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, we find that anterior cingulate cortex and anterior
insula exhibit increased activity right before decisions to abandon the
current option, and interpretation of this as a signal to shift strategy is
bolstered by the finding that lesions here enhance waiting. These
results argue for a continuity in the role of frontal cortex across different
forms of decision-making.

Invited Symposium Session 2
CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS IN HEARING, SPEECH, AND
LANGUAGE
Sunday, March 26, 10:00 am - Noon, Ballroom B/C
Chair: David Poeppel, Max-Planck-Institute, NYU
Speakers: Saskia Haegens, Virginie van Wassenhove, Nai Ding,
David Poeppel
Neural activity of an oscillatory nature is observed in a range of studies
investigating perception and cognition. There is legitimate debate
about the role of oscillations, but on balance there is emerging
consensus that cortical oscillations play a critical role in shaping the
temporal structure of perceptual experience. One area of research in
which new theories and approaches are being explored concerns their
potential causal role for hearing speech, and language processing.
From selecting information in auditory streams to recognizing the
elements of speech to constructing abstract linguistic representations,
oscillations across timescales (from low-frequency delta to activity in
the high-gamma band) have been implicated in functionally specific
ways. The symposium addresses major new phenomena and their
potential explanations by drawing on psychophysics and
neurophysiology (MEG, ECoG, EEG). Linking hypotheses are
developed between basic computational properties underlying
hearing, speech, and language and how rhythmic brain activity might
form the implementational basis underlying these operations.
TALK 1: OSCILLATORY DYNAMICS OF AUDITORY ATTENTION
Saskia Haegens1; 1Columbia University
In daily life our brains receive a continuous stream of sensory input.
Effective processing in a complex natural environment requires
attention: selection of relevant input and suppression of irrelevant
information. Here I will talk about the oscillatory dynamics thought to
be instrumental in directing attention, specifically, (1) the alpha rhythm,
and (2) neuronal entrainment to slow frequency rhythms. The alpha
rhythm has been proposed as a mechanism of functional inhibition. In
a series of spatial attention studies we showed that decreased alpha
facilitates processing whereas increased alpha functions to suppress

I nv ited Sym posium

distracting input. I will here discuss the evidence for this mechanism in
the auditory system. In addition, I will present a series of
psychophysics experiments on auditory temporal attention, showing
rhythmic entrainment as a mechanism of focusing attention on relevant
input. Subjects performed an auditory discrimination task, in which
they received a temporal visual cue, which was either informative
(rhythmic condition) or not informative about the specific timing of the
target (random condition). We showed that when a target is presented
in-phase with the cued rhythm, performance improves as compared to
both the random-mode (no precise temporal information) and the outof-phase (unexpected) condition. In an accompanying MEG study we
looked into the neural correlate of this effect, and found increased delta
coherence, in the rhythmic condition, which was sustained after the
cue, confirming the entrainment prediction.
TALK 2: TIMING SPEECH CONTENT
Virginie van Wassenhove1; 1CEA/NeuroSpin, France
Neuronal oscillations have been implicated in various cognitive
functions including time and speech processing. Non-stationarities in
the phase and in the power of entrained brain responses are not only
critical to index the endogenous control of information processing but
also to capture an individual’s subjective perception of time or speech
content. For instance, using a temporal recalibration paradigm in which
participants adapted to audiovisual asynchronies while being recorded
with magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed that changes in the
phase of the auditory entrained responses could predict an individual’s
conscious event timing. In the speech domain, neuronal oscillations
have been hypothesized to segment the acoustic stream into
computational units (e.g. syllables or words). To test whether parsing
was driven by bottom-up acoustic cues or modulated by top-down
representational availability, participants listened to speech streams
that would yield two possible percepts. Two markers of neural-speech
tracking were found under endogenous control: small modulations in
low-frequency oscillations and variable latencies of high-frequency
neural activity (sp. beta and gamma bands). While changes in lowfrequency neural oscillations were compatible with the encoding of
pre-lexical segmentation cues, high-frequency activity informed on an
individual’s conscious speech percept. Altogether, these results are
consistent with the notion of neural oscillations as cortical framing of
information processing in time.
TALK 3: CORTICAL TRACKING OF HIERARCHICAL LINGUISTIC
STRUCTURES IN CONNECTED SPEECH
Nai Ding1; 1Zhejiang University, China
Language is hierarchically organized into syllables, words, phrases,
and sentences. For spoken language, online building of these
hierarchical linguistic structures is a fundamental yet challenging task.
Although the boundaries between syllables generally have clear
acoustic signatures, determining the boundaries between words and

22

C ognitiv e N eurosc ience Society

2017 Annual M eet ing

phrases critically relies on the listener's linguistic knowledge. During
speech listening, it has been well characterized that auditory cortical
activity is entrained to the syllabic rhythm of speech. However, how
larger linguistic structures, such as words and phrases, are
represented in the brain remains elusive and is investigated in this
study. We designed speech materials in which the hierarchical
linguistic structure of speech is dissociated from low level acoustic
features,
and
measured
cortical
activity
using
magnetoencephalography (MEG) from listeners listening to such
materials. It is demonstrated that cortical activity is concurrently
entrained to the rhythms of syllables, phrases, and sentences,
unconfounded by the tracking of acoustic properties of speech.
Furthermore, entrainment to larger linguistic structures such as
phrases and sentences is demonstrated to be associated with the
syntactic structure of speech rather than the predictability of each
incoming word. In summary, cortical circuits can generate slow
rhythms matching the time scales of larger linguistic structures, even
when such rhythms are not present in the speech input, which provides
a plausible mechanism for online building of large linguistic structures.
TALK 4: CORTICAL RHYTHMS IN HEARING, SPEECH, AND
LANGUAGE: A TAXONOMY
David Poeppel1,2; 1Max-Planck-Institute, 2NYU
Oscillations have been observed in a wide range of phenomena in
cognition, in general, and language processing, in particular. The
rumors about oscillations range from ‘they are causally crucial’ to ‘they
are at most the exhaust fumes of cortical computation.’ Can the
wilderness of oscillation-based phenomena be tamed? On the view
that brain rhythms are not merely epiphenomenal but play some role,
an attempt at a taxonomic model is made. I argue that oscillations
across rates can be argued to sample, predict, and attend to the world.
Most broadly speaking, the pairing of theta and gamma underlies
sampling, the pairing of delta and beta underlies predicting, and alpha
splits the low and high rhythm regimes and underlies attending and
inhibiting the inputs that confront our perceptual and cognitive
systems.

Invited Symposium

reasoning and problem solving. However, recent advances in
behavioral and neuroscientific methods have revealed that an
individual’s attentional state is not stable, but instead fluctuates
substantially over time. During any given task setting, an individual’s
attentional state can range from being completely task-focused (e.g.,
in the zone) to completely disengaged (e.g., mind-wandering). This
symposium will showcase recent work revealing how fluctuations in
the brain’s ongoing attentional state impact cognitive functioning and
task performance. Edward Vogel will describe how fluctuations of
attentional control may determine individual differences in working
memory capacity. Mariam Aly will discuss her work examining how
variance in attentional state determines the quality of episodic memory
representations that are encoded in the hippocampus. Michael
Esterman will talk about his work characterizing the brain networks
related to attentional fluctuations and how they connect to changes in
ongoing task performance. Finally, Kalina Christoff will discuss her
work on the neural bases of mind-wandering in which she argues that
mind-wandering plays a critical role in allowing for spontaneous
thought.
TALK 1: ATTENTIONAL LAPSES DRIVE INDIVIDUAL
DIFFERENCES IN WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY
Kirsten C. S. Adam1, Edward K. Vogel1; 1University of Chicago
Working memory (WM) is restricted and varies considerably across
individuals. These individual differences in WM are strongly predictive
of many high level functions such as reasoning and intelligence. In
previous work, we and others have found that low capacity individuals
are poorer at exerting attentional control than high capacity individuals.
However, the aggregate nature of most attention and memory
measures leaves a basic question untested. Do low capacity
individuals have a consistently reduced attentional capacity or is their
poorer performance a mixture of "normal" capacity trials with trials in
which they were completely disengaged from the task? Using both
behavioral and EEG approaches we examined trial by trial fluctuations
in WM success. While we found that low capacity individuals had
roughly double the frequency of complete attentional lapses, this factor
alone was insufficient to account for the extent of the differences
between subjects. Instead, our results suggest that these individual
differences are primarily driven by periodic fluctuations in the
successful implementation of attentional control over working memory
storage. We argue that these fluctuations in attentional control may
reveal a common thread linking WM to performance on other cognitive
and scholastic aptitude measures.
TALK 2: HIPPOCAMPAL REPRESENTATIONS OF ATTENTIONAL
STATE PREDICT THE FORMATION OF EPISODIC MEMORY
Mariam Aly1, Nicholas B. Turk-Browne1; 1Princeton University
Attention modulates what we see and what we remember. Despite this
connection in behavior, little is known about the mechanisms that link

attention to memory formation in the brain. Using high-resolution fMRI,
we investigated the hypothesis that attentional states are represented
in the hippocampus, and that the quality of these representations
during encoding influences whether attended information is later
remembered. In Phase 1 of the experiment, participants performed an
attention task in which, on every trial, they viewed an image of a room
with a painting and then searched through a stream of images for a
painting from the same artist (art state) or a room with the same layout
(room state). All trials of each attentional state were used to identify an
average pattern of activity within each hippocampal subfield that
corresponded to the representation of that state. Phase 2 used an
incidental encoding design with trial-unique images (rooms with art);
participants attended to the art or to the rooms in different blocks.
Memory for the attended aspect of each image (art or room) was
tested in Phase 3. We predicted that participants would be more likely
to remember attended information if, during encoding, their
hippocampus was more strongly in an attentional state that prioritized
that information. Indeed, trial-by-trial encoding activity patterns in
hippocampal subfields CA2/3/DG were more highly correlated with the
task-relevant attentional state representation when items were
subsequently remembered vs. forgotten. These results offer insight
into the mechanisms by which attention transforms percepts into
memories.
TALK 3: CLARIFYING THE ROLES OF TASK-POSITIVE AND
TASK-NEGATIVE NETWORKS IN ATTENTIONAL
FLUCTUATIONS

7Massachusetts General Hospital
Sustaining attention is challenging and in reality our attention
fluctuates. Though these fluctuations have been linked to spontaneous
activity in the brain’s default mode network (DMN) as well as taskpositive attention networks (TPNs), several inconsistencies exist
regarding the nature of these relationships. In the DMN, activity has
been associated with self-reported mind-wandering, and such mindwandering is often associated with error-prone, variable behavior.
However, increased DMN activity has also been reliably associated
with stable, rather than variable behavior (i.e., being ‘in the zone’). To
address this seeming contradiction, subjects performed a sustained
attention task during fMRI, simultaneously measuring self-reported
mind-wandering, task variability, and brain activity. We found that even
though mind-wandering co-occurred with increased task variability,
highest DMN signal levels were observed during mind-wandering and
stable behavior simultaneously. In a second experiment, we
addressed a parallel contradiction in TPNs, namely that TPN activity
is associated with motivated attention, which is typically itself

23

I nv ited -Sympos ium

Session

associated with accurate, stable behavior. However, increased TPN
activity has also been reliably associated with variable, rather than
stable behavior (i.e., being ‘out of the zone’). Using a similar
continuous performance task and performance-based rewards, we
find that while motivation co-occurred with decreased variability,
highest TPN activity was observed with motivation and variable
behavior simultaneously. Our results challenge commonly accepted
viewpoints that spontaneous DMN/TPN activity primarily reflects mindwandering and motivated attention, respectively, by showing that it
also reflects attentional state fluctuations that cannot be captured by
self-report or extrinsic experimental manipulations.
TALK 4: MIND WANDERING AS SPONTANEOUS THOUGHT: A
DYNAMIC FRAMEWORK
Kalina Christoff1; 1University of British Columbia
Mind-wandering has recently come to occupy a central position in
cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Most theories and research
so far have examined it in terms task-unrelated or stimulusindependent mental contents that occur at particular moments of time.
A defining feature of mind-wandering, however, are its dynamics: how
thought moves over time. In this talk, I will introduce a dynamic
framework for understanding mind-wandering and its neural basis. I
propose that mind-wandering is best understood as a member of a
larger family of spontaneous thought processes – a family that also
includes creative thought and dreaming. I will distinguish between two
types of constraints on thought – deliberate and automatic – that can
reduce thought’s spontaneous movement. Within this framework,
fluctuations between spontaneous, automatic, and deliberate modes
of thinking correspond to changing interactions among large-scale
brain networks. Finally, the framework situates spontaneous thought
within a broader conceptual space that allows its comparison to goaldirected thought, as well as to clinical disorders that make thought
excessively constrained – such as in rumination and anxiety, or
excessively variable – such as in ADHD.

Adolescence is increasingly being recognized as a unique and
significant stage of development supporting the establishment of

24

2017 Annual M eeting

cognitive control and its integration with emotional and social
processing systems. Emerging evidence indicates that this transition
is underlied by unique processes of network specialization specific to
supporting the transition to established adult modes of brain
organization. This symposium will discuss work characterizing
changes in functional brain organization during the pubertal period that
support specialization of cognitive and affective processes. Bea Luna
will present fMRI and MEG data on developmental changes in the
instantiation of cognitive brain states and cognitive network stability.
Her results will show stabilization of task related systems with
increased complexity in resting state connectivity. Damien Fair will
present data examining the influence of emotional context on intrinsic
brain connectivity across the adolescent, young adult, and adult
periods. He will show how a specific phenotype (i.e. brain patterns that
revert to a “younger” age in emotional contexts) relates to risk
perception and risk preference. Jason Chein will follow describing
research exploring how the structural and functional maturation of
brain networks engaged in social information processing, reward
valuation, and cognitive control impact adolescent decision making
and reward learning, and affect adolescents' relative susceptibility to
the context in which decision and reward processing occurs. Finally,
Juliet Davidow will present studies on the consequences of heightened
adolescent reward reactivity on motivated learning and episodic
memory as striatal and hippocampal systems are differentially
engaged affecting cognitive control.
TALK 1: CHANGES IN THE INTEGRATION OF BRAIN
PROCESSES SUPPORTING THE TRANSITION FROM
ADOLESCENT TO ADULT LEVEL COGNITIVE CONTROL
Beatriz Luna1; 1University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
Cognitive processes and their underlying brain systems are on line
early in development showing incremental integration into
adolescence. Subsequently, from adolescence to adulthood there is a
period of refinement leading to adult levels of stabilization in the
engagement of mature cognitive processes supporting improvements
in the rate and precision of executive responses. I will present fMRI
and MEG data on developmental changes in the instantiation of
cognitive brain states and cognitive network stability during cognitive
control and during rest. Results indicate that during working memory
(WM) performance there are increasingly more distinct brain patterns
of activity available with development. The engagement of relevant
cognitive brain tasks however show developmental decreases in the
variability of the magnitude of their engagement that are associated
with decreases in performance variability. In addition, we find
developmental enhancements in the temporal organization and
engagement of frontal network contributions during cognitive control.
In contrast, during rest, results indicate developmental decoupling of
regions in cognitive brain networks particularly at low frequency
oscillations. Together these results suggest that through adolescence

2017 Annual Meeting

there is evidence for refinement of cognitive brain systems supporting
increasing complexity of brain integration supporting stability and
flexibility of cognitive brain systems.
TALK 2: AT RISK OF BEING RISKY: THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN “BRAIN AGE” UNDER EMOTIONAL STATES AND
RISK PREFERENCE
Damien Fair1; 1Oregon Health & Science University School of
Medicine
Abstract: Developmental differences regarding decision-making are
often reported in the absence of emotional stimuli and without context,
failing to explain why some individuals are more likely to have a greater
inclination toward risk. In this work we will discuss the influence of
emotional context on underlying functional brain connectivity across
age and its impact on risk preference. Using functional imaging data
in a neutral brain-state we first identify the “brain age” of a given
individual then validate it with an independent measure of cortical
thickness. We then show, on average, that “brain age” across the
group during the teen years has the propensity to look younger in
emotional contexts. Further, we show this phenotype (i.e. a younger
brain age in emotional contexts) relates to a group mean difference in
risk perception – a pattern exemplified greatest in young-adults (ages
18-21). These results are suggestive of a specified functional brain
phenotype that relates to being at “risk to be risky.”
TALK 3: DECISION, REWARD, AND SOCIAL PROCESSING IN
ADOLESCENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT
Jason Chein1; 1Temple University
Maturational changes in brain networks that support decision, reward,
and social processing yield a developmental period, adolescence,
during which the ability to self-regulate behavior nears fully mature
levels but sensitivity to specific contextual factors is heightened. One
salient influence on adolescent behavior is social context, with
adolescents exhibiting especially increased sensitivity to the social
conditions under which their decisions and behavior are carried out.
While increased sensitivity to social context during adolescence can
have potentially deleterious manifestations (e.g., increased risk
taking), it can also have adaptive benefits (e.g., enhanced reward
learning). Through studies combining structural and functional
neuroimaging with laboratory assessments of risk-taking, cognitive
control, and reward sensitivity/learning, we have explored the specific
ways in which brain development enhances sensitivity to social inputs
during adolescence. In this work, we find that sensitivity to social
information is linked to network-level changes in the structural
morphology of the “social brain”, that social context has its strongest
impact on the outputs of reward-related processing centers (e.g.,
striatal and orbitofrontal regions), and that social context modulates
the dynamics of brain network interactions during decision processing,
with the anterior insula playing an especially important role in driving

Invited-Symposium Sessions

these dynamics. Our findings highlight the direct links between social
context and reward-related processes, but early evidence also
suggests that when conditions deplete the availability of cognitive
control resources they can exacerbate the impacts of social context,
while conditions that enhance the recruitment of control resources can
minimize social impacts on adolescent behavior.
TALK 4: MULTIPLE LEARNING SYSTEMS IN THE ADOLESCENT
BRAIN: THE INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATED LEARNING ON
EPISODIC MEMORY AND COGNITIVE CONTROL.
Juliet Y. Davidow1; 1Harvard University
Adolescents are known for being distinctly sensitive to motivational
cues, a characteristic that has been linked to heightened activity in the
brain’s reward systems. Rewards are critical for adaptively guiding
behavior but can differentially bias neural systems in ways that are
either beneficial or interruptive for other cognitive processes. In one
study, we show a beneficial role of motivational sensitivity. In a
probabilistic reinforcement learning task, adolescents showed better
motivated learning and a stronger link between learning and episodic
memory. This enhancement in learning was related to heightened
prediction error-related BOLD activity in the hippocampus and to
stronger functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the
striatum at the time of reinforcement. In another study, we show
impairment from motivational sensitivity. In a two-part task, a reward
association is conditioned to a neutral stimulus, then later used in a
classic cognitive control task. Adolescents showed greater impairment
for the cue with an associated reward history. This intrusion of the
previous reward association over the ability to inhibit a response was
related to activity in the striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex.
Together, this work highlights the potential to leverage the sensitivity
of adolescent motivational systems in ways that are advantageous, but
cautions that there are goal-directed behaviors that are susceptible to
intrusion from this bias.

ARE WE READY FOR REAL-WORLD NEUROSCIENCE
RESEARCH?

Chair: Pawel J. Matusz, University Hospital Centre (CHUV) University of Lausanne, Switzerland
Speakers: Alex Huth, Suzanne Dikker, Catherine Perrodin, Pawel
J. Matusz
Real-world environments are typically dynamic, complex, multisensory
in nature, and necessitate the support of top-down mechanisms for us
to be able to “see”. Fundamental principles of perception and brain
organisation have been established by research utilising wellcontrolled, but simplified, paradigms with basic stimuli. Drawing on
theoretical advances and those in computational power, brain
mapping, and signal-processing techniques, research has been
increasingly departing from traditional paradigms to understand the
brain-cognitive mechanisms governing perception in environments
containing one, or, more recently, multiple real-world environmental
attributes. Have we reached a point where we can confidently abandon
laboratory-based experiments? What are the exceptional insights
provided by research conducted in naturalistic environments?
Fundamental assumptions about perception or brain hierarchy have
been questioned - by studies adapting traditional paradigms to vary
task-relevance and (multi)sensory nature of stimulation. Have
contributions of these laboratory-based approaches effectively
rendered them obsolete? Alex Huth will discuss how studies using
audio-stories and movies advance our understanding of brain
representations of semantic knowledge. Suzanne Dikker will present
the novel insights provided by studying brain-to- brain synchrony
during classroom-based learning. Catherine Perrodin will illustrate

how human object recognition is better understood via necessarily labbased research on communication signals in non-human primates.
Lastly, Pawel Matusz will highlight how the classical visual-attention
paradigms can be adapted to vary also the (multi)sensory nature of
stimulation and selective-attention skills of observers, in order to
achieve a unique understanding of the brain and cognitive
mechanisms of naturalistic object perception in real-world scenarios.
TALK 1: USING VOXEL-WISE MODELING OF FMRI RESPONSES
TO NATURAL STORIES AND MOVIES TO STUDY SEMANTIC
REPRESENTATIONS IN HUMAN CORTEX
Alex Huth1; 1University of California, Berkeley
For decades neuroimaging has been used to investigate the
organization of the human brain. Even so, little is known about how
exactly the brain supports naturalistic perception. One issue is the
point hypothesis testing approach that has dominated neuroimaging.
This approach can have high statistical power for testing specific
hypotheses, but cannot accurately estimate effect sizes, leaving open
whether many “significant” findings are meaningful. Furthermore, it is
difficult to synthesize results from this approach into a coherent view
of cortical organization. We offer an alternative: voxelwise modeling
(VM) using natural stimuli. Here, subjects are presented with complex
natural stimuli while brain responses are recorded. Hypotheses about
how these stimuli are represented are instantiated as feature spaces
that are extracted from the stimuli. Then encoding models, which
predict responses based on linear combinations of features, are
estimated separately for each voxel. Critically, these models are
validated by predicting responses in held-out datasets that were not
used for model estimation. This makes it possible to directly estimate
the effect size of each model. Models are then examined to assess
what types of information are represented in each voxel. We show that

2017 Annual Meeting

this exploratory approach can construct complex and comprehensive
maps of cortical representations in two modalities: vision and
language. Already these results replicate findings from previous
hypothesis-driven studies (e.g. faces vs. objects, abstract vs. concrete
words) and also put these findings in context. This work demonstrates
how important naturalistic stimuli and data-driven approaches, like
voxelwise modelling, are for understanding real-world perception.
TALK 2: LEARNING AND CONNECTING IN THE REAL WORLD:
CONDUCTING NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH IN HIGH SCHOOL
CLASSROOMS AND MUSEUMS
Suzanne Dikker1,2; 1New York University, 2Utrecht University, the
Netherlands
Laboratory research has produced tremendous insight into how the
human brain supports learning and retention. Still, laboratorygenerated findings do not always straightforwardly generalize to realworld learning environments, such as schools. In an effort to bridge
the neuroscience laboratory and naturalistic learning settings, we
collaborated with New York City high schools to collect EEG data from
students as they engaged in natural classroom interactions. In one
school, brain-to-brain coherence analyses (Total Interdependence;
Wen et al., Neuroimage 2012) showed that the EEG signal was more
synchronized among students if they liked each other better, if they
were more socially aware, and when they enjoyed a class activity
better. For example, student engagement and brain-to-brain
synchrony were both higher while students watched videos on the
class topic than when the teacher lectured. In a second school,
students showed higher retention scores for class content presented
in videos than for content delivered during lectures. These findings
provide evidence pertaining to the neural basis of classroom social
dynamics and student engagement, two factors that have been found
critical for student learning (Reyes et al. J. Educ. Psychol. 2012). The
role of engagement in brain-to-brain synchrony is further supported by
EEG data collected from 700 museum visitors engaging in face-to-face
interaction: those people who reported more focus after than before
participating, also exhibited an increase in brain-to-brain synchrony
throughout the recording session. Taken together, our approach
allows us to generate rich datasets collected under ecologically natural
circumstances to complement laboratory-based research on
engagement and learning.
TALK 3: SOCIAL COMMUNICATION SIGNALS AS AUDITORY
OBJECTS: TRANSLATIONAL INSIGHTS FROM NEURONALLEVEL RESEARCH IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES
Catherine Perrodin1; 1University College London
We, humans, like many other social animals, primarily communicate
with each other by exchanging vocal sound patterns. The brains of
humans and rhesus macaques were found to contain analogous
temporal-lobe “voice” areas that preferentially respond to auditory

Symposium Sessions

communication signals. Yet the neuronal substrates underlying
primates’ expertise in accurately extracting and encoding information
from auditory communication signals had remained elusive.
Understanding this requires direct neuronal measurements at relevant
stations along the auditory cortical pathway, while socially-relevant
communication signals are presented to an awake behaving listener.
Here I discuss my recent work investigating the neuronal-level
representation of auditory (voice) and multisensory (voice-face)
communication signals along the anterior temporal lobe, using
extracellular recordings in nonhuman primates. This revealed, for
instance, that the apparently overlapping fMRI sensitivity to call type
(“what?”) vs caller identity (“who?”) in the anterior temporal lobe is
carried by segregated neuronal populations. We also found
considerable modulation of auditory spiking responses by
simultaneously presented visual faces within the voice area. I then
evaluate how these and other results in nonhuman animals
correspond to relevant findings in humans and inform our current
understanding of voice-face processing. I end with suggesting
avenues for future comparative research.Due to the functional analogy
between human and monkey voice areas, rhesus monkeys represent
an excellent animal model system for studying the neuronal
computations supporting the processing of social communication
signals, at a level of resolution that cannot be obtained in healthy
humans. Such neuronal-level comparative animal work, even in the
context of naturalistic information processing, is however only
attainable in tightly controlled lab environments, and requires walking
the fine line between artificial, impoverished experimental settings and
potentially confounded naturalistic situations. Thus, translating these
cross-species insights back to humans requires better bridging across
humans and animal models, involving combining identical and
complementary methods while moving further towards ethologicallyrelevant experiments.
TALK 4: BRAIN AND COGNITIVE MECHANISMS GOVERNING
OBJECT ATTENTIONAL SELECTION IN NATURALISTIC
ENVIRONMENTS
Pawel J. Matusz1; 1University Hospital Centre (CHUV) - University
of Lausanne, Switzerland
In real-world environments, objects are the currency of information
processing and object recognition necessitates their attentional
selection from among other objects. However, the brain and cognitive
mechanisms governing processing of task-relevant and task-irrelevant
objects remain poorly understood. First, I will demonstrate that, in
multisensory environments, selective and perceptual processing of
objects is controlled by integrated auditory-visual top-down object
representations (“attentional templates”) that operate via both “gain
control” and task-dependent brain network recruitment. Many
successive ”steps” comprising both perceptual and selective object
processing have been characterized with ERP recordings during
carefully manipulated, simplified unisensory tasks. Attentional

selection of objects is traditionally quantified via “the N2pc
component”: spatially-selective enhancements of neural processing of
objects within ventral cortices ~150-200ms post-stimulus. In the
spatial-cueing paradigm (Folk et al. 1992) adapted to multisensory
contexts, we found N2pc to spatially-uninformative visual cues to be
attenuated (and behavioural attention-capture effects weaker) during
audio-visual vs. visual search. We then reconsidered our data within
an electrical neuroimaging framework. Modulations in the average
strength of brain response - but not in average N2pc amplitude - to the
visual cues across the usual, 170-270ms time-window predicted the
strength of suppression of their behavioural capture effects in audiovisual search. In the subsequent time-window, however, visual cues
activated distinct brain sources depending on whether they matched
fully vs. partly the multisensory object template. Second, I will
demonstrate the importance of developed top-down control for
distraction in multisensory environments. Despite the increasing
popularity of brain mapping methods in developmental research,
large-size behavioural studies involving adaptations of wellunderstood adult visual-attention paradigms can provide vital insights
into the role of cognitive development in object processing. In our
response-competition task (Lavie & Cox 1997) adapted to childfriendly, multisensory contexts, 6-year-olds were paradoxically
“shielded” from distraction by peripheral target-matching audiovisual
coloured shapes when search became difficult. In adults and 10-yearolds, both easy and difficult search supported strong multisensory
distraction. Our ERP results reveal novel insights into the supramodal,
rather than sensory-specific nature of, and the role of flexible
mechanisms, other than just “gain control" in, top-down control of
attentional object selection in naturalistic,multisensory environments.
In turn, our developmentally-inspired work demonstrates the
importance of age-dependent trajectories leading to robust adult
attentional selection of multisensory objects. Collectively, these
findings highlight the unique insights into the brain-cognitive
mechanisms governing object processing in naturalistic environments
that are afforded by adapting rigorous visual-attention paradigms to
multisensory, demand- and capability-varying conditions.
Q&A PERIOD
The speakers will discuss the importance of real-world vs lab-based
experiments in advancing theoretical models of the brain and cognitive
mechanisms governing object processing in naturalistic environments,
and take questions from the audience.

Over the past thirty years, the field of cognitive neuroscience has
blossomed, painting a rich and detailed picture of the brain’s functional
architecture. Given the long-established heritability of diverse aspects
of cognitive and affective function and malfunction (e.g., in
developmental cognitive disorders and psychiatric illness), questions
naturally arise about the relationship between the brain’s functional
organization and the genetic architecture of neural development and
function. This symposium brings together four leaders in the emerging
field of imaging genetics to talk about i) what these questions are, ii)
the progress that has been made so far in addressing them, and iii)
the challenges that arise. The talks will cover a broad range of topics
and discuss findings from a wide range of methodologies, from
genome-wide association scans of thousands of people to search for
common DNA variants linked to brain anatomy and function
(Jahanshad and Fisher), to examining patterns of gene expression
across the cortex and their relationship to large-scale functional
networks (Konopka and Krienen) and the potential modulation of these
relationships by cognitive states (Konopka), to looking for correlations
between variation in the structure and function of speech and language
brain regions and genetic variability (Fisher), to examining differences
among primate species in patterns of gene expression at the single
cell level (Krienen). The overarching goal is to review the state of the
art in this area and to outline the key current and future directions.
TALK 1: (INTRODUCTION): GENETICS AND COGNITIVE
NEUROSCIENCE: HOW WE GOT HERE, WHERE WE ARE, AND
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.
Ev Fedorenko1; 1HMS, MGH
I will talk about the genesis of the field of imaging genetics, highlighting
some of the milestones whose confluence led to its emergence. I will
then survey the questions that drive research in this area, and the
methods that are currently available to tackle these questions. Finally,
I will discuss the challenges we are facing, and ways to potentially
overcome them to make faster progress. I will conclude by introducing
the four main speakers, who will tell us about some of the exciting
findings that are starting to illuminate the relationship between our
neural and genetic make-up.
TALK 2: TRANSLATING THE GENOME IN HUMAN COGNITIVE
NEUROSCIENCE
Simon Fisher1; 1MPI Nijmegen
Recent years have seen dramatic advances in the molecular
technologies used to study the genetic architecture underlying brain
development and function. My talk will illustrate the promise and pitfalls
for scientists studying human cognition in a postgenomic world. I will
discuss three complementary examples from the language sciences.

2017 Annual Meeting

First, low-cost genotyping makes it possible to carry out systematic
genome-wide association scans of many thousands of people,
allowing us to search for common DNA variants that may influence
speech, language and reading skills, not just in disorders but also in
the general population. Yet, we still face difficulties in reliably
characterizing relevant phenotypes in the cohorts being studied.
Second, the advent of whole-genome sequencing gives exciting
opportunities to discover rare disruptive mutations in developmental
speech/language disorders. However, pinpointing truly causative
mutations from next-generation sequencing data turns out to be
challenging. Testing the impact of mutations on gene/protein function
(for instance, using cellular models) will be key for the future of this
field. Third, researchers have begun looking for correlations between
variations in structure/function of language-related brain circuits
(indexed by neuroimaging) and variability at the genetic level (indexed
by genotyping). It has become clear that, even when studying the
human brain more directly, most DNA variants have small effect sizes.
Thus, careful study design, constraining the search space and
considering statistical power, is essential for ensuring that
neuroimaging genetic investigations of language deliver robust results.
Ultimately, if emerging tools and methods are used wisely, there is
enormous potential for successfully bridging gaps between genes,
neurons, circuits and human cognition.
TALK 3: THE GENETICS OF BRAIN STRUCTURE AND ITS
FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE — AN INTERNATIONAL
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT
Neda Jahanshad1; 1USC
In collaborative efforts involving over 300 scientists from around the
world, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging and Genetics through MetaAnalysis Consortium, ENIGMA, has led the discovery of common
genetic variants that shape the structure of the living brain as seen
through MRI. Genome-wide association studies of regional brain
volumes in up to 33,000 individuals have identified dozens of genetic
loci that significantly impact brain structural variations. ENIGMA has
extended its efforts to discover the genetic influence over variability in
cortical structure and its white matter connections, identifying many
more genetic loci that influence brain structure. However, the neurobehavior and functional outcome of these specific findings may not be
fully understood. Congruent works from other consortia are
discovering the genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders and behaviors,
and the genetic overlap with brain variability may now be studied,
allowing us to identify what neuroanatomical structures, pathways and
networks are compromised with genetic susceptibility for the condition.
Here, we will outline methods of identifying genetic overlap between
diseases, cognition, and brain structure and present the latest findings
from the ENIGMA Consortium that map out networks of brain structural
variation genetically correlated with behavior and cognitive traits.
ENIGMA is an open consortium and welcomes all researchers with
brain imaging data to join in on efforts to unlock the genetic factors that

shape our brain’s structure and function, and identify the neurological
mechanisms relating to human behavior, cognition and
neuropsychiatric disease.
TALK 4: LINKING GENES TO BEHAVIOR USING HUMAN BRAIN
GENE EXPRESSION DATA
Genevieve Konopka1; 1UT Southwestern Medical Center
Genetic studies have identified specific genomic loci associated either
with cognition in general or with cognitive disorders such as autism or
schizophrenia. However, the functional consequences of these
genetic variants remain mostly to be determined. In particular, the
normal expression and function of these identified genes in the human
brain and whether these patterns are altered in cognitive diseases is
an ongoing field of inquiry. We have shown that post-mortem human
brain gene expression can be harnessed to provide insight into active
human brain states. There is direct correspondence between human
brain gene expression and resting-state brain activity as assessed by
fMRI. Unanswered questions remain though such as whether these
correlations change when subjects are actively carrying out specific
cognitive tasks or whether these correlations change in individuals
who have cognitive disorders. I will present data to address both of
these questions. We have carried out comparisons of human brain
gene expression with intracranial EEG data from individuals while they
are carrying out a memory task. We find that the genes correlated with
memory encoding are different than those correlated with human brain
activity in the resting state. We have also investigated whether there
are genes that have differential correlation with human brain activity in
the resting state in patients with autism, strengthening the importance
of altered functional connectivity in autism pathophysiology as a
consequence of disrupted gene expression networks. These data
provide functional confirmation of the genetic basis of cognition and
cognitive disorders.
TALK 5: TRANSCRIPTIONAL VARIATION ASSOCIATED WITH
CORTICAL SPECIALIZATION AND CONNECTIVITY
Fenna Krienen1; 1HMS
The human brain is patterned with large, distributed networks that
connect distant regions together. The expansion of the neocortex has
also led to the emergence of regions with specialized functions,
particularly in association cortex, that are important for cognition.
Differences in functional specialization and connectivity may arise
from differences in the underlying molecular architecture in regions
that support long-range connectivity networks. Our work using the
Allen Institute’s human brain transcriptional atlas indicates that genes
enriched in supragranular layers of the human cerebral cortex (relative
to mouse) distinguish major cortical subtypes (sensory/motor,
paralimbic, associational). The pattern of transcriptional expression of
these genes is associated with large-scale brain network organization
measured by functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI). These results raise
Cognitive Neuroscience Society

29

Symposium Sessions

questions of whether this transcriptional phenotype is unique to
humans or conserved across other primates. I will discuss our recent
efforts to characterize what is unique and what is shared between
primate species in patterns of gene expression at the single cell level.
These data can help us build a system for understanding cortical
specializations across association and primary sensory cortices in
primate evolution.

Symposium Session 3
MULTIVARIATE APPROACHES FOR NEURAL DYNAMICS:
IT’S ABOUT TIME
Sunday, March 26, 1:30 - 3:30 pm, Ballroom B/C
Chair: Alex Clarke, University of Cambridge
Speakers: Michael Wolff, Anna Jafarpour, Hyojin Park, Tobias
Staudigl, Alex Clarke
This symposium showcases emerging multivariate techniques to study
the rapid and dynamic processes underlying human cognition. It is
undoubted that cognition is achieved in a highly dynamic and
interactive brain, yet current research does not fully take into account
such dynamics. While techniques like multivariate pattern analysis
(MVPA) have become a cornerstone of fMRI research, enabling us to
better understand representations and neural coding, fMRI is
inherently limited due to its lack of sensitivity to time and dynamics.
MEG and EEG provide a prime opportunity to study how neural
representations change over time, with multivariate techniques playing
an increasingly prominent role. In this symposium we highlight how
multivariate analyses of time-sensitive data can reveal novel insights
into the dynamics of cognitive processes. This will be shown across a
broad range of domains including vision, language and memory,
illuminating how these techniques can drive cognitive theories forward.
TALK 1: IMPULSE PERTURBATIONS REVEAL DYNAMIC
WORKING MEMORY STATES IN EEG
Michael Wolff1, Janina Jochim2, Timothy Buschman3, Elkan
Akyurek1, Mark Stokes2; 1University of Groningen, 2University of
Oxford, 3Princeton University
It has been suggested that working memory (WM) can be maintained
in a silent neural network that is not reliant on continuous WM specific
neural activity. In order to measure such activity silent networks, we
recently developed an approach that is analogous to echolocation,
where a neutral “impulse” stimulus can reveal otherwise hidden neural
states in electroencephalography (EEG). Here we report the impulsespecificity of the revealed neural pattern to attended and unattended
WM content at different time-points during a visual WM task. Human
participants performed a two-item WM task while EEG was recorded.
Two randomly orientated visual gratings were presented in the
beginning of each trial, and a retro-cue indicated which item would
later be tested, rendering the uncued item task-irrelevant. Two neutral
30

Cognitive Neuroscience Society

2017 Annual Meeting

impulse stimuli were presented at fixed time-points in the subsequent
delay, before participants reported the cued item using free-recall. The
neural responses elicited by the impulse contained activity patterns
specific to the cued but not the uncued item. Such WM-specific
impulse response functions are also predictive of behavioural
performance. This provides clear evidence that the impulse response
in WM tasks is specific to WM content, not just stimulation history in
general. Furthermore, cross-temporal decoding across the two distinct
impulse patterns showed little cross-generalization, suggesting that
the underlying WM network changes dynamically over time.

TALK 2: WORKING MEMORY REPLAY PRIORITIZES WEAKLY
ATTENDED EVENTS
Anna Jafarpour1, Will Penny2, Gareth Barnes2, Robert T. Knight1,
Emrah Duzel2,3; 1University of California, Berkeley, 2University
College London, 3Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg
The dominant view of working memory posits that maintaining a series
of events requires sequential mnemonic replay. We addressed this
using magnetoencephalography (MEG) wherein participants encoded
sequences of three stimuli depicting a face, a chair or a fruit, and
maintained them in working memory for 5 seconds. Decoding of brain
activity revealed that only one of the three stimuli dominated
maintenance independent of its sequence position or category; and
memory for the selectively replayed stimulus was enhanced. The
selectively replayed stimulus had the weakest initial encoding indexed
by weaker visual attention signals. These findings challenge the
sequential replay theory of working memory and indicate that
prioritized replay of weakly encoded events maximizes the fidelity of
sequence recall.
TALK 3: NEURAL DECOMPOSITION OF SYNERGISTIC AND
REDUNDANT INFORMATION IN INTERACTION BETWEEN
AUDIOVISUAL SPEECH RHYTHMS AND BRAIN OSCILLATIONS
Hyojin Park1, Robin A. A. Ince1, Joachim Gross1; 1University of
Glasgow
During audiovisual speech processing, auditory and visual information
interact and are integrated leading to a unified percept of speech.
Previously, we have shown that low-frequency brain oscillations
separately track auditory and visual speech signals to facilitate speech
comprehension. However, it is still unclear to what extent auditory and
visual information is represented in brain areas, either individually or
jointly. Here, we applied a recently developed tool from Information
Theory to decompose multivariate mutual information between
auditory, visual and brain signals. This method allows quantification of
the unique information the brain signals carry for each modality
(auditory, visual). Furthermore, we can now address the question if
activity in a certain brain area carries a synergistic or redundant
representations of both sensory signals. We used low-frequency theta

2017 Annual Meeting

phase of auditory and visual speech signals and brain signals at
each voxel measured by MEG. In an adverse audiovisual speech
condition, where attention to visual speech is critical for speech
comprehension, we found redundant information in auditory/temporal
regions, including posterior superior temporal gyrus, and synergistic
information in left motor and inferior temporal cortex. Importantly, this
predicted speech comprehension. By means of these novel
information theoretic tools, we show for the first time, evidence for
neural decomposition of information of entrained audiovisual speech
rhythms interacting with brain oscillations for facilitating speech
comprehension. Our finding demonstrates how the brain processes
audiovisual inputs efficiently - taking advantage of common
information as well as making greater information from multisensory
inputs that enable remarkable ability in human communication.
TALK 4: SACCADIC EYE MOVEMENTS ARE PHASE-LOCKED TO
POSTERIOR ALPHA OSCILLATIONS AND MODULATE NEURAL
COMMUNICATION DURING MEMORY FORMATION – EVIDENCE
FROM MEG, FMRI AND INTRACRANIAL DATA
Tobias Staudigl1, Isabella C. Wagner1, Elisabeth Hartl2, Soheyl
Noachtar2, Christian F. Doeller1,3, Ole Jensen1,4; 1Radboud
University Nijmegen, 2University of Munich, 3Kavli Institute for
Systems Neuroscience, 4University of Birmingham
The sampling of visual information is assumed to be discrete rather
than continuous (VanRullen & Koch, 2003), possibly clocked by alpha
oscillations at 7-12 Hz (VanRullen et al., 2011). This relatively slow
sampling period at 80-140 ms seems at odds with the remarkably fast
processing speed of the visual system. This conundrum could partly
be resolved if saccades are locked to the phase of ongoing visual
oscillations, as investigated in this study. We simultaneously recorded
MEG and eye-tracking data from 36 healthy participants during a free
viewing encoding task of natural pictures, followed by a memory test.
MEG encoding data were aligned to saccade onsets. Significantly
higher phase-locking in the alpha band (12 Hz) prior to saccades was
found for subsequently remembered vs. forgotten pictures. The source
of this effect was localized to the parieto-occipital cortex. Intracranial
data recorded directly from occipital and parietal cortex of epilepsy
patients provided converging results. Additionally, fMRI data was
collected to investigate saccade-related hippocampal activation and
connectivity with the parieto-occipital cortex during memory formation.
The study provides evidence that saccades and brain oscillations are
coordinated. This coordination determines what the brain encodes.
The results suggest that saccades are timed to the dynamic state of
the brain, such that retinal inputs are temporally aligned to the ‘optimal’
phase of the alpha rhythm. Concurrent connectivity analyses of
intracranial, MEG and fMRI data will provide insights into the
communication between the visual system and the hippocampus
during memory formation, and how this communication is modulated
by saccades.

TALK 5: UNDERSTANDING MEANING FROM OUR SENSES:
REPRESENTATIONAL SIMILARITY ANALYSIS OF SOURCELOCALISED MEG SIGNALS
Alex Clarke1, Ece Kocagoncu1, Barry Devereux1, Lorraine K.
Tyler1; 1University of Cambridge
Meaning is extracted from sensory inputs through dynamic
transformations of information. Representational Similarity Analysis
(RSA) for source-localised MEG signals has the promise to uncover
representational transformations over time. RSA determines the
information represented in distributed activity patterns. The core
principle of RSA is similar stimuli, for example objects with a similar
shape, produce similar activity patterns in a region that represents this
information. By analysing the similarity of neural activity, and how this
relates to the similarity of stimulus properties, we can uncover what
information is coded in neural signals. Here we show the utility of RSA
for source-localised MEG signals. Drawing on two examples, we show
how RSA for MEG can reveal the representational transformations
during object recognition and speech comprehension. First, we show
how alpha oscillatory spatio-temporal patterns in early visual cortex
represent low-level visual properties of objects, while object category
information is subsequently represented in IT cortex. Further, we show
that oscillatory phase signals carry more information than power.
Second, using single spoken words and searchlight analysis of MEG
source localised signals, we show how lexical and semantic
competition engage posterior middle temporal and inferior frontal
regions during early spoken input - when word identity remains
ambiguous. As the speech input unfolds and the word becomes
uniquely identifiable, semantic effects emerge in the middle temporal
and angular gyrus. These studies highlight how RSA for MEG sourcelocalised data can reveal dynamic representational transformations as
we understand meaning from our senses.

Symposium Session 4
WORKING MEMORY: SUSTAINED ACTIVITY OR
DYNAMICS?
Monday, March 27, 10:00 am - Noon, Ballroom A
Chair: Tim Buschman, Princeton University
Speakers: Earl Miller, Tatiana Pasternak, Mark Stokes, John
Murray
Working memory is a fundamental component of cognition; providing
the workspace on which we hold and manipulate thoughts.
Traditionally, the contents of working memory have been thought to be
represented in the sustained firing activity of neurons. Indeed, this
viewpoint is supported by a rich history of neurophysiological results
and theoretical models. However, recent work has begun to challenge
this viewpoint, arguing that mnemonic representations are instead
dynamic, changing over time. In this symposium, we propose to bring
together four experts on the neural representation of working memory
in order to contrast the sustained and dynamic models of working

Symposium Sessions

memory. First, Earl Miller will present evidence that working memory
representations are highly dynamic, bubbling up in small bursts of
activity. Second, Tania Pasternak will show working memory is the
result of continuous interactions between prefrontal and sensory
cortices. Third, Mark Stokes will provide evidence for ‘silent’ working
memory representations that rely on short-term synaptic changes
instead of changes in neural activity. Finally, John Murray will show a
stable representation can be decoded from a population of neurons,
even if individual neurons are themselves highly dynamic. Together,
these speakers will provide four unique viewpoints on the nature of
working memory representations, enabling a lively debate on what is
the neural code of working memory.
TALK 1: WORKING MEMORY: SUSTAINED ACTIVITY? NOT SO
MUCH.
Earl Miller1; 1Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Working memory is thought to result from sustained neuron spiking.
However, computational models suggest complex dynamics with
discrete oscillatory bursts. We analyzed local field potential (LFP) and
spiking from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys performing a
working memory task. There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma
oscillations (45-100 Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying
encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at
a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the tobe-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20-35 Hz) also occurred in
brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by
encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting
encoding/decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate.
Thus, gamma bursts could gate access to, and prevent sensory
interference with, working memory. This supports the hypothesis that
working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and
spiking, not sustained activity.
TALK 2: NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF WORKING MEMORY FOR
VISUAL MOTION
Tatiana Pasternak1; 1University of Rochester
To perform a ubiquitous task of comparing sensory stimuli across time
and/or space, subjects must identify these stimuli, retain them in
memory and retrieve them at the time of comparison. Thus, the
circuitry underlying such tasks must involve cortical regions subserving sensory processing, maintenance, attention and decisionmaking. In our work we have been examining the circuitry sub-serving
working memory for visual motion, with the focus on two reciprocally
interconnected regions, the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the
motion processing area MT. We have characterized the activity in both
areas during motion comparison tasks, identifying signals in the LPFC
likely to represent bottom-up motion information supplied by MT
neurons and signals in area MT likely to represent the top-down
influences from LPFC. I will discuss the evidence that the content of

32

Cognitive Neuroscience Society

2017 Annual Meeting

task-related activity in MT and LPFC is a product of continuous
interactions between neurons in the two areas during which they
process and exchange signals generated during all stages of memoryguided sensory comparisons.
TALK 3: STABILITY OF MIND IN A DYNAMIC BRAIN: WORKING
MEMORY FROM A DYNAMIC CODING FRAMEWORK
Mark Stokes1; 1Oxford University
The cognitive neuroscience of working memory faces a major
challenge: brain activity is highly dynamic. At first glance these
dynamics seem at odds with the very nature of working memory. How
can we keep a stable thought in mind while brain activity is constantly
changing? Indeed, some of the most influential models in
neuroscience are built on the first-level intuition that stability of mind
depends on stable brain activity. Standard models often assume that
working memory is maintained by static patterns of neural activity, as
if frozen in time to preserve a still-frame representation of the past.
Here we take a different approach. Within the framework of dynamic
coding, we propose that working memory is best understood as a
temporary shift in how we process new information, rather than a
representation of the past preserved in persistent activity. We explore
potential neural mechanisms for dynamic coding, including short-term
synaptic connectivity, and consider novel methods for exploring such
‘activity-silent’ neural states of working memory.
TALK 4: STABLE POPULATION CODING FOR WORKING
MEMORY COEXISTS WITH HETEROGENEOUS NEURAL
DYNAMICS IN PREFRONTAL CORTEX
John Murray1; 1Yale University
In primate cortex, electrophysiological studies find stimulus-selective
persistent activity in single neurons as neural correlates of working
memory. However, recent studies have highlighted cellular
heterogeneity and strong temporal variations in delay activity, at
single-neuron and population levels. It remains unclear how neuronal
populations maintain memory of stimuli despite complex and
heterogeneous temporal dynamics. To address this question, we
applied population-level analyses to hundreds of recorded singleneurons from lateral prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing two
seminal tasks that demand parametric working memory: oculomotor
delayed response, and vibrotactile delayed discrimination. We found
that despite complex and heterogeneous temporal dynamics in singleneuron activity, prefrontal cortex activity is endowed with a populationlevel coding of the mnemonic stimulus that is stable and robust
throughout working memory maintenance, enabling robust and
generalizable decoding compared to time-optimized subspaces. To
explore potential mechanisms, we applied these same populationlevel analyses to theoretical neural circuit models of working memory
activity. Three previously proposed models failed to capture the key
population-level features observed empirically. We propose network

2017 Annual M eeting

connectivity properties, implemented in a linear network model, which
can underlie these features. This work uncover stable population-level
working memory representations in prefrontal cortex, despite strong
temporal neural dynamics, thereby providing new insights into neural
circuit mechanisms supporting working memory.
Q&A PERIOD
Speakers will engage in a discussion on the nature of working memory
representations. In particular, we will directly compare the traditional
sustained activity model with more recent dynamic encoding models.
Discussion will be led by symposium organizer (Tim Buschman) but
questions and participation from the audience will also be encouraged.

Symposium Session 5
COGNITIVE MAPS IN THE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX
FOR GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR
Monday, March 27, 10:00 am - Noon, Bayview
Chair: Thorsten Kahnt, Northwestern University
Speakers: Nicolas W. Schuck, Peter Rudebeck, Geoffrey
Schoenbaum, Erie Boorman, Thorsten Kahnt
In contrast to habitual action, goal-directed behavior is sensitive to the
current value of stimuli, actions, and outcomes, all of which depend on
the state of the organism and the environment. Decades of research
have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is important for goaldirected behavior; what has remained unclear is which representations
and computations are processed within this region that make it so
critical for these behaviors. A recent proposal is that the OFC contains
“cognitive maps” of the task space, which represent the current state
of the environment that is relevant for the decision at hand. Such maps
could be used to perform simulations and make inferences about the
value of unexperienced states and outcomes. One central prediction
of this hypothesis is that OFC activity must represent far more than
expected value, but all relevant features of the current decision
problem, such as outcome identity, context contingencies, and other
unobservable variables that are necessary for optimal behavior.
Speakers in this symposium will discuss recent results from
experiments across species (rodents, monkeys, and humans) and
methods (lesions, electrophysiology, optogenetics, and pattern-based
fMRI) that test different aspects of this hypothesis. Together, the
findings presented in these talks provide evidence that the OFC
supports goal-directed behavior through a cognitive map of the state
space, which may complement spatial maps previously identified in
the hippocampus.

TALK 1: ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX REPRESENTS A
COGNITIVE MAP OF STATE SPACE
Nicolas W. Schuck1; 1Princeton University
Much research has suggested a role of OFC in learning as well as
decision-making, but what precisely that role is remains unclear. We
recently hypothesized that the OFC contains a ‘‘cognitive map’’ of task
space in which the current state of the task is represented. This
representation is especially critical for decision-making and learning
when states are unobservable from sensory input. To test this idea,
we apply pattern- classification techniques to neuroimaging data from
humans performing a decision-making task with 16 states. We show
that (a) unobservable task states can be decoded from activity in OFC,
(b) decoding accuracy is related to task performance and the
occurrence of individual behavioral errors and that (c) similarity
between the neural representations of consecutive states correlates
with behavior. Moreover, I will present recent results that offer insights
into how OFC’s state representation changes with task practice.
Overall, our results support the idea that OFC represents a cognitive
map of task space.
TALK 2: GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR AND COGNITIVE MAPS IN
MONKEY ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX: EVIDENCE FROM LESION
AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGY STUDIES
Peter Rudebeck1; 1Mount Sinai
Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to play a central role in goaldirected behaviors. A development of this idea is that OFC is involved
in representing maps of task space. This latter idea has had a profound
effect on thinking about the functions of OFC, but there is still
uncertainty about which parts of OFC are critical for goal-directed
behavior and the neural mechanisms of task space. Here I will
describe two experiments in monkeys that have: 1) helped to define
the specific parts of OFC that are involved in goal-directed behavior,
and 2) provide some evidence of encoding of task space in OFC. The
first experiment showed that the OFC, specifically Walker’s areas 11
and 13, and not other parts of OFC are critical for goal-directed
behavior as assessed by the reinforcer devaluation task. The second
experiment, compared how neurons in OFC encoded stimulus-reward
values when the map of task space was stable through over learning
versus then when subjects had to construct task space through
learning which stimuli were associated with the greatest reward value.
Fewer neurons in OFC encoded stimulus-reward values when
stimulus-reward values had to be constructed as opposed to when
they were well learned. One potential explanation for these differences
in encoding is that during learning, the task space represented in OFC
(i.e. stimulus attributes) is pruned until only those that lead to the
greatest amount of reward are encoded across the neurons in OFC.
These data help to constrain theoretical accounts of OFC function.

TALK 3: ORBITOFRONTAL STATE REPRESENTATIONS FALL
APART IN INTERESTING WAYS WITHOUT HIPPOCAMPAL
OUTPUT

TALK 5: FLEXIBLE STATE REPRESENTATIONS OF SPECIFIC
REWARDS IN THE HUMAN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX

Geoffrey Schoenbaum1; 1NIH/NIDA IRP

Goal-directed behavior is sensitive to the current value of specific
rewards. This requires independent and outcome-specific
representations of reward that can be updated “on the fly” based on
changes in the internal or external environment. The orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) has been proposed to host such state representations in
the form of cognitive maps. In principle, specific updates could be
implemented either by changing representations of specific rewards
directly in OFC, or by changing the assignment of value to these
rewards, either within OFC, or in downstream regions such as
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). To shed light on how
representations of specific rewards are updated in the human OFC,
we utilized sensory-specific devaluation of appetizing food odors in
combination with a decision-making task and pattern-based
neuroimaging. We find that after selective satiety, reward identity
representations in lateral OFC were diminished for the sated food
odor, but retained for the non-sated counterpart. In addition, identity
general decision signals in the vmPFC were similarly maintained for
the non-sated, but not for the sated reward identity. We find that
functional connectivity between the OFC and the vmPFC was
modulated by satiety such that connectivity was stronger for non-sated
compared to sated odors after the meal. Moreover, these connectivity
changes were correlated with individual differences in satiety-related
choice behavior. These findings demonstrate how state
representations of specific rewards in the OFC are flexibly updated by
devaluation and linked to identity-general decision values in the
vmPFC to guide goal-directed behavior.

The OFC has been posited as a "cognitive map" of task state,
encoding relationships between the cues in the world that determine
when different behaviors are relevant. The hippocampus has also
been identified as a cognitive map, largely due to its prominent spatial
tuning. The emerging similarity in the proposed roles of these two
areas is intriguing, particularly because there is relatively little work
relating the two areas, despite a strong anatomical relationship. Thus
the hippocampus might support OFC state representations by
signaling spatial information or hippocampal input might convey
higher-order relationships between combinations of disparate features
of the world. To distinguish between these possibilities, we
optogenetically inactivated neurons in the ventral subiculum, while
recording single unit activity in the OFC of rats performing an odorguided decision task that required rats to represent spatial information
while also integrating it with information about the identity and value of
expected outcomes. We found that rats were slower to adjust to
changes in action–outcome contingencies when hippocampal output
was suppressed. In addition, ventral subiculum inactivation caused a
strong reduction in spatial encoding related to the action the rats
executed on each trial. However, suppressing hippocampal output
also abolished integration of the other features of the expected
outcome. Thus without hippocampus, single units and ensembles in
OFC were able to represent either the identity or the value of the
expected outcome, but they did not represent the location nor were
they able to effectively integrate identity and value on individual trials.
TALK 4: COMPUTATIONAL AND REPRESENTATIONAL
ANALYSIS APPROACHES TO ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING
Erie Boorman1; 1UC Davis
Behavioral neuroscience has made dramatic strides through the
combination of formal models of behavior with neural signals. One key
example is the prediction error – a central component of many learning
algorithms. Prediction errors may refer to value estimates, outcome
identities, or social attributes, among other variables. I will present a
series of studies that highlight how formal models can be used as a
bridge between neural activity, and learning behavior, in this variety of
forms. I will then show how ‘representational’ analysis techniques –
namely cross-stimulus suppression and multivariate pattern analysis –
can be used to probe the impact of prediction errors on neural
representations locally or in distant brain regions. The coupling of
computational models of behavior with such ‘representational analysis’
approaches holds promise for probing the trial-by-trial dynamics of
other learning and representation questions.

TOP-DOWN FUNCTIONS OF NEURAL OSCILLATIONS FOR
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
Monday, March 27, 10:00 am - Noon, Ballroom B/C
Chair: Lars Meyer, Department of Neuropsychology, Max Planck
Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig,
Germany
Speakers: Lars Meyer, Nicola Molinaro, Lin Wang, Malte
Wöstmann, Benedikt Zoefel
Research on the neural oscillations underlying speech perception has
an enormous momentum, but the oscillatory interaction of top-down
cognitive mechanisms (e.g., attention) and linguistic knowledge (e.g.,
syntax, semantics) with bottom-up auditory processing is poorly
understood. The progressive work of our speakers shows how
oscillations interact top-down with the readout of speech rhythms
through linguistic prediction formation, adjustment of information
extraction abilities, and selective attention. Lars Meyer will argue that
low-frequency oscillations do not only serve to impose abstract
syntactic structure upon the speech stream, but also to align sensory

2017 Annual Meeting

attention with linguistic informativity. Nicola Molinaro will highlight the
causal role of low-frequency oscillations in driving the interaction
between cortices that track speech and cortices that modulate speech
tracking. Lin Wang will highlight the role of pre-stimulus oscillatory
power in the generation and evaluation of contextual predictions for
upcoming linguistic input. Malte Wöstmann will show how selective
attention in multi-stream situations modulates the oscillatory read-out
of speech acoustics. Benedikt Zoefel will illustrate that speech
entrainment can persist in the absence of pronounced acoustic
rhythms, indicating that the auditory system is able to extract and
adjust to high-level features that are present in the speech signal and
intimately linked with comprehension. Our timely symposium
advertises the powerful mechanism of neural oscillations at the
interface of speech perception, domain-general cognition, and
language comprehension. The symposium will benefit auditory
neuroscientists, neurolinguists, and CNS members from neighboring
domains to further explore the roles of neural oscillations in the
dynamic interplay between bottom-up and top-down processes.
TALK 1: DELTA-BAND OSCILLATIONS IMPOSE SYNTACTIC
STRUCTURE UPON SPEECH, ALIGNING EXCITABILITY WITH
LINGUISTIC INFORMATIVITY
Lars Meyer1; 1Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain
Sciences, Leipzig, Germany
Speech perception is often conceptualized as a bottom-up process
that relies on the tracking of acoustic rhythms by phase-synchronized
neural oscillations. Recent work indicated that such tracking isn’t
restricted to acoustic rhythms, but does also occur in response to the
abstract syntactic structure that speech symbolizes. Based on two
electroencephalography studies, I will here argue that synchronicity
between delta-band neural oscillations and syntactic structure does
not reflect a mere tracking, but an imposition based on individual
linguistic preferences—top-down aligning sensory attention with highlevel linguistic informativity. First, I will show that via delta-band
oscillatory phase, internal syntactic preferences can top-down drive
sentence interpretations that contradict bottom-up acoustic cues—
decreasing speech entrainment of delta-band oscillations. Second, I
will show that once in synchronicity with the internally generated
syntactic structure, the phase progression of the delta-band oscillation
sets sensory attention (as indexed by the amplitude of canonical
event-related brain potentials to linguistic violations) into an optimal
alignment with linguistic complexity (as quantified by informationtheoretic metrics). Delta-band neural oscillations thus appear to
subserve powerful top-down mechanisms that harmonize the speech
percept with internal requirements of information extraction—likely
compensating for the ambiguity and sparse rhythmicity of speech
acoustics.

Symposium Sessions

TALK 2: LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS MEDIATE TOPDOWN ACTIVITY DURING SPEECH PROCESSING
Nicola Molinaro1; 1Basque Center on Cognition, Brain, and
Language, San Sebastian, Spain
Speech processing involves neural oscillatory activity within a frontotemporo-parietal network that track quasi-rhythmic speech
modulations in different frequency bands (prosodic - delta band -,
syllabic - theta - and phonemic information - gamma). Different
mechanisms (de-multiplexing and segmentation steps) have been
proposed to deal with the mapping of these spectral components into
abstract phonological representations. Less is known about the topdown mechanisms that play a crucial role in natural speech. Speech
processing models associate neural computations in temporal regions
to perceptual speech sampling processes, while operations in frontalparietal regions are linked to higher-order processes (such as
attention). Still, there is no comprehensive view of the neural dynamics
that allow perceptual and top-down processes to interact while
extracting meaning from speech. In a set of studies (in which we also
manipulated the informativity of simultaneous visual cues for speech
perception), we analyzed MEG data from normal hearers while they
were listening to continuous speech. First, we determined how
different brain areas within the fronto-temporo-parietal network deal
with the de-multiplexing (Coherence analysis) and the segmentation
(Phase Amplitude Coupling analysis) pre-processing steps. Then, we
showed (Transfer Entropy analysis) how low-frequency (delta and
theta band) neural oscillations mediate the interaction between
temporal brain regions (where gamma activity reflect speech
sampling) and fronto-parietal areas (which gather contextually relevant
information to modulate sampling activity). Our findings provide
compelling evidence that low-frequency oscillatory brain dynamics,
during continuous speech, mediate the complex interactions between
the different nodes of the speech processing network.
TALK 3: LANGUAGE PREDICTION IS SUPPORTED BY
COUPLING BETWEEN FRONTAL GAMMA AND POSTERIOR
ALPHA OSCILLATIONS
Lin Wang1; 1Tufts University, Medford, USA
Readers and listeners actively predict upcoming words during
language processing. These predictions might serve to support the
unification of incoming words into sentence context and thus rely on
interactions between areas in the language network. In the current
magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, participants read sentences
that varied in contextual constraints so that the predictability of the
sentence-final words was either high or low. Prior to the sentence-final
words, we observed stronger alpha power suppression for the highly
compared to lowly constraining sentences in left inferior frontal cortex,
left posterior temporal region, and visual word form area (VWFA).
Importantly, the temporal and VWFA alpha power correlated
negatively with left frontal gamma power for the highly constraining
Cognitive Neuroscience Society

35

Symposium Sessions

sentences, in both the prediction and integration periods of the
sentence-final words. We suggest that this negative correlation
reflects the initiation of an anticipatory unification process in the
language network. Our study extends previous research on the
function of alpha oscillations by demonstrating that decreased alpha
power reflects the engagement of higher-level language areas and
that language processing might be implemented by the coupling
between the alpha and gamma activities.
TALK 4: ATTENTION GOVERNS NEURAL OSCILLATORY
RESPONSES TO SPEECH
Malte Wöstmann1; 1University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany
Speech comprehension requires listeners to dynamically regulate
auditory attention. Listeners must follow (i.e., “track” sensorily) the
target speech signal but also disengage (i.e., “functionally inhibit”)
brain areas processing distracting information. The phase of slow
neural oscillations (~1–5 Hz) faithfully tracks speech signals, while the
power of alpha oscillations (~8–12 Hz) reflects inhibition of irrelevant
distraction.
I
will
present
two
human
magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG) studies that demonstrate how
selective attention governs neural alpha oscillations to selectively
block the read-out of sensorily-tracked distractor speech. First, when
attending to one of two spatially separated speech streams (n = 19),
listeners’ sensory entrainment (1–5 Hz phase-locking) and alpha
power lateralisation in the MEG were in sync with ongoing speech, but
with a ~140° phase lag of alpha power. Notably, the extent to which
listeners rhythmically modulated auditory and parietal alpha power
predicted their ability to successfully attend. Second, when ignoring an
acoustically degraded speech distractor (n = 23), listeners’ neural
alpha oscillatory power was not driven by bottom-up speech acoustics
per se but by the focus of top-down attention: Alpha power decreases
when better acoustics facilitates comprehension of attended speech,
but here, alpha power instead increased as better acoustics of the tobe-ignored speech aggravated distraction. In sum, these data
demonstrate how auditory attention utilises two complementary neural
oscillatory mechanisms of low-frequency, phase-locked speech
tracking versus alpha power-mediated, non-phase-locked attentional
filtering.
TALK 5: LOW– AND HIGH-LEVEL PROCESSES UNDERLYING
OSCILLATORY PHASE ENTRAINMENT TO SPEECH SOUNDS
Benedikt Zoefel1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
Cambridge, UK
Neural oscillations adjust their phase to rhythmic stimulation, a
phenomenon called phase entrainment. This mechanism seems to be
of particular importance for the processing of speech: Assumed to
underlie speech comprehension, phase entrainment is omnipresent in
current theories of speech processing. Nevertheless, speech is a
complex stimulus and both low- and high-level processes might

36

Cognitive Neuroscience Society

2017 Annual Meeting

contribute to phase entrainment as it is commonly reported in the
literature. Our aim was to disentangle these processes and provide a
detailed characterization of the neural mechanisms underlying phase
entrainment to speech. For this purpose, we constructed speech/noise
stimuli without systematic fluctuations in sound amplitude or spectral
content (here termed “low-level” features), while keeping both
fluctuations in high-level features (including phonetic information) and
intelligibility. In human psychophysical and electroencephalographic
(EEG) data as well as primate intracranial recordings, we were able to
show that phase entrainment can be observed in response to speech
sounds in which systematic fluctuations in low-level features have
been removed. This “high-level” entrainment shows specific
characteristics and seems to reflect a particularly efficient mechanism
of speech processing which is conserved across species. Finally, the
relation between phase entrainment and speech comprehension
remains debated. Based on the data presented here and elsewhere,
we discuss possible reasons (and solutions) for this controversy and
propose how brain stimulation techniques can help to clarify the role
of oscillatory phase entrainment for the comprehension of speech
sounds.

Symposium Session 7
DRIVING THE BRAIN TO UNDERSTAND COGNITION
Tuesday, March 28, 10:00 am - Noon, Bayview
Chair: Jim Herring, Donders Institute - Centre for Cognitive
Neuroimaging
Speakers: Vincenzo Romei, Flavio Frohlich, Christian Keitel,
Anne Kösem, Jim D. Herring
Neuronal oscillations have long been studied for their role in
coordinating neuronal activity supporting cognitive processing.
Particular frequency bands have been associated with specific
functions such as the alpha band in top-down allocation of
computational resources, theta band oscillations in memory and
speech, and gamma-band oscillations in bottom-up stimulus
processing. To study the causal role of these oscillations in cognition
recent attempts have been made to drive the brain using various
techniques including sensory stimulation and non-invasive brain
stimulation techniques such as transcranial alternating current
stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. With these
techniques it is in principle possible to externally ‘entrain’ endogenous
oscillations and study the effects on brain and behavior. An important
role has been shown for both amplitude and phase of oscillations in
different bands. This symposium will present pioneering research
studying the role of neuronal oscillations in cognition using state-ofthe-art techniques to drive the endogenous rhythms of the brain. The
symposium aims to increase insight on the functional role of neuronal
oscillations in cognition and hopes to showcase developments aimed
at elucidating the causal role of oscillations.

2017 Annual Meeting

TALK 1: SHAPING BRAIN WAVES: AN INFORMATION-BASED
APPROACH
Vincenzo Romei1; 1University of Essex (UK)
Noninvasive Transcranial Brain Stimulation (NTBS) techniques have
prompted a paradigm shift in the study of brain oscillatory functions in
human behaviour from a correlational to a causative approach.
Mimicking endogenous brain oscillations through tACS or rhythmic
TMS has allowed shaping both the amplitude and phase components
of the targeted oscillation, when the frequency of stimulation matches
the endogenous oscillatory frequency, ultimately impacting behaviour.
Here I will show how information-based approaches of NTBS to the
study of brain oscillations can further our understanding of their
functional relevance by systematically manipulating a third component
kept constant in previous research: i.e. the endogenous frequency
itself. Interindividual variability within a frequency band can account for
interindividual variability in perceptual and cognitive processes. For
example the length of the occipital alpha cycle (range: 8-12Hz)
predicts the size of the temporal binding window determining the flashbeep illusion: the slower the alpha cycle, the bigger the temporal
binding window. As another example, the length of the parietal theta
cycle (range: 4-7Hz) predicts the amount of items successfully held in
spatial working memory: the slower the theta cycle, the better the
working memory capacity. By externally imposing slightly slower or
faster frequencies than the endogenous frequency I will show that we
can shape behaviour in expected directions. Finally, I will show that
information-based approaches of NTBS testing functional connectivity
between interconnected areas can be implemented to manipulate
long-range, inter-areal oscillatory activity and causally assess their
function, through the use of a novel cortico-cortical-paired associative
stimulation protocol.

clinical trials. Our computational stimulations provide support for the
presence of entrainment and resonance as the main mechanism of
tACS and demonstrate the pronounced state-dependence of the
response profile, linking the state of the thalamocortical system to the
response to tACS. We then demonstrate how alpha oscillations are
modulated by tACS in the ferret, an intermediate model species, which
exhibits pronounced alpha rhythms in the dark in absence of visual
input. Finally, we will give an update on target engagement of thalamocortical oscillations in human participants, with particular focus on our
recently developed feedback tACS for the modulation of sleep spindles
and on our ongoing clinical trials of tACS for mood disorders.
TALK 3: DRIVING VISUAL BRAIN RHYTHMS THROUGH
DYNAMIC SENSORY STIMULATION
Christian Keitel1; 1University of Glasgow
From the earliest days of recording Human brain activity, researchers
have been fascinated by the possibility of driving brain rhythms
externally by means of dynamic visual stimulation. This approach has
since inspired diverse lines of research into the neural mechanisms
underlying visual perception and its modulation by cognitive functions,
such as attention. Here, I will go through a selection of studies
following a trajectory from using simplistic, periodic rhythmic flickering
lights up to complex, quasi-periodic more naturalistic stimuli that our
visual system typically encounters. This compilation will highlight
commonalities between the different types of stimulation in probing
cortical processing of dynamic visual input. Further, it will serve to
demonstrate what we can gain by exploring the dynamic range of
visual stimuli beyond strictly periodic cases. Ultimately, these findings
will be discussed in the light of the idea that stimulus-driven brain
rhythms involve entrainment of endogenous brain rhythms.

Netherlands

Cortical oscillations, rhythmic activity patterns in cortex, have recently
emerged as a promising target for non-invasive brain stimulation. In
particular, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applies a
weak, sine-wave electric current to the scalp to modulate endogenous
cortical oscillations. Early studies point to successful target
engagement in terms of modulation of activity patterns and associated
cognitive functions. Yet, the field has reached a crossroad since the
number of electrophysiological studies has continued to be vastly
outnumbered by behavioral studies that do not directly demonstrate
target engagement. Several additional issues have emerged: statedependence of stimulation effects, lack of placebo-controlled doubleblind studies, and finally continued uncertainty about the mechanisms
of action. Here, we will give an update on our efforts to elucidate the
mechanisms of action and applications of tACS by combining
computer simulations, animal studies, and human studies, including

Low-frequency neural entrainment to speech is hypothesized to have
a causal role in the parsing of the speech signal into relevant linguistic
constituents. In this MEG experiment, we aimed at manipulating the
entrainment of oscillations in auditory cortex to test its direct
consequences on speech perception. We departed from the
hypothesis that neural entrainment reflects temporal predictions: the
brain would internalize the rhythms of preceding signals to process the
ongoing sensory input. Hence, ongoing neural oscillatory activity could
be manipulated by changing the dynamics of past sensory stimulation.
Using speech sentences that suddenly increased or decreased in rate,
we thus investigated if neural entrainment to past speech lasts after
the speech rate changes, and if persisting neural entrainment
influences speech perception. The beginning of the sentence was

either presented at a fast or a slow speech rate, while the last three
words (target window) were displayed at an intermediate rate across
trials. Participants were asked to report the perception of the last word
of the sentence, which contained an ambiguous vowel. The results
show that neural entrainment lasted after rhythmic stimulation: during
the target window, we observed oscillatory activity that corresponded
in frequency to the preceding speech rate. The persisting neural
entrainment correlated with speech perceptual biases: participants
who showed stronger persisting neural entrainment were more
influenced by the past speech rate in their perception of the last word.
These findings provide empirical support for oscillatory models of
speech processing, suggesting that neural oscillations actively
modulate speech comprehension.
TALK 5: ATTENTIONAL MODULATION OF EXTERNALLY
DRIVEN ALPHA OSCILLATIONS
Jim D. Herring1; 1Donders Institute, Nijmegen, The Netherlands
Alpha oscillations have been proposed to be involved in the allocation
of neuro-computational resources. While these oscillations are
typically generated endogenously, they can also by elicited by external
stimulation in which the brain responds with ‘ringing’ at ~10 Hz.
Examples are TMS-locked responses (Rosanova et al., 2009) and
‘perceptual echoes’ (VanRullen et al. 2012). It is unclear whether these
are resulting from evoking endogenous oscillations or whether they
result from evoked responses (ERFs/ERPs). We hypothesize that if
the oscillatory responses decrease with attention they reflect
endogenous alpha oscillations, whereas if they increase with attention
they reflect evoked responses. In a combined TMS-EEG study we
show that a single pulse of TMS elicits an alpha-like response.
Importantly, this response is modulated by top-down visual attention
similarly to endogenous alpha oscillations: the magnitude of the
response increases with a decrease in visual attention. Furthermore,
the attentional effect is proportional to the subject’s ability to modulate
their endogenous alpha activity with attention. In a second MEG study,
we induced so-called 10 Hz ‘perceptual echoes’ in visual cortex by
applying broadband visual stimulation. The perceptual echoes can be
thought of as impulse response functions of the brain to changing
visual input. Our key finding was that perceptual echoes increased with
low visual attention. Both studies suggest that endogenous and
externally driven alpha oscillations are functionally similar mechanism
and thus likely to share the same mechanism. As such, alpha
oscillations are likely to play a key role for the temporal coordination of
neuronal firing not only during rest but also during processing of
external stimuli.

DECIDING HOW TO DECIDE: UNDERSTANDING WHEN
AND WHY THE BRAIN ALLOCATES COMPUTATIONAL
RESOURCES TO GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR
Tuesday, March 28, 10:00 am - Noon, Ballroom A
Chair: Ross Otto, McGill University
Speakers: Hanneke den Ouden, Anne Collins, Sam Gershman,
Amitai Shenhav, Ross Otto
Everyday experiences are defined by decisions, from deciding what to
eat for lunch to making career choices, but not all of our decisions
come about the same way: some decisions are made with effort and
are slow, while other decisions are easier and made quickly. While the
question when and why an individual decides to expend—or
withhold—cognitive effort in the service goal-directed behavior has
been the topic of considerable interest to cognitive neuroscientists, a
spate of computationally-informed approaches are beginning to yield
critical leverage in understanding how the human brain solves this
problem. This symposium will spotlight the work of five emerging
researchers taking complementary approaches to understanding this
question. Anne Collins will explore how the interplay between effortful
working-memory based systems and more primitive reinforcementlearning systems unfolds in the brain. Sam Gershman will use a
neurocomputational model to show how the brain selects between
reinforcement learning processes on the basis of prediction error
signalling. Hanneke den Ouden will explore how heuristic responding
may be driven by biased instrumental learning. Amitai Shenhav will
present a unified theory of anterior cingulate function based on costbenefit principles of cognitive effort. Finally, Ross Otto will reveal how
the cost of time, formalized by reinforcement learning, directs our
exertion of cognitively effortful processes. Together, these talks
present cutting-edge perspectives on how the brain allocates
processing resources in the service of maximizing rewards, across
diverse behavioural repertoires.
TALK 1: MOTIVATIONAL BIASES IN LEARNING AND CHOICE
Hanneke den Ouden1, Jennifer Swart1; 1Donders Institute for
Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, Netherlands
Pavlovian conditioning is the most primitive and computationally
parsimonious form of learning. Pavlovian responses may help reduce
computational load by shaping our actions in an evolutionarily
hardwired manner. Instrumental learning systems, in contrast, allow
organisms to adaptively learn which actions are good in specific
environments. Pavlovian and instrumental systems are often
presented as a dichotomy, respectively driving cue-based motivational
biases versus adaptive ‘rational’ choice. For example, a number of
recent studies on motivational biases of action (e.g. appetitive
activation / aversive inhibition) have interpreted these responses in
terms of Pavlovian response biases. An alternative possibility is that
adaptive systems have evolved to take into account prior likelihoods

2017 Annual Meeting

of certain response-outcome associations, and learn these
preferentially to minimize computational expenses. Thus, motivational
biases of behavioural activation may additionally arise from biased
instrumental learning. Such a learning bias would provide a cognitively
efficient mechanism for rapid learning of likely action-outcome
associations whilst protecting against learning spurious associations.
We will present work that (i) probes whether these biases in
instrumental
learning
subserve
the
well-established
reward/punishment biases of motivated action or inaction, and (ii)
probe the pharmaco-computational mechanisms that subserve these
biases, using a combination of EEG, psychopharmacology and
computational modelling of behaviour.
TALK 2: WORKING MEMORY CONTRIBUTES TO
REINFORCEMENT LEARNING COMPUTATIONS
Anne Collins1; 1University of California, Berkeley
When learning to make choices in different situations, humans can use
multiple strategies in parallel, including working memory and
reinforcement learning. Working memory allows very fast learning, but
is cognitively effortful as well as limited in how much information can
be retained, and for how long. Reinforcement learning has broader
scope, but is more incremental and slower. Here, we investigate
whether these two processes are independent in their computations
and simply compete for choice, or if they interact at a deeper level. In
multiple independent games, participants learned to select actions for
varying numbers of new stimuli. When learning a low number of
associations, performance was near optimal, indicating efficient use of
working memory. With increasing number of associations to learn,
performance gradually decayed to a more incremental learning profile,
as expected from a greater contribution of slower reinforcement
learning mechanisms when working memory contribution became less
reliable and more costly. We will show evidence from fMRI, EEG and
behavioral studies that the working memory process influences
reinforcement learning computations. Specifically, we find that the
update of estimated values with reward prediction errors was
surprisingly weakened in the easier conditions where performance
was best. We will use computational modeling to show that this is
compatible with a competitive or cooperative interaction between
working memory and reinforcement learning, but not with a competing
independent processes theory. Preliminary evidence supports a
cooperative hypothesis, whereby working memory contributes
expectations to the computation of the reward prediction error.

(predictions change instantaneously whenever the cognitive map
changes) but computationally expensive (many simulations are
required to compute a value). By contrast, model-free approaches
directly store cached value estimates in a look-up table, making
valuation fast but inflexible (cached values will not change without
additional experience in the task). I describe a computational approach
to arbitration between the two approaches: a hypothetical metacontroller uses a policy gradient algorithm to allocate based on reward
prediction errors. Behavioral and neural data support this architecture,
suggesting a pivotal role for dopaminergic prediction error signaling in
meta-control. In particular, we find that the meta-control model can
predict, on a trial-by-trial basis, which system controls behavior, and
these trial-by-trial changes are reflected in the striatal prediction error
signal measured using fMRI. When the model-based system is in
control of behavior, the prediction error signal is based on a modelbased value signal, consistent with our model predictions.

EFFORT

Cognitive control is known to be effortful, yet little is known about how
we determine how that effort gets allocated. I will describe recent
theoretical and empirical work aimed at understanding this process
through the lens of value-based decision-making, focusing on our
proposal that individuals choose how much and what kind of control to
allocate according to the predicted benefits (e.g., reward likelihood)
and the costs associated with increased effort exertion. These
combine to determine what we refer to as the Expected Value of
Control (EVC). The EVC framework accounts for interactions between
incentives, cognitive performance, and task choice observed in
behavioral performance. It also offers a more comprehensive account
of dorsal anterior cingulate function, and a common explanation for its
purported roles in the motivation, decision-making, and cognitive
control literatures. In particular, the theory suggests that dACC
integrates information relevant to the costs and benefits of control
allocation (including signals of reward and cognitive demand), and
signals to downstream regions the allocation that maximizes EVC,
enabling this control to be exerted. The framework also makes contact
with approaches from computer science for deciding how to decide
between computationally demanding strategies (referred to as rational
metareasoning). This work provides a path towards understanding
why we may not always choose to make the effort demanded by our
academic, work, or social environment, and how variability in these
circuits will lead to maladaptive allocation of cognitive control in
particular clinical populations.

TALK 5: THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF TIME MODULATES
COGNITIVE EFFORT EXPENDITURE
Ross Otto1, Nathaniel Daw2; 1McGill University, 2Princeton
University
A spate of recent work demonstrates that humans seek to avoid the
expenditure of cognitive effort, much like physical effort or economic
resources. Less is clear, however, about the circumstances dictating
how and when people decide to expend cognitive effort. Here we adopt
a popular theory of opportunity costs and response vigor and to
elucidate this question. This account, grounded in Reinforcement
Learning, formalizes a trade-off between two costs: the harder work
assumed necessary to emit faster actions and the opportunity cost
inherent in acting more slowly (i.e., the delay that results to the next
reward and subsequent rewards). Recent work reveals that the
opportunity cost of time—operationalized as the average reward rate
per unit time, theorized to be signaled by tonic dopamine levels,
modulates the speed with which a person responds in a simple
discrimination tasks. We extend this framework to cognitive effort in a
diverse range of cognitive tasks, for which 1) the amount of cognitive
effort demanded from the task varies from trial to trial and 2) the
expenditure of cognitive effort holds measureable consequences in
terms of accuracy and response time. In the domains of cognitive
control, perceptual decision-making, and task-switching, we found that
subjects tuned their response speeds in accordance with the
experienced average reward rate: when the opportunity cost of time
was high, subjects responded more quickly. That is, expenditure of
cognitive effort appeared to be modulated by the opportunity cost of
time. Further, and consistent with our account, the strength of this
modulation covaried with individual differences in efficacy of cognitive
control, operationalized as response slowing on incongruent trials.
Taken together, our results provide a cost-benefit informed
examination of the circumstances dictating how and when people
expend cognitive effort.

MEMORY NEUROMODULATION: HOW DO DIFFERENT
STATES OF LEARNING INFLUENCE EPISODIC MEMORY?
Tuesday, March 28, 10:00 am - Noon, Ballroom B/C
Chair: Vishnu Murty, University of Pittsburgh
Speakers: Katherine Duncan, Vishnu Murty, Matthias Gruber,
Joel Voss, Mara Mather
Memories are not veridical; rather an individual’s goals, desires, and
affect can influence how they store representations of their
environment in long-term memory. To fully understand the selectivity
of memory, it is critical to understand how these different internal
states of learning modulate episodic memory. A large body of animal
research has detailed a variety of neuromodulatory processes
influencing hippocampal neurophysiology, providing a theoretical
framework to understand how these states of learning could influence
40

human memory. This symposium features emerging research
characterizing how a variety of different states of learning—including
novelty, motivation, curiosity, exploration, and arousal—influence how
the brain encodes and stabilizes episodic memories. First, Katherine
Duncan will present her work characterizing the lingering effect of
novelty on biasing mnemonic processes of pattern
completion/separation in a manner consistent with cholinergic
modulation. Second, Vishnu Murty will present his work demonstrating
how motivation, and associated engagement of mesolimbic systems,
enhances episodic memory at multiple timescales to support adaptive
behavior. Third, Mathias Gruber will present his work investigating how
both intrinsic and extrinsic states of motivation enhance episodic
memory by facilitating interactions between the dopaminergic midbrain
and hippocampus both during and after encoding. Fourth, Joel Voss
will present his research showing how states of exploration change
individuals learning strategies as well as the structure of memory.
Finally, Mara Mather will present recent research detailing how arousal
biases memory towards salient information, particularly negative
information, in a manner consistent with noradrenergic modulation.
TALK 1: THE LINGERING INFLUENCE OF NOVELTY SHAPES
FUNDAMENTAL MEMORY PROCESSES.
Katherine Duncan1; 1University of Toronto
Detecting novelty triggers a cascade of neuromodulatory action, which
can persistently influence neurons for seconds or even minutes. Given
the numerous demonstrations of novelty’s influence at a physiological
level, we know surprisingly little about the lingering consequences that
novelty detection has on the human mnemonic operations supported
by these physiological processes. Cholinergic modulation of the
hippocampus is particularly suited for shaping human memory. In
addition to influencing synaptic plasticity, cholinergic modulation may
regulate hippocampal network properties; novelty-induced high levels
of acetylcholine could push the hippocampus toward pattern
separation, preparing it to form new distinctive memories, whereas
familiarity-induced low levels could pull the hippocampus towards
pattern completion, preparing it to retrieve associations. Importantly,
cholinergic modulation persists for seconds, suggesting that recent
novelty or familiarity can shape subsequent mnemonic processing.
Here, I present a series of behavioural experiments testing different
predictions generated by this cholinergic framework. In Experiment 1,
we demonstrate that recent exposure to novelty as compared to
familiarity improves people’s ability to detect subtle changes, a
hallmark of pattern separation (Duncan et al., 2012). In Experiment 2,
we demonstrate that recent familiarity as compared to novelty
improves people’s ability to recall associations, a hallmark of pattern
completion (Patil & Duncan, under review). In both studies, the
influence of novelty and familiarity decayed over seconds, in line with
cholinergic modulation. In Experiment 3, we show that these robust
mnemonic biases influence how people use memory to make
decisions (Duncan & Shohamy, in press).

TALK 2: MOTIVATION FACILITATES MEMORY AT MULTIPLE
TIMESCALES IN SERVICE OF ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR.
Vishnu Murty1; 1University of Pittsburgh
As we navigate through the world, we are inundated with immense
amounts of information—too much information to veridically encode
into long-term memory. Rather than attempt to encode all of this
information, memory is selective. Information that is most relevant to
achieving future goals is prioritized in long-term memory. In my talk, I
will present a series of behavioral and neuroimaging studies that
characterize how motivation facilitates memory encoding for goalrelevant information. I will show how motivational states support
memory not only for items directly associated with reward but also for
neutral items presented in rewarding contexts. Also, I will present
emerging behavioral data showing that reward can retroactively
enhance memory for information that is later learned to be reward
relevant. Finally, I will present 2 fMRI studies unpacking potential
mechanisms supporting these memory enhancements including
facilitation of hippocampal-dependent processes during encoding, and
hippocampal-cortical interactions during periods of post-encoding rest.
Together, these studies support a model in which individuals tailor their
memories of the environment depending on their goal states, which
provides a foundation of information to support future adaptive
behavior in similar environments.
TALK 3: STATES OF REWARD AND CURIOSITY PRIORITIZE
LEARNING AND POST-LEARNING DYNAMICS
Matthias Gruber1; 1Cardiff University
An adaptive memory system prioritizes salient over less salient
information. Several studies have shown how rewards influence
learning of specific stimuli, but little is known about how motivational
states affect learning and retention. In my talk, I will review not only
how states of extrinsic motivation (via monetary incentives) but also
how states of intrinsic motivation (via curiosity) affect learning. I will
present evidence from a series of fMRI and EEG studies that
demonstrate how states of high motivation (via curiosity or reward)
prioritize learning and memory consolidation for motivationally relevant
but also incidental information. Our results show that the substantia
nigra/ventral tegmental area complex and the hippocampus play a
critical role in prioritizing retention of memories learned during states
of high motivation both during encoding and during post-learning rest.
The findings highlight the crucial role of how motivational states
modulate learning and consolidation mechanisms.
TALK 4: EXPLORATION MODULATES HIPPOCAMPALCORTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO EPISODIC LEARNING
Joel Voss1; 1Northwestern University
Exploratory behaviors during learning determine what is studied and
when. Exploration should therefore: (1) determine the structured
content of resultant memory representations, and (2) allow learning to

Symposium Sessions

be optimized based on goals and strategies expressed during
exploration. I will describe a collection of experiments that uses wellcontrolled manipulations of exploration to demonstrate both of these
principles and to identify neurocognitive mechanisms for exploration’s
influence on learning and memory. In these experiments, information
that was sampled via active exploration provided structure to memory,
such that the content of multi-part episodic memories was organized
around the actively explored information. Furthermore, subjects
exhibited identifiable visual-sampling strategies that enhanced later
memory, demonstrating the optimization of learning via exploration.
These phenomena suggest that exploration involves memoryattention iterative interactions, by which the memory representation
that evolves continuously over the course of exploration is repeatedly
queried in order to strategically guide moment-to-moment visual
sampling behavior. Across a wide range of experimental settings,
neuroimaging and lesion-deficit evidence suggest that the
hippocampus is necessary for this strategic memory-attention
dialogue, which is supported by hippocampal interactions with
distributed prefrontal and parietal regions. Furthermore, by
manipulating the timecourse of exploration, separate contributions
from hippocampus versus fronto-parietal network regions were
dissociated. Hippocampal-dependent memory is thus a dynamic
process, rather than a static record of experience. These findings show
how the exploration state is a fundamental modulator of hippocampalcortical interactions that build memories, and pinpoint unique
exploration-related cognitive operations performed by hippocampus
versus distributed cortical networks.
TALK 5: A POTENTIAL ROLE FOR NOREPINEPHRINE HOT
SPOTS IN LONG-TERM MEMORY FOR NEGATIVE STIMULI.
Mara Mather1, Shawn Nielsen1, Michiko Sakaki2, Jasmine Raw2;
1University of Sourthern California, 2University of Reading
Arousal makes salient or important stimuli stand out even more while
everything else fades in the background. The locus coeruleusnorepinephrine (LC-NE) system is activated during physiologically
arousing situations and plays a key role in increasing the gain on
mental representations. This amplification of gain may be especially
adaptive in dangerous situations, when it can be critical to focus on
threatening stimuli. In addition, negative stimuli tend to be more salient
than positive stimuli across a broad range of situations and contexts.
In this series of behavioral and neuroimaging studies, we tested the
hypothesis that arousal-induced LC activity enhances encoding of
negative stimuli more than positive or neutral stimuli. To increase tonic
arousal, we had participants either squeeze a handgrip as hard as they
could several times, or just rest their hand around a water bottle before
viewing a series of pictures. The handgrip manipulation increased
pupil dilation, suggesting that it reliably increased the LC activity and
NE levels. In addition, the handgrip manipulation enhanced
subsequent memory for the negative stimuli compared with the
positive and neutral stimuli. Furthermore, these effects were stronger

in women in low ovarian hormone states (either on hormone
contraception or during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle),
consistent with effects of estrogen on the noradrenergic system. These
findings indicate that higher tonic levels LC-NE activation support an
encoding advantage for negative stimuli—a bias that may be adaptive
in many high stakes situations but may lead to disadvantages in
situations where positive stimuli are informative.

action-oriented view of cognition.

Keith E. Stanovich, Richard F. West,
and Maggie E. Toplak
“A significant advance in the psychology
of rationality. It presents the best analysis
of cognitive errors in the scientific literature
and makes a compelling case for measuring
rationality independently of intelligence.”
—Daniel Kahneman, Princeton University,
winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics
Hardcover | $39 | £32.95

The Limits of Moral Enhancement
Harris Wiseman
“Wiseman injects a much-needed measure
of scientific and political reality into one of
the hottest debates in applied ethics today.
The distinctions he draws in the course of
his wide-ranging defense of human agency
against reductionism may just succeed in
rescuing the idea of moral enhancement
from its staunchest advocates.”

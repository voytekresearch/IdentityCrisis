Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

George A. Miller Prize

17th Annual George A. Miller Prize
in Cognitive Neuroscience
Sunday, April 3, 3:00 - 4:00 pm, Grand Ballroom
Reception to follow, 4:00 - 5:00 pm,
Grand Ballroom Foyer & Market Street Foyer
The Cognitive Neuroscience Society is pleased to
announce the recipient of the 2011 George A. Miller Prize
in Cognitive Neuroscience:

Dr. Mortimer Mishkin
National Institute of Mental Health
The George A. Miller Prize in Cognitive Neuroscience was
established in 1995 by the Cognitive Neuroscience Society
and the James S. McDonnell Foundation to honor the
career contributions of George A. Miller to cognitive neuroscience. The first 10 years of the prize were funded by
generous support from the James S. McDonnell Foundation.
The prize is awarded to the nominee whose career is characterized by distinguished and sustained scholarship and
research at the cutting-edge of cognitive neuroscience.
Extraordinary innovation and high impact on international scientific thinking should be a hallmark of the recipient's work.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Each year a call for nominations for the George A. Miller
Prize is made to the membership of the society. The recipient is selected by a committee with the approval of the
society. The prize winner attends the annual meeting of
the Cognitive Neuroscience Society and delivers the
George A. Miller Lecture.
Speech and auditory memory: How deep are their
connections?
That speech and auditory memory may be deeply connected is suggested by two recent findings. The first is the
momentous discovery of the FOXP2 gene, essential for
oromotor articulation, an ability that appears to have
evolved within the hominid line in just the last 300,000
years. The second finding, less momentous but more puzzling, is that monkeys (and dogs!) appear to be unable to
store auditory stimuli in long-term memory, even though
they are easily able to do so with visual and tactile stimuli,
and even though they can retain auditory stimuli for the
limited period of working memory. While seemingly
unrelated, these two pieces of evidence in combination
suggest the following, admittedly radical, proposal.
Because natural acoustic stimuli fluctuate rapidly in time,
their neural representations, unlike those of stationary
sensory stimuli, cannot be packaged for long-term storage
in the sensory system alone. Rather, such packaging
requires the aid of the motor system, which is uniquely
organized to chain-link rapid sequences. Humans have a
set of ‘recently’ evolved or enlarged and enhanced temporo-frontal interconnections – the arcuate fasciculi – that
automatically transform the temporally fluctuating acoustic sequence into a subvocal oromotor sequence This integrated acoustic-oromotor sequence serves as the stored
representation of the sound. A corollary of this proposal is
that a fluctuating sound can be stored in long-term memory only to the extent that it can be reproduced or mimicked by the oromotor system. Evidence will be presented
that supports this corollary and, consequently, supports
the notion that speech and auditory memory may be so
critically dependent upon the other that they could only
evolve together.

Young Investigator Award

The Young Investigator Award in Cognitive Neuroscience
recognizes outstanding contributions by scientists early in
their careers. Two awardees are named each year and are
honored at the annual meeting (immediately before the
George A. Miller Award). Each winner received a $500
award and gives a 30-minute talk at the meeting.

The Influences of Emotional Arousal and
Valence on Episodic Memory

The Cognitive Neuroscience Society is pleased to present
this year’s recipients of the Young Investigator Award.

Dimensional models of emotion typically classify experiences based upon their arousal and valence. A large body
of research has confirmed the role that arousal plays in
guiding emotional memory, but it has been less clear to
what extent valence influences the way in which an emotional experience is remembered. In this talk, I will
present evidence that arousal and valence can each influence the types of details remembered about an experience,
including neuroimaging evidence to suggest that many of
the effects of arousal and valence relate to the processes
engaged as an experience is initially encoded into memory.

Interactions Between Frontal Cortex and
Basal Ganglia in Volitional Control
Michael J. Frank, Ph.D., Brown University
Monday, April 4, 9:00 - 9:40 am, Grand Ballroom A
The frontal cortex and basal ganglia interact intimately to
support distinct aspects of motivated behavior, from
motor to cognitive control. The dynamics of this circuitry
have been explored via a series of inter-related computational models at multiple levels of description (neural to
algorithmic). I will discuss recent attempts to combine
these levels of modeling to generate and test predictions
using a variety of cognitive neuroscience methods.
Michael J. Frank is Assistant Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic &
Psychological Sciences in the
Brown Institute for Brain Science
at Brown University, where he
directs the Laboratory for Neural
Computation and Cognition. He
received his PhD in Neuroscience
and Psychology in 2004 at the
University of Colorado. His
research combines computational
models with experiments to
examine mechanisms of learning, decision making, working memory and inhibitory control in
basal ganglia and frontal cortex. Models are tested and refined
with a variety of methods, including patient populations, pharmacological manipulation, deep brain stimulation, electroencephalography, and genetics.

Elizabeth Kensinger, Ph.D., Boston College
Tuesday, April 5, 9:00 - 9:40 am, Grand Ballroom A

Elizabeth A. Kensinger is Associate Professor of Psychology at
Boston College. She received her
Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT
in 2003 and joined the faculty of
Boston College in 2006 after completing a postdoctoral fellowship
in the Dept. of Radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and
the Dept. of Psychology at Harvard University. Her research
examines how the emotional content of information affects the
processes that college-age and older adults use to remember
information. She has co-authored over 70 articles and book chapters focusing on emotion and memory processes and how those
processes change with aging, and she authored a book, Emotional Memory Across the Adult Lifespan, published with Psychology Press in 2009. Her research has been supported by
grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, the National
Institute on Aging, the National Science Foundation, the Dana
Foundation, the Searle Scholars Program, and the American Federation for Aging Research.

Symposium Session 1
INGREDIENTS OF THE MIND: A PSYCHOLOGICAL
CONSTRUCTIONIST APPROACH TO COGNITIVE
NEUROSCIENCE
Sunday, April 3, 10:00 am - 12:00 pm, Grand Ballroom A
Chair: Kristen Lindquist, Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital;
Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging
Co-Chair: Lisa Feldman Barrett, Northeastern University; Harvard Medical
School; Massachusetts General Hospital; Martinos Center for Biomedical
Imaging
Speakers: Kristen Lindquist, Tor Wager, William Cunningham, Alexandra
Touroutoglou
Cognitive neuroscience has traditionally sought the distinct neural bases
of psychological categories like “thought,” “attention,” “memory” and
“emotion.” Yet growing evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying these psychological categories are not as distinct as once thought.
According to a psychological constructionist framework, complex mental categories are phenomena constructed from more basic psychological
ingredients that correspond to functional networks in the brain. In this
symposium, we will explore how a psychological constructionist
approach to the mind can inform cognitive neuroscience. The four talks
presented will be empirical examples of a psychological construction
approach. Kristen Lindquist will present meta-analytic data demonstrating that emotion experiences and perceptions are comprised of activity
in functional groupings associated with affect, categorization, language
and executive attention. Next, Tor Wager will present findings demonstrating that the same basic brain system is involved in functions central
to the “self,” pain, and negative emotion. William Cunningham will next
demonstrate how amygdala activity is dynamically shaped by the goals
of a perceiver. Finally, Alexandra Touroutoglou will next present evidence demonstrating that both attention and emotion experience have a
common ingredient in the anterior insula.

PSYCHOLOGICAL INGREDIENTS IN EMOTION: FINDINGS FROM A METAANALYTIC REVIEW OF THE NEUROIMAGING LITERATURE Kristen

Lindquist1,2, Tor Wager3, Hedy Kober4, Eliza Bliss-Moreau5, Lisa Feldman
Barrett6,2; 1Harvard University, 2Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts
General Hospital/Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, 3University of
Colorado, Boulder, 4Yale University School of Medicine, 5University of
California, Davis, 6Northeastern University — Researchers have wondered
how the brain creates mental states like emotions since the early days of
psychological science. According to psychological constructionist views
of emotion, the experience and perception of discrete emotion categories
(anger, sadness, fear, etc.) emerge from the interplay of brain networks
corresponding to general psychological ingredients like affect, language,
categorization and executive attention. These ingredients are involved in
constructing all mental states, not just emotions. This hypothesis stands

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

in contrast to the hypothesis that the experience and perception of discrete emotion categories map consistently and specifically to increased
activity in distinct brain regions (e.g., fear in the amygdala). In this talk, I
will present findings from a recent meta-analytic summary of the human
neuroimaging literature on emotion (summarizing studies published
between 1993-2007). Overall, we found that brain regions involved in
basic psychological processes like the instantiation of affective states, categorization of sensations, language and executive attention were active
across discrete emotion experience and perception. Moreover, increases
in activity in certain brain areas (e.g., the amygdala) did not correspond
consistently or specifically to any emotion category (e.g., fear). The
implications of these findings for a psychological constructionist view of
emotion (and of the mind more generally) are discussed.

BRAIN-BODY COMMUNICATION IN STRESS AND PAIN: A VIEW FROM
NEUROIMAGING Tor Wager1; 1University of Colorado, Boulder — Whereas
some cognitive scientists once thought of emotion as merely a "volume
knob," the last 15 years have seen a resurgence in quantitative work on
affective processes and their effects on behavior, perception, action, and
physical and mental disorders. This research provides new insight into
the brain representations of pain, pleasure, and affective/motivational
context. These processes, and the brain circuits that underlie them are
critical for healthy social and emotional functioning and are likely to
play a central role in a variety of mental health disorders. In the first part
of the talk, I draw on meta-analytic evidence to describe a vertically integrated, functional system that spans the medial prefrontal cortex, subcortical telencephalon, and brainstem. I will argue that this system is
intimately involved in a number of functions central to the "self," including the representation of positive and negative outcomes, autobiographical memory, expectations about the future, and context-driven
regulation of the autonomic and endocrine systems. In the second part of
the talk, I present examples from recent functional neuroimaging studies
that demonstrate a role for this system in the context-based regulation of
pain, stress, and negative emotion by abstract contextual information.
These studies suggest that medial prefrontal-brainstem pathways mediate placebo effects in pain, mental stress-induced changes in autonomic
physiology, and successful self-generated regulation of emotion. These
studies demonstrate that healthy function in circuits is likely to be
important for a variety of mental health disorders and physical disorders
with a neurogenic component.

MOTIVATIONAL SALIENCE: GOALS SHAPE AMYGDALA ACTIVATION

William Cunningham1; 1The Ohio State University — Recent research and theory has highlighted the dynamic nature of amygdala activation. Rather
than simply being sensitive to a few limited stimulus categories (i.e.,
fear), amygdala activation appears to be dependent on the goals of the
perceiver. Two studies provide evidence that the relation between
valence and amygdala activity is dynamically modulated by evaluative
goals. In the first, participants evaluated the positive, negative, or overall
(positive+negative) aspects of famous people during fMRI scanning.
When participants provided overall evaluations, both positive and negative names were associated with amygdala activation. When they evaluated positivity, positive names were associated with amygdala activity,

13

Symposium Sessions
and when they evaluated negativity, negative names were associated
with amygdala activity. In the second, the strategic means by which participants deal with threat were explored. Whereas Neuroticism-Volatility is proposed to be associated with the fight-flight-freeze system and a
sensitivity for any cues of negativity, Neuroticism-Withdrawal is proposed to be associated with the behavioral inhibition system and a generalized tendency toward passive avoidance. Participants were
presented with positive, negative, and neutral images and were required
to approach (move perceptually closer) or avoid (move perceptually farther away) stimuli in different blocks of trials. Participants higher in
Neuroticism-Volatility had increased amygdala activation to negative
stimuli (whether they were approached or avoided), whereas participants higher in Neuroticism-Withdrawal had increased amygdala activation to all approached stimuli. These data provide support for the
motivational salience hypothesis of amygdala function demonstrating
that both the ends and means of goal pursuit are important for constructing an amygdala response.

FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION WITHIN THE ANTERIOR INSULA
REVEALED BY INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY Alexandra

Touroutoglou1, Lisa Feldman Barrett2,1; 1Harvard Medical School/
Massachusetts General Hospital/Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging,
2Northeastern University — Task-related fMRI studies have suggested that
anterior insula is implicated in both executive attention and affective
experience. Specifically, the dorsal anterior insula is preferentially
involved in cognitive control, whereas the ventral anterior insula is preferentially involved in the subjective experience of emotion. An important question is whether, in the absence of task, spontaneous activity of
the anterior insula distinguishes the elementary ‘ingredients’ involved in
cognitive control and emotion. To address this question, we used resting
state functional connectivity analysis (18 young adults; mean age 22.09; 6
males) and examined the regions that are intrinsically correlated with
the dorsal and ventral subregions of the anterior insula. Results showed
that intrinsic blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal fluctuations within
the dorsal anterior insula region are significantly correlated with signal
fluctuations in frontal, parietal, and dorsal cingulate regions, as well as
in dorsal putamen and ventromedial thalamus. The ventral anterior
insula network, in contrast, is less extended than the dorsal anterior
insula network and comprises regions within the ventral cingulate,
medial orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, ventral striatum and dorsolateral
thalamus. Further, our data indicate that the magnitude of intrinsic connectivity within the dorsal and ventral anterior insula networks is differentially predicted by individual differences in cognitive control and
affective experience, respectively. These findings suggest that anterior
insula is intrinsically connected to functionally dissociated cortical and
subcortical regions involved in executive attention and affect. The implications of these findings for our understanding of the psychological
‘ingredients’ of mental processes are discussed.

Symposium Session 2
NEW PERSPECTIVES OF THE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS OF
THE ANGULAR GYRUS
Monday, April 4, 10:00 am - 12:00 pm, Grand Ballroom A
Chair: Miriam Rosenberg-Lee, Stanford University
Co-Chair: Vinod Menon, Stanford University
Speakers: Vinod Menon, Jeffrey Binder, Roland Grabner, Roberto Cabeza
Functional imaging studies have highlighted the involvement of the
angular gyrus (AG) in language, memory, attention and math cognition.
Yet each domain ascribes a different function to this region including,
speech comprehension, episodic memory retrieval, bottom-up attention,
and verbally-mediated retrieval of math facts. Complicating this already
busy landscape is the consistent finding that many task-related differences in the AG result from differences in deactivation, rather than acti-

14

vation. Indeed, the AG has been identified as the lateral node of the
default mode network, a set of regions with tightly coupled activity at
rest, which deactivate during cognitively demanding tasks. This symposium presents current research focused on understanding the cognitive
functions of the AG in light of both activation and deactivation, as well
as understanding its structural and functional connectivity. In language,
the AG deactivates during the processing of nonsense sentences, but
activates above resting baseline late in the processing of semantically
congruent sentences, suggesting its function in semantic processing. In
mathematics, confusion between operations induces above baseline
activity in an arithmetic verification task, suggesting the AG is not specifically involved in the verbal storage of math facts, but instead
involved in mapping between symbols and referents. In memory,
greater AG deactivation during encoding improves performance;
whereas, greater activation during retrieval is associated with better
memory, consistent with the attention to memory hypothesis. This symposium will foster dialogue between these perspectives and attempt to
define important open questions for future research into the cognitive
functions of the AG.
ABSTRACTS

STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN THE ANGULAR
GYRUS Vinod Menon1, Miriam Rosenberg-Lee1; 1Stanford University —
This presentation will discuss perspectives on the anatomy and connectivity of the angular gyrus (AG). One potential reason why multiple cognitive functions have been attributed to the AG is because its anatomy
and connectivity are poorly understood. We present an overview of the
anatomy of the human AG, in relation to its boundaries with the supramarginal gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, superior temporal cortex and anterior occipital cortex. We discuss the parcellation and nomenclature of
Brodmann’s area 39 (1909) and von Economo and Koskinas area PG
(1925), and highlight more recent work from the Julich group on cytoarchitectonic mapping of the AG into two distinct areas: a posterior (PGp)
and anterior (PGa). We examine functional heterogeneity of the AG during mathematical reasoning tasks and provide evidence for distinct activation and deactivation patterns in the PGp and PGa. We describe our
investigations structure-function relations in the AG using multimodal
brain imaging by combining resting-state fMRI connectivity with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Resting-state functional connectivity reveals
that the PGp is strongly coupled with several nodes of the default mode
network, including the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior
cingulate and the hippocampus. In contrast, the PGa is tightly coupled
with the inferior frontal gyrus and the caudate. Fiber tracking of DTI
data provided converging evidence for distinct patterns of PGa and PGa
connectivity. Our results point to heterogeneity in the structural and
functional connectivity of the AG, and provide a framework for understanding the complex patterns of activation and deactivation reported in
the AG.

THE ROLE OF ANGULAR GYRUS IN SEMANTIC PROCESSING Jeffrey
Binder1; 1Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA — Many studies have implicated the angular gyrus in aspects of semantic processing.
The AG shows stronger activation during semantic decision compared
to phonological decision tasks on words. In both reading and lexical
decision tasks, the AG shows stronger activation to words than to structurally matched pseudowords, and to concrete words relative to abstract
words. In sentence comprehension studies, the AG shows a late
increased response for sentences with coherent meaning compared to
sentences that cannot be semantically integrated. Retrieval and manipulation of conceptual knowledge are not processes restricted to artificial
language tasks, but are also core processes underlying planning, problem solving, and daydreaming, which are mental activities in which
humans engage by default when attentional resources are not otherwise
occupied. Thus, as with other components of the conceptual network,
the AG shows relatively greater activation during conscious "resting"
and passive states than during attentionally demanding, non-semantic

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Symposium Sessions
tasks. Anatomical characteristics of the AG are consistent with a role in
high-level conceptual processing. The AG is located at an intermediate
position between visual, somatosensory, and auditory sensory systems,
suggesting a role as a high-level convergence zone, and is strongly interconnected with other heteromodal regions in temporal and prefrontal
cortex, all of which have greatly expanded in the human relative to the
nonhuman primate brain. The AG proper should be distinguished from
cortex in the intraparietal sulcus, which forms the medial boundary of
the AG but has very different connectivity and is implicated in attention,
calculation, and other non-semantic functions.

THE ROLE OF THE AG IN MATHEMATICAL COGNITION Roland Grabner1,

Daniel Ansari2; 1Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zürich,
Switzerland, 2University of Western Ontario, London, Canada — The angular
gyrus (AG) has been implicated in mental arithmetic for several decades
but its functional significance is still far from being understood. Much
evidence has accumulated suggesting that it supports the retrieval of
arithmetic facts from memory, and that activation differences between
individuals of lower and higher mathematical competence reflect differential reliance on fact retrieval. Since the AG is part of the default mode
network (DMN), its specific role in number processing has been questioned. Observations of higher AG activity during fact retrieval compared to more difficult task conditions have been interpreted to be due
to the inverse relationship between DMN activity and task difficulty. In
this contribution, two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies are
presented challenging both accounts. The first study investigated the
neural correlates of the associative confusion effect in arithmetic, i.e., the
finding of lower performance in addition and multiplication verification
tasks when presented solutions are correct responses in the other operation. This study revealed higher AG activity in the more difficult confusion problems (e.g., “4+3=12”) compared to non-confusion problems
(e.g., “4+3=10”). In the second study, individuals of lower and higher
mathematical competence were found to differ in AG activity in a nonarithmetic task requiring the translation among multiple numerical representations. These results suggest that the function of the AG in mental
arithmetic goes beyond retrieval of arithmetic facts and cannot be
reduced to task difficulty effects. An alternative account of the functional
significance of the AG, the symbol-referent mapping hypothesis, is proposed.

THE ROLE OF ANGULAR AND SUPRAMARGINAL GYRI IN MEMORY
ENCODING AND RETRIEVAL Roberto Cabeza1; 1Duke University, Durham,
NC, USA — The contribution of parietal cortices to episodic memory is a
fascinating scientific puzzle. On the one hand, parietal lesions do not
normally yield severe episodic-memory deficits; on the other hand, parietal activations are seen frequently in functional neuroimaging studies of
episodic memory. To account for this evidence, we have proposed an
Attention to Memory (AtoM) model, which states ventral parietal cortex
(VPC) mediate bottom-up attention to memories or memory cues,
whereas dorsal parietal cortex (DPC) mediates top-down attention to
memory task goals. The AtoM model is consistent with available patient
and functional neuroimaging data, as well as with further functional
subdivisions within VPC and within DPC. Within VPC, there is evidence
that the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and the angular gyrus (AG) have
different anatomical connections, belong to different large-scale functional networks, and contribute differently to perception and memory
tasks. The AtoM model can account for these dissociations under the
assumption that they reflect different aspects of bottom-up attention.
This thesis will be supported with evidence from parietal patients and
functional neuroimaging studies of encoding and retrieval.

Symposium Session 3
THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF HUMAN CONSUMPTION:
INTEGRATING EVIDENCE ACROSS SPECIES AND
DOMAINS
Monday, April 4, 3:00 - 5:00 pm, Grand Ballroom A
Chair: Stephanie Preston, University of Michigan
Speakers: Morten L. Kringelbach, Brian Knutson, Stephanie D. Preston,
Antonio Rangel
Humans make hundreds of consumption decisions everyday, with significant consequences for themselves (e.g., healthy vs. unhealthy dietary
choices), others (e.g., donate to charity vs. consume), and the future (e.g.,
buy a hybrid vs. an SUV). A sizable body of behavioral evidence from
psychology and economics suggests that individuals struggle during
these choices to balance short- and long-term desires, often producing
suboptimal decisions for the self, society, and the environment. This
motivates a basic question in cognitive neuroscience: How does the brain
make basic consumption decisions, and why does it often fail to make
them optimally? This symposium showcases recent human functional
neuroimaging (fMRI) work, informed by animal neuroscience and
human clinical work, to address these questions. Morten Kringelbach
explains the role of consciousness in decisions about rewards, focusing
on differences among species and between fundamental (food and sex)
and higher-order (money, material goods) consummatory rewards.
Brian Knutson will discuss recent human neuroimaging work using
whole brain predictive analyses to understand the distinct roles of the
nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex in human decisions to
purchase desired goods. Stephanie Preston will discuss data and theory
on the proximate interrelationship between human acquisitiveness,
reward processing, animal food storing, and human compulsive hoarding. Finally, Antonio Rangel will discuss recent research investigating
differences in the brains of individuals that internalize the consequences
of their decisions on the future and on others, and those that do not.
Through an integrative view, we can better address widespread problems associated with our consumptive drives.
ABSTRACTS

THE ROLE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND SATIABILITY ON CONSUMPTION
DECISIONS Morten L. Kringelbach1,2; 1University of Oxford, 2Aarhus
University — The advanced human ability to consciously predict the outcome of choices and actions confers our species with an evolutionary
advantage. However, human conscious planning is a double-edged
sword, as John Steinbeck pointed out as he described “the tragic miracle
of consciousness” and how our “species is not set, has not jelled, but is
still in a state of becoming.” We have previously argued that conscious
planning can help the classic problem in animal learning of how to optimize exploration and exploitation; where exploration is the time spent
sampling the outcome of different behaviors and exploitation is the time
spent using existing behaviors with known reward values. Progress has
been made in characterizing the underlying brain networks, and the similarities and differences across rodents, monkeys, and humans. Data
show that many regions in a distributed brain network are involved in
the processing of reward and pleasure. In particular, we have begun
characterizing the necessary and sufficient regions for implementing the
underlying mechanisms of wanting, liking, and learning. Some of this
processing is non-conscious (especially in sub-cortical areas), but I will
describe how the human orbitofrontal cortex is important for interfacing
complex, non-conscious and conscious cycles of pleasure (expectation,
consumption, satiety and learning) with various sub-regions that code
for distinct aspects of the cycle. I will focus on differences between the
processing of fundamental (food and sex) and higher-order rewards
(money), where the latter’s lack of appropriate satiety mechanisms may
provide clues to our current troubled state of over-consumption.

DISTINCT ROLES OF MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE PROJECTION AREAS IN
PURCHASING Brian Knutson1; 1Stanford University — Converging comparative and neuroimaging research now suggests that the nucleus
accumbens (NAcc) plays a key role in anticipation of diverse gains (e.g.,
social, edible, monetary), while a region of the medial prefrontal cortex
(MPFC) integrates value across diverse dimensions (e.g., valence, probability, and time). These functions appear to inform and even predict
choice. For instance, in a shopping task, we found that while NAcc activation covaried with the attractiveness of a product, MPFC activation
specifically tracked its perceived monetary worth (Knutson et al., 2007).
Activation in both brain areas predicted purchasing. To further explore
the differences in their roles, we varied the order of product and price
information in a follow-up study. Subjects either saw products first followed by associated prices, or prices first followed by associated products (Karmarkar et al., In Prep.). When price was presented first, NAcc
response to the product continued to predict purchasing, but MPFC
response to price did not. These anatomically-targeted findings were
verified and extended in whole brain prediction analyses. This pattern of
results is consistent with the notion that the NAcc plays a critical role in
gain anticipation while the MPFC subserves value integration. Together,
the findings highlight the distinct contributions of different mesolimbic
projection regions to consumer choice.

THE ROLE OF DISTRIBUTED NEURAL SYSTEMS IN NORMAL AND
PATHOLOGICAL ACQUISITIVENESS Stephanie D. Preston1; 1University of
Michigan — Americans spend much of their free time shopping and organizing their ever-accumulating piles of paper, clothes, and gadgets. Our
acquisitive habits have real consequences for the environment, quality of
life, and even mortality, but research has yet to directly investigate their
neurobiological bases. Research on the neurobiology of normal purchasing, animal food storing, and human compulsive hoarding implicates
the mesolimbocortical system in decisions to acquire rewards. However,
acquisitiveness per se entails the acquisition and failure to discard a
wide variety of even mundane goods. We investigated the neural bases
of acquisitiveness using a functional neuroimaging task where participants acquired or discarded everyday items while maximizing personal
preference or profit. The orbital frontal cortex (OFC) was involved across
frames while the NAcc was not. Instead, the NAcc activity scaled during
acquisition with real-world hoarding impairment, suggesting that even
common items may acquire an “incentive salience” for acquisitive individuals. Personal decisions recruited midline frontal regions and were
biased towards inexpensive, immediate rewards (e.g., candy, coins).
Monetary decisions recruited executive regions and biased choice
towards valuable, decorative items that were not particularly desired.
Acquisition augmented OFC involvement and biased subjects towards
shiny, metallic objects while discarding recruited the anterior cingulate
and insula, and biased subjects towards utilitarian, “should” items.
Across studies, acquisitiveness may reflect future-oriented concerns that
directly enhance the perception of mundane but potentially useful items.
By examining the human urge to consume, we can understand and abate
problems associated with our seemingly bottomless need, in a context of
diminishing natural resources.

THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF SELF-VERSUS-OTHER AND NOW-VERSUS-LATER
DECISIONS Antonio Rangel1; 1California Institute of Technology — Many
important human decisions involve tradeoffs between rewards for the
self and for others (e.g., sacrificing consumption to donate to a charity),
and between immediate and delayed rewards (e.g., forgoing dessert to
improve future health). A sizable body of evidence in psychology and
economics has shown that it is difficult to make good decisions in
domains involving these types of tradeoffs, and that individuals differ
significantly on the extent to which they are able to incorporate the consequences of their actions on others and on the future. This raises two
fundamental questions in decision neuroscience. First, what is different
about the neural computations that are required for making decisions
that involve these types of tradeoffs, as opposed to decisions that do not?
Second, what is different about the brains of individuals who make good

16

decisions in these domains? We have investigated these two questions in
a series of human fMRI studies involving charitable donations, monetary
transfers between individuals, dietary choices, and saving decisions. The
findings from these studies suggest that, as is the case in simple choices,
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) encodes value signals to
guide decisions. Furthermore, in individuals who are able to internalize
future and other’s benefits, areas such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) modulate the value
the value signals in vmPFC so that they reflect these other dimensions. In
contrast, this modulation does not take place in selfish and short-sighted
individuals.

Symposium Session 4
THE BILINGUAL BRAIN

A bilingual is not two monolinguals in one head. Whereas bilinguals can
for the most part express themselves in two languages, the capacity to do
so is not identical in each language. In this symposium, we will present
data that show the rich interaction between the learning of two languages and various other cognitive and linguistic processes. The first
talk considers how native and non-native speakers of Basque process
grammatical functions. Although the behavioral data are identical, the
brain systems used are different. This suggests that the bilingual brain
may come to achieve the same goal using a different configuration relative to monolinguals. The second talk considers the nature of vocabulary
learning and its effect on semantic processing. Second language learning
occurs rapidly in adults and leads to almost immediate changes in the
word recognition system. Hence, the plasticity that is usually associated
with children appears to extend at least into adulthood. The third presentation considers how L2 acquisition interacts with mathematical computations. These results show that mathematics is sensitive to the
language in which it was learned. This coding may remain language specific even when that language becomes less proficient. The fourth and
final talk considers how deaf bilinguals process their two languages: one
spoken and the other signed. Despite gross differences in the articulators
used to produce these languages, research suggests that they engage
broadly similar neural systems. What emerges from this literature is a
complex and interesting set of relationships between language, cognition
and the particular brain areas devoted to these functions.

BRAIN REGIONS SUBSERVING GRAMMATICAL PROCESSING: EVIDENCE
FROM NATIVE AND PROFICIENT NONNATIVE BASQUE SPEAKERS

Mante S. Nieuwland1, Andrea E. Martin1, Manuel Carreiras1; 1Basque Center
on Cognition, Brain and Language — Quantitative and qualitative differ-

ences in native and nonnative sentence processing may surface especially around linguistic parameters that are not shared between L1 and
L2. This could mean that even between proficient native Spanish speakers of Basque and native Basque speakers, quantitative and/or qualitative differences exist in processing related to the Basque case system,
which is fundamentally different from that of Spanish, but not in processing related to the number agreement, which occurs in both languages. In an event-related FMRI experiment, we tested this hypothesis
by examining the cortical networks involved in Basque sentence processing in native Basque speakers and highly proficient native Spanish
speakers of Basque. Participants read sentences containing case violations or number violations and correct sentences while performing an
acceptability judgment task. Preliminary results (6 nonnative and 18
native speakers) suggest that whereas participants were more accurate
for case violations than for number violations or correct sentences, the

two groups did not show any behavioral differences. In native speakers,
case violations elicited relative activation increases compared to correct
sentences in the inferior parietal lobules, the posterior cingulate and in
the precuneus, while number violations elicited additional activation
increases in left middle and inferior frontal cortex consistent with reports
for morphosyntactic agreement errors. The nonnative speakers showed
roughly similar activation patterns but with additional effects in medial
prefrontal cortex. While more data for nonnative speakers is needed, the
current patterns of results suggest that they achieve the same behavioral
outcome via differential neural recruitment.

EARLY VOCABULARY ACQUISITION OF L2 LEADS TO RAPID CHANGES IN
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES Katherine J. Midgley1,2, Laura N.
Soskey1, Jonathan Grainger2, Phillip J. Holcomb1; 1Tufts University,

2Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive — How fast does the brain of second

language (L2) learners adapt to the process of learning? And are these
processes reliant on the same neural signatures as those used in a first
language (L1). In order to explore whether the mechanisms involved in
word recognition in beginning L2 learners differ from those of more proficient L2 users and how these mechanisms evolve during beginning
learning we conducted three experimental ERP sessions at intervals
throughout a semester with participants that were L1 monolingual
English-speakers enrolled in an introductory Spanish course. Our results
replicated previous studies that show greater negativities in the N400
epoch to L1 items t han to L2 items. Additionally the differences varied
significantly across sessions in that amplitudes in the traditional N400
epoch to L2 items became more negative over the course of the semester.
We propose that the increasing N400 amplitude to L2 items results from
an increase in L2 orthographic and semantic connectivity in the mental
lexicon due to L2 learning. Our results suggest that these changes happen quickly and early on in L2 acquisition.

ARITHMETIC REPRESENTATIONS AND THE BILINGUAL BRAIN

Nicole Y.
Wicha1, Elena Salillas2; 1University of Texas at San Antonio, 2Basque Center
on Cognition, Brain and Language — The bilingual brain provides a unique
test of the debated math-language connection with multiple language
mappings for a single arithmetic concept. It has been argued that exact
mathematical concepts, like simple multiplications, are represented in a
language-specific format and are therefore accessed more efficiently in
the language in which they were learned. However, factors like language
proficiency play an important role in bilingual language processing,
affecting the efficiency of retrieving and using words. By inference, language proficiency could similarly affect accessing and processing language-dependent arithmetic concepts. We measured event related
potentials to determine if early learning plays a critical role in the mathlanguage connection in the adult. Adult bilinguals proficient in Spanish
and English, who learned arithmetic in only one language during childhood, made correctness judgments on simple multiplication problems;
the problems were presented as digits or number words in Spanish or
English, and the solutions were either correct (2x3=6), or related (15) or
unrelated (13) as factors of the operands. Our results show that arithmetic facts are organized into strong associative memory networks for
the language in which arithmetic was learned (LolA), with a weaker network in the other language (Ll2). Although frequency of use changed
overall processing efficiency in Ll2, it did not strengthen the spread of
activation to related concepts. In addition, Ll2 elicited quantitatively and
qualitatively different responses compared to LolA and digit formats.
Finally, high proficiency in Ll2 and Ll2 dominance did not change the
networks for arithmetic in either language. Thus, we demonstrate that a
connection between language and math is established at the time of
learning and maintained into adulthood, independent of natural language use. These findings highlight that bilinguals should not be treated
as two monolinguals in one brain, and may have important implications
for teaching and testing bilingual children and young adults.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Mairead MacSweeney1; 1Institute of
Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London — Although many deaf

THE DEAF BILINGUAL BRAIN

people use a signed language as their preferred language, they all must
live in a hearing world and engage with spoken language via
speechreading and reading. Therefore, all deaf people may be regarded
as bilingual to some degree. Previous studies examining hearing speakers and deaf signers separately have established that broadly similar
neural systems are recruited to process speech and sign (see MacSweeney et al., 2008). In this talk, I will present data exploring the neural
basis of signed and spoken language processing within the same deaf
individuals. I will report findings from studies in which we have compared speechreading (lipreading) with the perception of signs and also
reading with fingerspelling (words spelled out using a manual alphabet). In particular, I will focus on results from an explicit sublexical (phonological) awareness task. This consisted of rhyme judgements for
words (written or picture stimuli) and ‘location’ judgements for signs
(signs or picture stimuli) – location being one of the sublexical parameters of signs. Using these tasks, we demonstrate that, even at the phonological level, very similar regions are recruited to process speech and
sign. Further, we show that sublexical processing of speech and sign is
characterised by similar temporal dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate
that age of sign language acquisition influences the network recruited.
Our findings support the proposal (e.g., Mayberry, 2009) that a robust
first language – in this case a signed language – is important to establishing the neural architecture with which to learn another language later in
life.

The efficient analysis and representation of person-related information is
one of the most important challenges for human social perception. While
faces are known to provide a large variety of socially relevant information, this symposium explicitly adopts a multimodal view of person perception. Specifically, faces, voices, and biological motion signals all
contain a number of dimensions including identity, age, gender, or emotional expression that may play different roles depending on context and
task. This set of talks illustrates both interactive processing of multiple
dimensions within a given domain, and functional and neuronal similarities or differences between domains when processing person-related
social information. One presentation (Wiese) focuses on specific mechanisms in face perception, and their neurocognitive correlates, that relate
to diminished recognition memory for faces from different age or ethnic
groups. The second talk (Troje) presents a current framework to understand person perception from biological motion signals, considering various processing levels and informational dimensions. The third
presentation (Belin) summarizes research on voice perception that specifies selectivity, neural correlates and cerebral dynamics, as well as functional similarities to face perception. The final talk (Schweinberger)
presents studies that investigate audiovisual face-voice integration in the
recognition of familiar people. As a whole, these presentations sketch
future directions in person perception research as an integrated enterprise that elucidates how multiple and multimodal social information
about others is processed and represented in the brain.

THE ROLE OF RACE AND AGE FOR RECOGNITION MEMORY OF
UNFAMILIAR FACES Holger Wiese1; 1Friedrich Schiller University of
Jena — Humans are better at remembering faces of their own ethnic and
age groups as compared to other-race and other-age faces. Theoretical
accounts for these so-called own-race and own-age biases emphasize a
critical role of different amounts of contact or expertise with faces of different groups. In this talk, I will present both behavioral and ERP evidence in support of this account. First, long-term expertise with a limited
number of other-race faces reduces both the own-race bias and its ERP
correlate in the occipito-temporal P2. However, whereas ERP correlates
of same- and other-race processing during learning depend on situational factors such as task demands, the behavioral own-race bias does
not. Second, an own-age bias has been demonstrated repeatedly in
young adult participants. Whether a corresponding bias for elderly participants emerges was found to depend on the amount of contact with
younger people. Third, results from a combined own-race and own-age
bias experiment demonstrated differences in the neural processes underlying the two effects. Specifically, while an own-age bias independent of
face ethnicity was observed in the N250 (probably related to implicit
memory) as well as in a 300-500 ms time range at central and parietal
scalp sites, an own-race bias independent of age was detected in a 500800 ms time window, which probably reflects enhanced recollection
based processing. Overall, while these findings suggest a lack of expertise with “out-group” faces as one mechanism mediating both the ownage and own-race bias, the exact memory related neural processes for the
two phenomena differ.

THE MULTIPLE FACES OF BIOLOGICAL MOTION PERCEPTION Nikolaus

F. Troje1, Daniel R. Saunders1; 1Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario — Since
Gunnar Johannson coined the term almost 40 years ago “biological
motion” has been used for a variety of different phenomena. Some of
them are complementary to each other and probably constitute entirely
different processing mechanisms. A clear distinction between them is
crucial to design both behavioural and neuroimaging studies, to assess
their results, and to compare them among different studies. I will provide a careful analysis of the multiple facets of biological motion perception and I will suggest a framework that helps to safely navigate through
concepts and experimental paradigms employed in biological motion
research. In particular, I will show experimental data that demonstrate
the dissociation between a processing level that uses local motion invariants to detect biological motion and label it as being animate, as compared to mechanisms that use motion to derive the articulated structure
of a moving body, and derive information about actor and action. I will
then introduce a standardized battery of tests which is able to independently probe performance on these and a number of additional key
aspects of biological motion perception, along with normative data and a
test-retest reliability analysis. Applications of this test in neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience are discussed.

PERSON PERCEPTION BY VOICE: COGNITIVE AND CEREBRAL
MECHANISMS Pascal Belin1; 1University of Glasgow — The human voice
carries speech, but is also an "auditory face" rich in person-related information, which normal listeners are expert at processing for optimal
social interactions. We study the cerebral processing of vocal information using behavioural (voice morphing), EEG and fMRI methods. In a
series of experiments in normal subjects, we examined the cortical processing of sounds of human voices and found that (i) perceiving sounds
of voice involves voice-selective ‘temporal voice areas’ (TVA) in auditory cortex, located along the middle part of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) bilaterally; (ii) the TVA in the right anterior STS are
particularly involved in the paralinguistic aspects of voice perception,
including speaker recognition, and gender perception; (iii) the selectivity
to voice appears to be largely species-specific, i.e., sounds of animal
voices induce a much more restricted activation of STS, but is also
observed in the macaque brain; (iv) the dynamics of cerebral voice processing involve a time-course analogous to that evidenced for face processing with voice-selective activity emerging around 170 msec after
onset; (v) the TVA interact in a task-selective manner with regions of
inferior prefrontal cortex, consistent with a dense pattern of connections
between inferior prefrontal cortex and the ‘what’ stream of auditory processing. Together, these results indicate that the different types of vocal
information (identity, affect, …) are processed in interacting but partially
dissociated functional pathways, suggesting a neuro-cognitive model of
voice perception with principles of organization similar to those put forward for face perception.

AUDIOVISUAL FACE-VOICE INTEGRATION IN THE RECOGNITION OF
FAMILIAR PEOPLE Stefan R. Schweinberger1; 1Friedrich Schiller University
of Jena — Audiovisual integration (AVI) is a well-known aspect of speech
perception, but integration of facial and vocal information is also important for speaker recognition. We demonstrate AVI in the recognition of
familiar (but not unfamiliar) speakers. Specifically, systematic behavioural benefits in recognising a familiar voice occur when the voice is
combined with an articulating face of corresponding speaker identity,
and costs occur for voices combined with precisely time-synchronised
noncorresponding faces. AVI is shown (a) to depend on familiarity with
a speaker, (b) to show sensitivity to temporal synchronization of facial
and vocal articulations, and (c) to occur both for voice and face recognition tasks. Experiments with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) compared unimodal (face only, voice only) conditions with audiovisual
conditions (AV corresponding, AV noncorresponding). The results suggest that audiovisual speaker identity correspondence influences later
ERPs beyond 250 ms only, with increased right frontotemporal negativity for noncorresponding identities. Remarkably, when compared with
the summed responses from both unimodal conditions, both audiovisual
conditions elicited a much earlier onset of frontocentral negativity, with
maximal differences around 50-80 ms. These findings suggest that the
perception of a voice and a time-synchronised articulating face triggers
surprisingly early and mandatory mechanisms of audiovisual processing, although the correspondence or discrepancy in audiovisual speaker
identity may only be computed about 200 ms later.

WORKING MEMORY STORAGE RELIES ON NEITHER SUSTAINED NOR
ELEVATED ACTIVITY (GSP WINNER) Adam C. Riggall1, Bradley R. Postle1;

1University of Wisconsin-Madison — For at least the past 40 years, the con-

sensus view has been that the short-term retention of information is supported by the sustained, elevated activity that is often observed in
electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
measurements of working memory-task performance. Here, we report
results that directly challenge this assumption. Subjects were scanned
(fMRI) while performing delayed-recognition of visual motion (directions or speeds; probed unpredictably). Data were analyzed with both a
general linear model (GLM) that tested whether delay-period activity
was greater than baseline, and pattern classifiers trained to discriminate
either directions or speeds of motion. Consistent with prior work, the
GLM revealed sustained, elevated delay-period activity in superior frontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus across participants. Strikingly, classifiers restricted to these same regions failed to recover trial-specific
stimulus information. In contrast, classifiers restricted to posterior sensory regions that did not show elevated delay-period activity, including
V1 and MT, did recover substantial trial-specific stimulus information.
Wholebrain timepoint-by-timepoint follow-up classification analyses
indicated that trial-specific stimulus information was consistently recoverable throughout the delay-period. These analyses also showed that the
importance of many voxels to classification (particularly in superior
frontal and parietal areas) waxed and waned over time. Thus, once one
“leaves” posterior visual regions, working memory storage is accomplished by broadly distributed, dynamically shifting networks.

AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE NEURAL REPRESENTATION OF WORKING
MEMORY REVEALED BY MULTI-VOXEL PATTERN ANALYSIS. Joshua

Carp1, Leon Gmeindl2, Patricia Reuter-Lorenz1; 1University of Michigan,
2
Johns Hopkins University — Working memory function declines across the
lifespan. Computational models of aging attribute such memory impairments to reduced distinctiveness between neural representations of different mental states in old age, a phenomenon termed dedifferentiation.
These models predict that neural distinctiveness should be reduced uniformly across experimental conditions in older adults. In contrast, the
Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis
(CRUNCH) model predicts that the distinctiveness of neural representations should be increased in older adults (relative to young adults) at low
levels of task demand but reduced at high levels of demand. The present
study used multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to measure the effects
of age and task demands on the distinctiveness of the neural representa-

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

tions of verbal and visuospatial working memory. Results from sensory
cortex during encoding and retrieval supported the dedifferentiation
hypothesis: distinctiveness of visual cortical representations during
these phases was uniformly reduced in older adults, irrespective of
memory load. However, maintenance-related responses in prefrontal
and parietal regions yielded a strikingly different pattern of results. At
low loads, older adults showed higher distinctiveness than younger
adults; at high loads, this pattern reversed, such that distinctiveness was
higher in young adults. This interaction between age group and memory
load is at odds with the dedifferentiation hypothesis but consistent with
CRUNCH. In sum, our results provide partial support for both dedifferentiation- and compensation-based models; we argue that comprehensive theories of cognitive aging must incorporate aspects of both models
to fully explain complex patterns of age-related neuro-cognitive change.

RTMS-INDUCED CHANGES IN SUSTAINED DELAY-PERIOD ALPHA-BAND
POWER RELIABLY PREDICT PERFORMANCE ON SPATIAL WORKING
MEMORY TASKS Jeffrey Johnson1, Bradley Postle1; 1University of
Wisconsin-Madison — Previous work has shown that 10-Hz rTMS of the
superior parietal lobule (SPL) influences performance on spatial (but not
object) delayed-recognition (Hamidi, et al., 2009). Using simultaneous
rTMS/EEG, it was found that for a given subject, the direction and magnitude of the rTMS effect on performance was predicted by individual
differences in its effect on sustained delay-period alpha-band power
(DPABP): If 10-Hz rTMS increased DPABP, behavioral performance
declined, if it decreased DPABP, performance improved. However, the
reliability of these effects has not been established, nor has their generality been explored. In the present study, we sought to replicate the earlier
findings in a new group of subjects, and to explore their generalization
to other stimulus types and to lateralized presentation. While receiving
10-Hz rTMS to the left SPL, subjects performed spatial and color
delayed-recognition in two conditions—memory targets presented bilaterally vs. in one (pre-cued) hemifield. Results from the bilateral- and leftvisual field conditions replicated the earlier findings: rTMS effects on
DPABP and behavior were correlated, but only for location memory. For
the right-visual field (RVF) condition, in contrast, 10-Hz rTMS of the left
SPL increased DPABP and impaired performance in both color and location delayed-recognition. The “bilateral” results establish the reliability
of the earlier findings, and will enable us to begin exploring the effects of
varying rTMS parameters. The "RVF" results suggest that color and location memory may have relied preferentially on left-posterior cortical
regions, and that rTMS effects, though distributed, may be more potent
in the stimulated hemisphere.

ARROW-ELICITED CUEING EFFECTS AT SHORT INTERVALS: RAPID
ATTENTIONAL ORIENTING OR CUE-TARGET STIMULUS CONFLICT?
Jessica Green1, Marissa Gamble1, Michael Rosenthal1, Marty Woldorff1;
1Duke University — Reaction time (RT) cueing effects (faster responses for

cued than uncued targets) have been observed rapidly following centrally presented arrow cues, leading to the suggestion that arrows can
trigger rapid, automatic, shifts of attention, in addition to slower, voluntary attentional shifts. However, studies that have reported rapid cueing

19

Slide Sessions
effects following arrows typically have had the cue and target remain on
the screen until the behavioral response. We hypothesized that the rapid
arrow-triggered cueing effects may actually reflect non-attentional processes influenced by stimulus duration. To test this hypothesis we
manipulated stimulus duration in attention-cueing experiments using
both spatially predictive and non-predictive arrow cues. Target stimuli
were presented either simultaneously with the cue or at stimulus onset
asynchronies (SOAs) ranging from 100-600 ms. Cueing effects at short
SOAs were observed only for long-duration stimuli, and the effects were
driven by slowing in the uncued-target responses, rather than the facilitated processing of cued targets that attentional explanations would predict. Moreover, these cueing effects were observed even when the cue
and target were presented simultaneously and participants could not
possibly have shifted attention in advance of the target. We propose that
when the cue and target are presented simultaneously, or nearly so, and
remain on the screen together, they are grouped into a single object that
contains either congruent (cued) or incongruent (uncued) spatial information. Further support for this explanation comes from event-related
potentials (ERPs) at fronto-central scalp sites, which show typical attention effects at long SOAs but conflict-like effects at short SOAs.

THE ACC RESPONDS TO DETECTED ERRORS AND UNEXPECTED
NEGATIVE FEEDBACK IN A COMPLEX TASK. Elena Patsenko1, Erik M.

Altmann1, David C. Zhu1; 1Michigan State University — Several accounts of
anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) function currently exist. The results of
the present research challenge the idea that the ACC performs conflict
monitoring, and they are consistent with the idea that the ACC responds
to worse-than-expected outcomes. In the present study, I develop a paradigm in which a memory task and a multiple object tracking tasks are
combined. Participants receive feedback on the accuracy of their performance only after both tasks are completed. Negative feedback is ambiguous in terms of what type of error occurred (memory or tracking). After
receiving negative feedback, participants are asked to interpret it. Most
of the time the interpretations are correct (e.g. when participants make a
memory error they indicate that they made a memory error); however,
sometimes the interpretations are incorrect (e.g. when participants make
a memory error they indicate that they made a tracking error). I assume
here that participants interpret feedback correctly if they detect an error
and they interpret feedback incorrectly if they miss an error. I found that
a region in the left ACC was more active to detected errors than undetected errors during task performance, but during feedback the pattern was
reversed, such that the region was more active to undetected errors than
to detected errors. The pattern is problematic for the conflict monitoring
theory, because there is no conflict during feedback processing. The
results are consistent with the reinforcement learning theory, since both
error detection and processing of unexpected negative feedback are
worse-than-expected outcomes.

IMPROVEMENT OF ERROR AWARENESS AND MODULATION OF ERRORRELATED BOLD ACTIVITY VIA SINGLE-DOSE OF METHYLPHENIDATE IN
HEALTHY ADULTS Robert Hester1, L. Sanjay Nandam2, Joe Wagner2,

Pradeep J. Nathan3, Jason B. Mattingley2, Mark A. Bellgrove2; 1University of
Melbourne, Department of Psychological Sciences, Melbourne, Victoria,
Australia, 2The University of Queensland, Queensland Brain Institute and
School of Psychology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, 3University of
Cambridge, Department of Psychiatry and GlaxoSmithKline, UK — Poor detection of errors has been linked to clinical symptoms including the loss of
insight, delusions and perseverative behaviour, in conditions such as
schizophrenia and drug addiction. These conditions share alterations in
monoamine signalling that may influence the neural mechanisms underlying error processing, however our understanding of the neurochemical
drivers is limited. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, cross-over design of the influence of selective dopamine
(methylphenidate), noradrenaline (atomoxetine) and serotonin (citalopram) reuptake inhibitors on error awareness in 27 healthy participants.
The Error Awareness Task, a Go/No-go response inhibition paradigm,

20

was administered to assess the influence of monoaminergic agents on
errors that the participant was either aware or unaware of committing
and the associated event-related fMRI changes. Methylphenidate was
associated with a significant improvement in error awareness, but not
response inhibition accuracy or speed, in comparison to placebo and
either atomoxetine or citalopram. Methylphenidate also significantly
influenced BOLD activity arising from the anterior cingulate cortex and
inferior parietal regions, with moderate increases in aware error activity
and large decreases in unaware error activity when compared to the placebo condition. These data suggest dopamine may aid attention to task,
thereby setting ideal conditions for promoting awareness of one’s errors.
Given the relationship between the severity of awareness deficits and
clinical symptoms in psychiatric conditions, the current data highlight
the potential for such medications to enhance error awareness and in
turn improve clinical outcomes.

A PROACTIVE MECHANISM FOR SELECTIVE SUPPRESSION OF
RESPONSE TENDENCIES Weidong Cai1, Caitlin Oldenkamp1, Adam Aron1;
1University of California, San Diego — How do we control our inappropriate

response tendencies? Much research has approached this question using
experimental tasks that require one to stop a response when a signal
occurs. Neuroscience studies show that stopping is achieved via an
influence of prefrontal cortex on the motor system. However, it remains
controversial whether this influence is best characterized as active suppression or a withdrawal of facilitation from the response effector. Here
we developed a novel behavioral task that requires subjects to prepare to
stop a specific response tendency. We used single pulse Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation to probe motor excitability. We found that the
motor-evoked potential (MEP) of the hand that might need to be stopped
in the future was significantly reduced compared to when that hand was
at rest. This MEP difference was visible even before there was any action.
Further, this ‘neural’ index of proactive and selective suppression predicted the subsequent selectivity with which the behavioral response
was stopped. These results provide unequivocal behavioral and physiological evidence to support the existence of an active suppression mechanism in the brain. They also clearly show that such a mechanism can be
applied in advance (proactively) and also targeted at a particular
response channel (selectively). The results have important implications
for theories of executive function and for developing ecologically valid
behavioral models for impulse control disorders.

FMRI-ADAPTATION REVEALS AN INTEGRATED REPRESENTATION OF
TASK-RULES AND REWARDS IN THE LATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX
Matthew L Dixon1, Kalina Christoff1; 1University of British Columbia — A

prominent view is that the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) supports various complex cognitive functions by representing rules that specify associations between stimuli in the environment and context appropriate
responses. However, we presently know little about how the brain represents the reward-value of different rules. The present study examined
the hypothesis that the lPFC integrates rules and rewards using a novel
fMRI-adaptation paradigm. On each trial, an instruction cue informed
participants (N = 15) of the appropriate rule to use (decide if face is
male/female or decide if word’s meaning is concrete/abstract) and
whether or not they could earn money based on their performance. Crucially, in half of the trials, a second instruction cue appeared and systematically varied with respect to the first: the rules repeated, the reward
repeated, both rules and reward repeated, or both rules and reward
changed. We looked for fMRI-adaptation when rules, reward, or their
combination repeated relative to when they were novel. We found that a
large expanse of the right lPFC including the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal sulcus exhibited fMRI-adaptation specifically
when both rule and reward information repeated. Additionally, the IFS
exhibited a significant increase in correlation with both rule-related and
reward-related brain regions during the appearance of an instruction cue
signaling a novel rule and reward. Our findings provide strong evidence
that lPFC rule processing is not simply modulated by reward processing

in other regions; rather, the lPFC integrates reward information into its
representation of rules, thus providing rules with value.

Charles Leek1, Julie Kerai1, John Hindle1, Martyn Bracewell1, Stephen
Johnston2; 1School of Psychology, Bangor University, Bangor, UK, 2School of
Psychology, Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK — Leek & Johnston (2009,

Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 10, 78-79) have suggested that one function of the anterior (pre-) SMA in humans is the computation of abstract
visuo-spatial vector transformations. On this account pre-SMA should
be involved in any task that requires the transformation or remapping of
a spatial location (vector) regardless of whether there is a motor component to the task. Here we test this hypothesis with converging evidence
of SMA involvement in spatial and non-spatial tasks using fMRI and
studies of Parkinson’s disease (PD) – one known consequence of which
is SMA dysfunction as a result of dopamine depletion in the nigro-striatal pathway of the basal ganglia. Spatial tasks included abstract grid
transformation and mental rotation. Non-spatial tasks included serial
subtraction and VSTM for spatial locations which provide controls for
sequencing, numerical processing and the encoding of spatial vectors.
Functional imaging results showed partially overlapping activation foci
in pre-SMA for abstract spatial and non-spatial tasks. PD patients were
impaired only in the abstract spatial transformation tasks. These results
provide new evidence about functional specialisation in the SMA. In
particular, they are consistent with the spatial vector transformation
hypothesis, and for the proposed role of pre-SMA in domain-general
computations involving the remapping of spatial locations during both
motor and non-motor cognitive operations.

ROBOTIC ACTIONS PREFERENTIALLY ENGAGE THE HUMAN MIRROR
SYSTEM Emily S. Cross1,2, Roman Liepelt2,3, Antonia F. de C. Hamilton4,

Jim Parkinson2, Richard Ramsey4, Waltraud Stadler2, Wolfgang Prinz2;
1Radboud University Nijmegen, 2Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and
Brain Sciences, 3Westfälisches Wilhelms Universität Münster, 4University of
Nottingham — As humans, we gather a wide range of information about
other people from watching them move. A network of regions within the
human brain termed the ‘mirror system’ has been implicated in understanding others’ actions by means of an automatic matching process that
links observed and performed actions. Current views of the human mirror system assume a matching process biased towards actions that are
“like me”; specifically, those performed by conspecifics and present in
the observer’s motor repertoire. In the present study, we test the flexibility of this system when observing natural human motion compared to
rigid robot-like motion across two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. In Experiment 1, 22 participants
watched a human dance in a normal, fluid style, or in a rigid, robotic
style. Surprisingly, premotor and parietal regions responded more
robustly to robotic actions than to natural human actions. With Experiment 2, we aimed to replicate and extend this result with 23 new participants who watched the same human dancer or a Lego action figure
moving in the smooth human style or robotic style. Here again, more
robust activation emerged within mirror system regions when observing
a robotic dance style compared to the smooth, natural human style, inde-

pendent of whether the agent was a real human or a plastic robotic toy.
These findings challenge previous assumptions about mirror system
function by demonstrating that parietal and premotor cortices can be
flexibly engaged by novel, unfamiliar actions performed by both human
and non-human agents.

RAPID DETECTION OF CHANGES IN SOUND SOURCE LOCATION AS
REVEALED BY HUMAN AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIALS Sabine Grimm1,

Heike Althen1, Marc Recasens1, Carles Escera1; 1University of Barcelona,
Spain — The rapid discrimination of sound source locations is crucial in
order to group the auditory input and to selectively attend to specific
sound sources. The detection of changes in sound location has been
related to the mismatch negativity (MMN), an auditory evoked potential
(AEP) occurring at 100-250 ms after change onset. However, animal
recordings suggest much faster neural responses to contextually new or
deviant stimuli and recent studies have observed early indices of human
auditory deviance detection for spectral changes in the middle-latency
response (MLR) of the AEP. The present study investigates the processing of sound location changes by measuring the MLR during an oddball
paradigm in 20 human subjects. The auditory sequences were comprised
of clicks presented via loudspeakers in oddball blocks (80 % standards:
30^(0); 20 % deviants: 60^(0)), reversed oddball blocks (standards:
60^(0); deviants: 30^(0)), and control blocks (randomly from -60^(0), 30^(0), 0^(0), 30^(0), 60^(0)). Oddball blocks were presented both in the
left and right hemifield. Clicks presented at deviant locations elicited a
larger Na component of the MLR peaking at 17-23 ms compared to clicks
presented at the same site when it served as the standard or control location. Whereas the Na component itself was not lateralized, the deviancerelated increase in Na amplitude showed a significant dominance over
the hemisphere contralateral to the side of stimulation. This indicates
that the discrimination of rare spatial changes initiates very quickly, at
about 20 ms after sound onset, reflected by an enhanced activity dominantly in contralateral auditory cortex regions.

LEARNING SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBJECT PERCEPTION ACROSS VARIABLE
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE: EVIDENCE FROM A COMBINED FMRI/EYE
TRACKING METHODS APPROACH Lauren Emberson1,2, Jenna Kahn1,

Sara Haas1, Dima Amso1; 1Brown University, 2Cornell University — The mechanisms of integration across variable experiences of a novel object are
poorly understood. We used an fMRI/eye-tracking methods approach to
examine the mechanisms involved in learning to segment a novel object
across variable experiences. We eye tracked 10 healthy adult participants
(SMI RED system), while acquiring fMRI data using a Siemens 3T TM
TRIO. We embedded an ‘ambiguous’ novel object (seen as a single
occluded whole or two broken parts) in a complex visual scene. We generated three less ambiguous views of the same object, in variable orientations and occluded in different locations (‘repeats’). Participants viewed
the scenes in sequential alternation. Only those who perceived the
ambiguous object as broken in a pretest were tested. After exposure, 50%
of participants changed their perception to indicate that the object was
complete (‘perceivers’). Fixation patterns illustrate that non-perceivers
had a larger number of fixations for the two parts of the ambiguous
object, while perceivers focused their attention on the occluder during
learning. A 2 (Ambiguous vs. Repeat) x 2 (Perceivers vs. Non-perceivers)
whole brain analysis revealed a reliable interaction in the caudate, hippocampus, inferior parietal, fusiform gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus.
Perceivers had higher activations for the unambiguous Repeats relative
to the Ambiguous scene, while non-perceivers had higher activations
during the Ambiguous scene. This suggests that perceivers are learning
to relate the redundant information across scenes to perceptually complete the object in the ambiguous figure. Learning and attentional mechanisms, in concert with visual experience, shape the perception of
complex objects.

Cambridge, 2University Hospital Basal — Current theories

of

of semantic
knowledge disagree about whether the first-order organising principle
of the neural representation of semantic information is in terms of categories [animals, tools] or distributed, feature-based representations. A
key claim of feature-based accounts is that statistical measures characterising the relationships amongst features provide an explanation of
apparent category-specific effects. To test the efficacy of category-specific and feature-based models to account for neural data, and determine
the temporal sequence of perceptual and semantic effects, representational similarity analysis (RSA) was applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded during a picture naming task. Using an MEG
searchlight procedure, we statistically evaluated whether each theoretical model was expressed in the MEG data. MEG signals were found to
reflect the perceptual similarity of objects after 100 ms, before effects of
visual-semantic features in posterior regions, showing an early transition
from purely perceptual effects to visual-semantic effects. Information
relating to the degree of shared/distinctive semantic features was available pre-200 ms, before significant effects of both the category-specific
models and those relating to shared/distinctive features beginning after
250 ms. Our results highlight the transition from perceptual to semantic
encoding of information over time and show that semantic models,
based on statistical distributed feature-based accounts, provide a more
detailed account of the perception-to-semantic transition than categoryspecific models which showed isolated effects. The results support feature-based accounts of semantic knowledge, and show that the time sensitive MEG patterns provide critical information about the nature of
object representations as revealed using RSA.

PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND DECISION MAKING IN HUMAN MEDIAL

Computational Neuroscience, Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin, 2Berlin
School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt-Universität Berlin, 3Otto-von-Guericke
University, Magdeburg — The dominant view that visual perceptual learning is accompanied by changes in early visual representations has
recently been challenged. Current studies suggest that performance
improvements are rather related to changes in higher decision-making
areas of the cortex. Here we used a model-based neuroimaging approach
to test the idea that visual perceptual learning can be accounted for by
reinforcement learning involving changes in higher decision-making
areas. We trained 20 subjects on an orientation-discrimination task with
explicit performance feedback over the course of four days. FMRI data
was acquired on the first and last day of training. Behavioral improvements were well explained by a reinforcement learning model for perceptual decision making. Perceptual improvements in this model are
accompanied by an enhanced read-out of sensory information, thereby
establishing noise-robust representations of decision variables that form
the basis for perceptual choices. Using multivariate information mapping techniques (searchlight decoding), we find sensory evidence
encoded in early visual cortex as well as in higher-order brain regions.
However, only activity patterns in the medial frontal cortex (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) tracked learning-related changes in the modelderived decision variables. These results provide strong evidence for
perceptual learning related changes in higher-order cortical regions. Furthermore, our results suggest that perceptual and reward-based learning
are likely to be based on a common neurobiological mechanism. Our
findings thus help to narrow the long established gap between perceptual and reward based learning and decision making.

EVIDENCE FOR CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT OF FACE- AND PLACESELECTIVE REGIONS IN THE HUMAN VENTRAL-TEMPORAL CORTEX

Golijeh Golarai1, Alina Liberman1, Kalanit Grill-Spector1; 1Stanford
University — Functional regions in the human ventral temporal cortex
(VTC) preferentially respond to faces, objects or places. Recent studies
suggest that face-selective activations in the fusiform gyrus (FFA) and
place-selective activations in the parahippocampal gyrus (PPA) undergo
a prolonged development after age 7. However, the end-point of these
developments or sensitivity to the type of face or scene stimuli is
unknown. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
to examine the development of face-, object- or place-selective responses
in the VTC of adults (18 – 40 years, n = 11), adolescents (12 – 16 years, n =
14) and children (7 – 11 years, n = 10). During fMRI, subjects viewed
faces of boys, men, objects, indoor or outdoor scenes and scrambled
images in blocks. We defined the FFA and the PPA in each subject. The
volume of the right FFA was substantially larger in adults than in adolescents and children, correlating with age, regardless of the age of the
face stimuli. This development was associated with higher response
amplitudes and selectivity for faces compared to objects, and increased
differentiation of the distributed responses to faces versus non-face stimuli in the VTC. Similarly, the volume of the left PPA was significantly
larger in adults than in children, along with age related increases in
selectivity for scenes in the left VTC. However, left PPA’s development
was specific to indoor but not outdoor scenes. These results suggest a
prolonged development of face- and place- selectivity across the VTC
during childhood and adolescence.

DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS IN THE SPEECH PERCEPTION OF BILINGUAL
CHILDREN Pilar Archila-Suerte1, Jason Zevin2, Arturo Hernandez1;
1University

of Houston, 2Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology
Weill Medical College of Cornell University — The ability to discriminate
non-native phonemes gradually diminishes in the first year of life and
early childhood. This change from language-general to language-specific
perception is poorly understood in bilingual children. Our goal is to
reveal the neural substrates of non-native speech perception in children
undergoing linguistic development. In a passive listening fMRI task, 38
Spanish-English bilinguals between the ages of 6 and 10 were asked to
watch a silent movie while second language (L2) syllable combinations
(saf-saf; saf-sof; saf-suf; sof-sof; sof-suf; suf-suf) played through a pair of
headphones. Language assessments were conducted in each language to
obtain measures of proficiency. A multiple regression analysis using age,
proficiency in English, and proficiency in Spanish as regressors showed
that brain activity for non-native speech was negatively related to age
and positively related to Spanish proficiency. Younger bilingual children
activated subcortical areas (i.e., bilateral caudate nucleus and hippocampus, and right putamen) and areas involved in early auditory processing
(bilateral superior temporal gyrus). On the other hand, better Spanish
proficiency led to increased activity in the parietal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus. This reflects the involvement of sensory integration and
awareness in linguistically advanced children. The data suggest that
behavioral differences in non-native perception are the result of the brain
areas developmentally available for the processing of speech.

VALUE AND PREDICTION ERROR IN THE HUMAN MEDIAL FRONTAL
CORTEX: INTEGRATING THE SINGLE-UNIT AND SYSTEMS LEVELS OF
ANALYSIS Massimo Silvetti1, Ruth Seurinck1, Tom Verguts1; 1Ghent
University — The role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in cognition
has been extensively investigated with several techniques, including single-unit recordings in rodents and monkeys and EEG and fMRI in
humans. Based on these studies, various competing theories of ACC
function have been proposed, such as reward computation, error detection, conflict monitoring, error likelihood estimation, and estimation of
reward volatility. Here we present a unifying theory showing that all the
different functions ascribed to the ACC could be grounded on a basic
computation consisting of the estimation of value (expected reward) by
means of prediction errors. This view is instantiated in the Reward Value
and Prediction Model (RVPM). The model contains units coding for the
value of cues (stimuli or actions) and units coding for the differences
between such values and the actual reward (i.e., prediction errors). We
exposed the model to typical experimental paradigms used in singleunit, EEG and fMRI research to compare its overall behaviour with the
data from these studies. The model reproduced the ACC behaviour of
previous single-unit, EEG and fMRI studies on conditioning, error processing, conflict monitoring, error-likelihood estimation, and volatility
estimation. Finally it provided also a computational account for the temporal shifting of brainstem dopaminergic neuron responses from reward
onset to conditional stimulus onset, unifying the all the interpretations of
the role performed by the ACC in cognition within the theoretical
domain of Reinforcement Learning.

VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX LESIONS IMPAIR IMPLICIT BUT
NOT EXPLICIT ASPECTS OF PROSPECTIVE MEMORY Asaf

Israel, 4University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel, 5Rambam Medical Centre, Haifa,
Israel, 6 — Cognitive models of Prospective Memory (PM) propose two
types of mechanisms: (1) conscious explicit cue-detection mechanisms;
(2) Non-conscious (implicit) mechanisms which provide representations
of to-be-performed actions with heightened activation and privileged
access to consciousness. We have reported that lesions to the polar prefrontal cortex (Brodman areas 10 and 9) cause a severe impairment on
tasks that require detection of PM cues during an ongoing task, regardless of whether the PM cues involve effortful or effortless detection in
healthy controls. By contrast, tasks that tap the underlying (implicit) representations of intentions to perform an action are unaffected by lesions
to polar PFC. These include normal patterns of Intention Superiority
Effects (ISE) for to-be-performed actions and an Inhibition Effect (IE) for
prospective actions after they had been performed. In the present set of
studies we show that lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(VMPFC) produce the reverse pattern, with cue detection relatively
intact and no ISE or IE. Thus, this is the first report of a neuropsychological double dissociation between explicit detection of cues that support
the opportune recovery of prospective memory and implicit privileged
representation of prospective intentions. Our data are compatible with
the 'gateway hypothesis' which suggests the rostral PFC allows for the
flexible alternating of attention between external stimuli and internal
representations. The VMPFC, by contrast, appears to support cue-related
long-term anticipatory biases in accordance with its known role in
reward representation and reversal learning.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging and the theoretical
framework of cognitive linguistics and behavioral experimental designs
have raised new hypotheses and opened new possibilities to address the
perceptual and higher-order distinction in causality. In addition, as the
empirical research on the hierarchical functional organization of the
frontal rostro-caudal axis evolves, new questions arise on how this organization informs the differential processing of direct causal (e.g., one
object striking another object) and indirect causal (e.g., causal chains)
events. In this fMRI study, two different types of verbal instructions
directed the participants to detect either first or second-order relational
complexities in direct or indirect causal events. Direct causal judgment
recruited the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex more strongly when the participants were directed to detect first-order relational complexities rather
than second-order relational complexities. When they were directed to
detect second-order relational complexities, judging indirect causal and
non-causal events, as opposed to direct events, strongly activated the
rostrolateral prefrontal cortex along with more posterior regions of the
rostro-caudal frontal axis. The dorsal premotor cortex was activated during the judgment of both direct and indirect causal events. These data
provide new support for the hierarchical functional specialization of the
prefrontal cortex and lead to support that two different semantic representations of causality might influence cognitive control mechanisms,
memory resources, and preparatory motor responses when observers
represent complex visual causal stimuli.

EXPECTATIONS ABOUT STIMULI OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY FROM
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT TREATMENTS: THE ROLE OF EXPECTANCY
DURING OPIOID ANALGESIA Lauren Atlas1, Robert Whittington1, Joe

Wielgosz2, Tor Wager3; 1Columbia University, 2University of Wisconsin,
Madison, 3University of Colorado, Boulder — Expectations strongly influence how organisms perceive their environments. In humans, placeboinduced expectations about treatments (Outcome Expectancies) and cuebased expectations about stimulus intensity (Stimulus Expectancies)
modulate both pain reports and pain-evoked brain responses. Despite
overlapping neural correlates, the two are likely to have different underlying mechanisms. The placebo response involves sustained changes,
including endogenous opioid release (Levine et al., 1978). When Stimulus Expectancies vary from trial-to-trial, modulation must depend on
transient signals, such as expected value and prediction error processing
(Schoenbaum et al., 2007). To test whether these types of expectancies
operate independently, we manipulated both factors in a single paradigm. We used a balanced placebo design, which crossed Outcome
Expectancies (Expect drug vs. Expect no drug) with administration of
remifentanil, a potent opioid analgesic (Receive drug vs. Receive no
drug). Subjects (n=14) went through a concurrent Stimulus Expectancy
task (Atlas et al., 2010), in which cues predicted high or low noxious
heat, and each was occasionally followed by a single level of medium
stimulation. We found evidence for additive, independent contributions
of Stimulus Expectancies, Outcome Expectancies, and Drug treatment,
with no interactions. Subjects reported less pain when they believed they
were receiving remifentanil than when they believed they were not
receiving any drug (M.E. Outcome Expectancy, p<.05), and reported
more pain when medium stimulation was preceded by high-pain cues,
relative to low-pain cues (M.E. Stimulus Expectancy, p<.001). Thus, individuals can maintain expectations about treatment and expectations
about stimuli independently, supporting the hypothesis that these may
reflect separate underlying mechanisms.

Slide Sessions
control systems interact to guide the selection of rewarding options?
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded brain activations in subjects who were either free or constrained by external cues to
choose between a high-rewarded and a low-rewarded discrimination
task. We found that MFC supported free task selection based on reward
history. In addition, LFC activations classically associated with task
selection also increased and were functionally more connected to MFC
during reward-based compared to cue-based selection. Crucially, we
found dissociation between the integration of reward expectation in
MFC and LFC. MFC coded reward expectation during both reward- and
cue-based selections. By contrast, LFC integrated reward expectation
and was differently connected to MFC according to reward expectation
only during reward-based selection, but not during cue-based selection.
Our results support the idea that MFC codes reward expectation and, in
the absence of external constrain, biases LFC engagement in selection
processes toward the most rewarding option

O'Reilly3, John Anderson2; 1Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences,
University of Washington, 2Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon
University, 3Department of Psychology, University of Colorado at Boulder,
4Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University — A crucial but not

well understood aspect of intelligent behavior is the ability of executing
actions according to internal representations, such as plans or instructions. In order to investigate the neural mechanisms that allow instruction interpretation, we recruited twenty-one participants to perform the
novel experimental task in a 3T fMRI scanner. The task consists in performing arithmetic operations on two input numbers. Crucially, each
trial is divided into an Encoding phase, where the operations and their
order are revealed; and an Execution phase, where the numbers are presented and participants calculate the result according to the instructions.
In addition, half of the trials were practiced beforehand, thus allowing us
to distinguish between Instruction and Execution of Novel and Practiced
trials. To isolate regions involved in interpreting instructions, we first
identified all the voxels that were more active during the Execution of
Novel trials than during the Instruction of Novel tasks or the Execution
of Practiced ones. Then, in order to eliminate possible confounds due to
increased access to instructions during execution, the results were
masked by a parametric image of voxels more active in the Instruction
phase for Novel than for Practiced tasks (p < 0.05, uncorrected). Only
two clusters remained, corresponding to the right and left basal ganglia.
Thus, our results indicate that the basal ganglia are crucially involved in
interpreting and instantiating abstract rules. This function is consistent
with existing models of the circuit's computations, and sheds new light
on the neural basis of human intelligence.

A DEVELOPMENTAL FMRI STUDY ON CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING:
HIGH POTENTIALS OF THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN (GSP WINNER) Sietske
Kleibeuker1, Cédric Koolschijn1, Dietsje Jolles1, Serge Rombouts1, Carsten De
Dreu2, Eveline Crone1,2; 1Leiden University, Netherlands, 2University of
Amsterdam, Netherlands — Adolescence is a period in life associated with

advancements in reasoning but also high flexibility in the ability to think
creatively. Structural and functional imaging studies demonstrated nonlinear developmental changes in prefrontal and parietal cortex regions,
indicative of slowly maturing cognitive control functions. The goal of the
current study was to test the hypothesis that these adolescent specific
changes in brain structure and function potentiate creative processes
through more widely distributed activation within late developing association areas. Functional imaging data of 24 adolescents (15-17 yrs) and
12 adults (25-30 yrs) were collected during a modified version of Goel &
Vartanian’s (2005) Match-Problem task. Experimental trials required
hypothesis generation and mental set-shifting, important processes in
creative problem solving. Control trials required evaluation of hypothetical solutions. Adolescents performed slightly more accurate than adults,
specifically on experimental trials (p=.05). These behavioral results were

24

associated with increased activation of frontal areas in the adolescent
brain. Relative to control trials (C), experimental trials (E) were associated with activation in left Inferior Frontal Gyrus across all participants,
but activation was larger for adolescents compared to adults. Additionally, adolescents showed bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
activation. ROI analyses for E>C on right DLPFC, previously associated
with task-performance on the Match-Problem task, confirmed elevated
activation for adolescents relative to adults. A positive correlation
between performance and activation for correct>incorrect on experimental trials confirmed the role of this region in creative processing. In all,
this study underscores the potential of the developing adolescent brain
in creative problem solving.

STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY IN A FRONTO-PARIETAL
NETWORK WITH REASONING TRAINING Allyson Mackey1, Kirstie J.

Whitaker1, Alison Miller-Singley1, Carter Wendelken1, Silvia A. Bunge1;

University of California, Berkeley — Neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated the involvement of a fronto-parietal network in reasoning ability. We hypothesized that reasoning training would involve
repeated use of this network, leading to changes in its structure and
function. Rather than designing an artificial training program, we chose
to study individuals while they prepared for the Law School Admissions
Test (LSAT), a test that places strong demands on reasoning skills. We
recruited students who were taking an LSAT course that offers 100 hours
of instruction (n=25), as well as age- and IQ-matched pre-law controls
(n=12). All subjects participated in two scanning sessions 90 days apart.
We collected behavioral and fMRI data for a transitive inference task as
well as structural MRI and DTI scans. The LSAT group improved significantly more than controls on the transitive inference task, both in accuracy (p<.05) and response times (p<.05), and exhibited a significantly
greater task-related increase in bilateral superior parietal lobule activation from time 1 to time 2 than did controls (p<.05). The LSAT group also
showed a decrease in left middle frontal gyrus (p<.05), but this change
was not significantly different than for controls. Our DTI analyses
focused on the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), which connects
prefrontal and parietal cortices. Interestingly, the LSAT group, but not
controls, exhibited a decrease in fractional anisotropy in left SLF. In summary, we found that preparation for the LSAT improves performance,
boosts parietal activation during a transitive inference task, and alters
the white matter pathway connecting prefrontal and parietal cortices.

concerning social organisation and human relations centre on morality
and altruism. While moral choices in the real world are highly susceptible to pressures of both context and consequence, little research has
examined real moral decision-making; instead, research has focused on
hypothetical moral reasoning. Consequently, little is known about
behavioural responses to real moral challenges and how the brain processes these decisions. Here we show that hypothetical moral decisions
do not approximate real moral action and that real moral decisions
recruit distinct neural circuitry. Under both real and hypothetical condi-

tions, we measured subjects’ responses when deciding between financial
self benefit versus preventing physical harm to a confederate. In a behavioural study, we found that subjects dramatically prioritise their own
financial benefit at the expense of harming others, keeping over three
times as much for themselves in the real task as compared to the hypothetical. In two functional magnetic resonance studies, we showed that
decisions made under hypothetical conditions activated neural networks
identified in the existing literature, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—a region also implicated in imagination. However, decisions
made during the real condition activated these networks as well as additional regions in the posterior and middle insular cortex (pINS-mINS)—
areas essential in integrating affective body states to create a preliminary
neural template of subjective feelings. We conclude that the pINS-mINS
activity provides a rudimentary marker for real moral decisions.

UNDERSTANDING THE MENTAL AND MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF
ACTIONS VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE: EFFECTS OF LEVEL OF CONSTRUAL
AND ACTION VISIBILITY ON THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF SOCIAL
COGNITION Robert Spunt1, Matthew Lieberman1; 1University of California,
Los Angeles — Actions can be construed as a sequence of mechanical
interactions with the physical world (how it is occurring) or as the
expression of the motives, beliefs and intentions of the actor (why it is
occurring). We have shown that mental and mechanical construals of
actions described in text engage dissociable neural systems (Spunt, Falk
& Lieberman, 2010), with mechanical construals engaging a left-lateralized set of higher-order visual and premotor areas associated with representing motor actions, and mental construals engaging a diffuse network
of regions associated with representing mental states, including medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), precuneus, and the temporoparietal junction.
In the present study, we investigated how action construal and action
visibility interactively modulate these neural systems. Twenty-one participants underwent fMRI while being presented with video clips of
actions (action visible) and descriptions of action intentions (invisible
action; e.g., “She is marking her calendar”). For each presentation, participants identified either why (mental construal) or how (mechanical construal) the action was being performed. Regardless of action visibility,
mental construals engaged areas supporting mental state representation,
while mechanical construals engaged areas supporting visual/motor
representation. Regardless of level of construal, visible actions engaged a
primarily right-lateralized set of areas for motor representation. We
observed interaction effects in left-lateralized areas for motor representation, and in areas important for social cognition, including the mPFC,
medial temporal cortex (including amygdala), and temporal poles. The
results demonstrate an imperative to consider effects of both stimulus
(bottom-up) and construal (top-down) on the neural systems supporting
social cognition.

SEPARATE BRAIN REGIONS RESPOND TO OTHERS’ PHYSICAL PAIN AND
EMOTIONAL SUFFERING Emile
Bruneau1,
Rebecca
Saxe1;
1Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Witnessing the aftermath of a

disaster, we feel empathic responses towards the physical pain of the
victims, and towards the emotional suffering of the survivors mourning
the loss of loved ones and livelihoods. While many recent studies have
investigated the neural mechanisms of responding to another person’s
physical pain, how the brain processes another’s emotional suffering is
less well understood. In the current study we presented participants
(n=42) with 144 verbal scenarios, each describing a protagonist’s physical or emotional experience, ranging from neutral to extremely negative
events. A separate group of participants read these scenarios, and rated
them on multiple scales, including “how much physical pain”, and “how
much emotional suffering” the protagonist experienced. A whole-brain
item analysis was used to determine which brain regions’ responses
were correlated, across items, with these ratings. Although ratings of
Pain and Suffering were positively correlated, they revealed activity in
distinct brain regions. Stories that described more physical pain elicited
neural activity in brain regions associated with feeling physical sensations (e.g. secondary sensory cortices) and in experiencing physical pain

(e.g. insula and dorsal cingulate cortices). By contrast, stories that
described more emotional suffering elicited activity in a subset of
regions associated with thinking about other people’s minds: posterior
cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. More broadly, item analyses
with continuous predictors provided a high-powered method for identifying brain regions associated with specific aspects of complex stimuli –
like verbal descriptions of physical and emotional events.

SOCIAL INFLUENCE MODULATES THE NEURAL COMPUTATION OF
VALUE Jamil Zaki1, Jason Mitchell1; 1Department of Psychology, Harvard
University — Social influence—individuals’ tendency to conform to the
beliefs and attitudes of others—has interested psychologists for decades.
However, it has traditionally been difficult to distinguish true modification of one’s attitudes from mere public compliance with social norms.
That is, individuals may conform publicly to group attitudes in order to
avoid ostracism, while maintaining a different opinion in private, or they
may actually shift their internal perceptions to match those of a group.
Although these are fundamentally different mechanisms through which
social influence could operate, it is difficult to distinguish between them
using behavioral data alone. The current study addressed this challenge
using functional neuroimaging. Participants rated the attractiveness of
faces and subsequently learned how their peers rated each face. Participants were then scanned using fMRI while they rated each face a second
time. These second ratings were influenced by social norms, such that
participants changed their ratings to conform to those of their peers.
Importantly, this social influence was accompanied by modulated
engagement of two brain regions associated with coding subjective
value?the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex?suggesting that
social norms affected the underlying neural representation of value
assigned to stimuli. This converging evidence suggests that social influence is sufficient to cause core modifications of the value assigned to a
stimulus. More broadly, these findings document the underlying neural
changes associated with social influence on individuals’ private evaluations, and elucidate the mechanisms through which the beliefs and attitudes of one person come to shape the mind of another.

NEURAL MEDIATORS OF SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER GENE EFFECTS ON
SMOKING CESSATION. Agnes Jasinska1, Hannah Faye Chua1, S. Shaun
Ho1, Thad A. Polk1, Laura Rozek1, Mike Angstadt1, Victor J. Strecher1;

1University of Michigan — Growing evidence from imaging genetics sug-

gests that serotonin transporter gene variation modulates activity and
connectivity in the amygdala–prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuit during
emotion processing and in affective disorders. The goal of the current
study was to determine whether serotonin transporter gene variation
also modulates the amygdala-PFC circuit response to smoking-cessation
messages in smokers, and whether this response serves as a mediator of
genetic effects on smoking cessation. We used functional MRI to assess
the neural response to smoking-cessation messages compared to neutral
messages in 91 smokers who subsequently underwent a message-based
smoking-cessation intervention. Participants were genotyped for two
common, functional polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene: 5HTTLPR/ rs25531 in the promoter and STin2 in intron 2. The quitting
outcome was assessed 4 months after the intervention, yielding 45 Quitters and 39 Non-Quitters. As predicted, the right amygdala response to
smoking-cessation messages was modulated by both STin2 and 5HTTLPR/ rs25531. Furthermore, amygdala activity mediated the effect
of STin2 on quitting. In addition, functional connectivity between right
amygdala and right ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) during processing of
smoking-cessation messages also mediated STin2 effects on quitting.
Together, these results demonstrate that the amygdala-PFC circuit
response to smoking-cessation messages mediates the impact of serotonin transporter gene variation on smoking cessation.

THE INTRINSIC REWARD VALUE OF COMMUNICATING ABOUT THE SELF

Humans communicate about themselves quite often, and to a wide
range of audiences. Why do humans so readily reveal their thoughts and

Slide Sessions
feelings with others? Using behavioral and functional neuroimaging
measures of reward, here we test the prediction that people communicate with others about the self because doing so provides intrinsic
rewards. In experiment one, participants made a series of choices to
answer questions about the Self, Others, or Facts for money. By comparing participants’ choices to answer one question type over another at a
variety of monetary values, results showed that participants attribute the
greatest monetary value to answering about the Self. In experiments two
and three, participants answered questions about the personality or preferences of themselves and another person during fMRI scanning; in
experiment three, half of participants’ answers were shared with a friend
sitting outside the scanner, half were kept private. Using both wholebrain random effects analyses and ROI analyses of independently localized regions implicated in reward processing (NAcc, VTA, OFC) we contrasted Self>Other trials and Share>Private trials to test for the reward of
self and the reward of sharing information with others. Results revealed
that neural reward activity was significantly greater for answering questions about the self than about others, and that sharing responses—about
both self and other—is significantly more rewarding than responding
privately. Together, these findings suggest that the human tendency to
communicate about their thoughts and feelings may arise, in part, from
the intrinsic value of thinking and sharing about the self.

THE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY OF THE COGNITIVE CONTROL OF
EMOTION Jennifer Silvers1, Jocelyn Shu1, Walter Mischel1, Kevin Ochsner1;
1Columbia University — While adolescence is commonly characterized as a

time of social and emotional turmoil, it is unknown whether shifts in
socio-emotional behavior in adolescence are due to changes in emotional
reactivity or regulation. Study 1 investigated this question by assessing
the behavioral correlates of emotional distancing and immersion in individuals ages 10-22. On each trial, participants viewed an aversive or neutral image while either drawing themselves closer to the emotional
details of the picture (“close” trials) or mentally distancing themselves
from such details (“far” trials). Half of the pictures depicted social and
half depicted non-social content. At the conclusion of each trial, participants rated their negative affect. Self-reported affect on baseline “close”
trials measuring emotional reactivity did not vary with age. However,
whereas all ages reported significantly less negative affect on “far” trials
than “close” trials, regulation success (drops in negative affect) increased
linearly with age. Importantly, age-related differences in regulation success were largest for trials with social stimuli. In Study 2, this same paradigm was used in an fMRI experiment. Results paralleled those of Study
1 in that age predicted larger decreases in amygdala activity on “far” trials in comparison to “close” trials but did not predict baseline reactivity
to aversive images. These age-related differences in amygdala responsivity were greatest for trials containing social content. Differences in
amygdala modulation were accompanied by developmental differences
in recruitment of prefrontal regions known to support emotion regulation. These results suggest that emotional reactivity does not change
during adolescence but that regulatory capacity does.

Sciences — Understanding the aetiology of complex human behaviors,
such as emotion and psychopathology, requires accounting for genetic
and environmental influences at multiple phenotypic levels, including
activity within brain regions associated with emotion processing. Cultural factors, such as individualistic and collectivistic values, affect how
people perceive, experience and respond to emotional events, facilitating
a diverse array of adaptive behavioral repertoires for navigating the
social and physical environment. Yet, how cultural values of individualism-collectivism affect neurobiological mechanisms underlying emotion
remains unknown. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging

26

(fMRI) studies, we investigated the effect of cultural values of individualism-collectivism on human amygdala response to emotional scenes.
Here we show that people living in a collectivistic culture, such as Japan,
demonstrate greater bilateral amygdala response to emotional scenes
compared to people living in an individualistic culture, such as the
United States, controlling for other known modulators of amygdala
response, including ethnicity, personality and serotonin genotype. We
also show that bicultural individuals living in the United States primed
with collectivistic cultural orientation exhibit greater bilateral amygdala
response to emotional scenes compared to biculturals primed with an
individualistic cultural orientation, indicating a causal influence of culture on emotional neural circuitry. Finally, we show that degree of cultural priming positively correlates with degree of amygdala response to
emotional scenes. Taken together, these findings illustrate culturallydriven variation in amygdala response underlying emotion across
macro- and micro-timescales and provide an empirical foundation for
incorporating cultural values of individualism-collectivism into gene-byenvironment models of emotion and psychopathology and their underlying neural substrates.

THE FLEXIBILITY OF INDIVIDUATION IN MULTIPLE OBJECT
PROCESSING Veronica Mazza1,2, Alfonso Caramazza1,3; 1Center for Mind/

Brain Sciences (CIMeC), University of Trento, Italy, 2Department of Cognitive
Sciences and Education, University of Trento, Italy, 3Department of Psychology,
Harvard University — The ability to process concurrently multiple visual

objects is fundamental for a coherent perception of the world. A core
component of this ability is the simultaneous individuation of multiple
objects. Many studies have addressed the mechanism of object individuation but it remains unknown whether the visual system mandatorily
individuates all potentially relevant elements in the visual field, or
whether object indexing depends on task demands. We used an EventRelated Potential (ERP) measure of visual selection, the N2pc component, to evaluate the flexibility of multiple object individuation. In three
ERP experiments, participants saw a variable number (0, 1, 2, 3) of target
elements among homogenous distracters and performed either an enumeration task (Experiment 1) or a detection task, reporting whether at
least one (Experiment 2) or a specified number of target elements (Experiment 3) was present. While in the enumeration task the N2pc response
increased as a function of the number of targets, no such modulation was
found in Experiment 2, indicating that individuation of multiple targets
is not mandatory. However, a modulation of the N2pc similar to the enumeration task was visible in Experiment 3, further highlighting that
object individuation is a flexible mechanism that binds indexes to object
properties and locations as needed for further object processing.

FLEXIBLE VISUAL PROCESSING OF SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS

Steven
Franconeri1, Jason Scimeca1, Jessica Roth1, Lauren Kahn1, Sarah Helseth1;
1Northwestern — Many visual tasks, such as understanding a diagram,
require that we process the spatial relationships between objects. There
is almost no work exploring how we make these judgments in a flexible
way. One hurdle is the binding problem - because our object recognition
network codes object features across large regions of the visual field,
there is often uncertainty about the location of any given object. Unless
individual objects are isolated by selective attention, object identities can

Slide Sessions
become misbound. We demonstrate examples of this phenomenon for
simple displays containing just two colors. When we process a relative
spatial relation, the visual system may solve this binding problem by
selecting the first object, encoding its location into memory, select the
second object, and then compare its relative location. In three studies, we
used an electrophysiological correlate of selection (N2pc) to demonstrate
that even when dealing with just two simple objects, selection shifts
sequentially between them. These shifts (1) occur despite difficult dual
tasks that discourage them, (2) occur only for trials where the relation
was actually perceived, and (3) do not occur for same-different judgment
tasks that do not present a binding problem. Together, these results demonstrate that when seeing one object to the right of another, our impression of simultaneously selecting both objects may be an illusion. We will
describe a potential architecture that allows recovery of spatial relations
from the pattern of shifts themselves, as show how this flexible processing system could be extended into non-spatial domains (e.g. size judgments).

RETINOTOPIC BUT NOT OBJECTOTOPIC REFERENCE FRAMES DURING
ATTENTIONAL MONITORING Alejandro Vicente-Grabovetsky1, Daniel J.
Mitchell1, Johan D. Carlin1, Rhodri Cusack1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain
Sciences Unit — Spatial coding has been explored in the occipital, parietal

and frontal cortex using retinotopic mapping (Wandell et al, 2007),
which reveals hemifield maps centred onto an egocentric, eye-centred
reference frame. However, little research has been done on other reference frames, which may be non-lateralised and allocentric. Specifically,
we are interested in object-centred reference frames, given the body of
literature addressing object-based hemispatial neglect (Walker, 1995).
We use a novel technique to independently extract Multi-Voxel Pattern
(MVP) information related to eye-centred (retinotopic) and object-centred (objectotopic) frames of reference. Implementing this technique, we
designed a selective attention experiment requiring participants to detect
changes in velocity in specific moving gratings belonging to one of two
discs, each located left or right of fixation. Since the targets were defined
by colour, the task requirements did not specifically necessitate either a
retinotopic or objectotopic reference frame. Our results revealed that
while retinotopic spatial information was automatically evoked across
the occipital and posterior parietal cortex, objectotopic information was
absent. This dissociation confirms that retinotopic reference frames are
automatically engaged during attentional monitoring, and suggests several possibilities for objectotopic reference frames. Perhaps objectotopic
reference frames are only engaged by specific task requirements. Alternatively, interhemispheric reference frames may not exist, given separate attentional resources for each visual hemifield as shown cognitively
(Alvarez and Cavanagh, 2005) and the relative hemispheric independence shown in our univariate results. One final possibility considers
how visual stimuli are defined as objects and parts thereof, and the
implication of this in objectotopy studies.

THE MICROGENESIS OF OBJECT-BASED VIS-À-VIS SPACE-BASED
VISUAL ATTENTION Linda Moya1, Sarah Shomstein2, Anto Bagic3, Marlene
Behrmann1; 1Carnegie Mellon University, 2George Washington University,

3University of Pittsburgh Medical Center — Visual attention can be under-

stood as the process by which some subset of the input is selected for further cognitive processing. One way of processing input is to attend to a
spatial location unbiased by the elements that comprise the input.
Another way is to attend to an entire perceptual object and process it
preferentially. The former is known as space-based attention (SBA) and
the latter as object-based attention (OBA). Recent theories suggest that
attention is a basic computational mechanism in which dynamic networks of oscillating neurons are formed to subserve cognition via critical
and differential contribution of oscillation frequency. An open question
is how the dynamic networks of these two forms of attention differ. The
present research utilizes a classic behavioral paradigm for uncovering
effects as evidenced by reaction time differences. Simultaneously, MEG,
EEG and MRI neuroimaging are used to elucidate how OBA vis-à-vis
SBA evolves in time, across the brain, while elucidating the frequency

characteristics. Our results suggest that OBA and SBA are processed differentially first in the parietal lobes starting at 50 ms post target onset,
then follow a feedback, feedforward then posterior ventral-lateral time
course through 300 ms. Left-hemifield targets start and finish differential
processing before right-hemifield targets. Finally, differential processing
happens within the theta and alpha frequency bands. The present findings lay the groundwork for further research into a comprehensive temporal and spatial understanding of the role of the frontal-parietal areas
as the source of OBA vis-à-vis SBA and their modulation of posterior
brain regions.

DISTINCT ANATOMY FOR VISUAL SEARCH AND BISECTION: A
NEUROIMAGING STUDY Kathleen Pirog Revill1, Hans-Otto Karnath1,2,

Christopher Rorden1; 1Georgia Institute of Technology, 2University of
Tübingen — Individuals with spatial neglect following brain injury often
show biased performance on landmark bisection tasks (judging if a single item is transected at its midpoint) and search tasks (where they seek
target(s) from an array of items). Interestingly, it appears that bisection
deficits dissociate from other measures of neglect (including search
tasks), and neglect patients with bisection deficits typically have more
posterior injury than those without these symptoms. While previous
studies in healthy adults have examined each of these tasks independently, our aim was to directly contrast brain activity between these two
tasks. Our design used displays that were interpreted as landmark bisection stimuli in some blocks of trials and as search arrays on other trials so
that low level perceptual and motor responses were identical across
tasks. Both tasks generated significant activity in bilateral midfusiform
gyrus, largely right lateralized activity in the posterior parietal cortex,
left lateralized activity in the left motor cortex (consistent with right
handed response) and generally right lateralized insular activation. Several brain areas showed task-selective activations when the two tasks
were directly compared. Specifically, the superior parietal cortex was
selectively activated during the landmark task. On the other hand, the
search task caused stronger bilateral activation in the anterior insula,
along with midfusiform gyrus, medial superior frontal areas, thalamus
and right putamen. This work demonstrates that healthy adults show an
anatomical dissociation for visual search and bisection behavior similar
to that reported in neurological patients, and provides coordinates for
future brain stimulation studies.

THE ROLE OF LOW FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS ON MOTOR
PROGRAMMING AND UPDATING (GSP WINNER) Andre Mascioli Cravo1,

Gustavo Rohenkohl2, Valentin Wyart2, Anna C. Nobre2; 1Department of
Physiology and Biophysics, University of São Paulo, 2Department of
Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford — The ability to program and

continuously update motor actions for forthcoming events is essential
for behaviour. In humans, several studies have associated increasing
temporal expectations with synchronization of higher frequency oscillations (i.e. gamma band) and suppression of lower frequencies that are
thought to be detrimental to sensory processing. In this experiment, we
explore a novel hypothesis that proposes that low-frequency oscillations
can provide a central mechanism for temporal expectations. We used a
Go/No-go reaction time task where temporal expectations were manipulated by the probability of target presentation after certain intervals. As
expected, we found that reactions times decreased with higher temporal
expectations. Interestingly, the difference in RT happened in the same
time periods where there was an increase of frontal-midline theta. Moreover, we found a transient phase-power coupling between theta phase
and beta power in time periods where the temporal expectations were
not fulfilled. Taken together, our results support the idea that low-frequency oscillations provide a central mechanism for temporal expectations, and that phase-power coupling between frequencies can work as a
temporally specific mechanism to coordinate activity across distributed
cortical areas.

regional scale the brain is organized into dynamic functional networks,
one of which, the default network, is anticorrelated with other transient,
task-specific networks. Putatively the default network manages a variety
of cognitive background processes, such as using experience-informed
simulations to help predict and plan for the future. One hypothesis
about how such always-structurally-connected networks can transiently
form and dissolve functionally, is that network formation and dissolution is mediated by increases and decreases in oscillatory synchronization between constituent brain regions. If so, then synchronization
within the default network also should be anticorrelated with synchronization within task-specific networks. In order to investigate this hypothesis we conducted two experiments in which participants engaged in a
Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) while having brain activity recorded via high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We found
that during periods when attention was focused internally there was significantly more neural phase synchrony between brain regions associated with the default network, whereas during periods when subjects
were focused on performing the visual task there was significantly more
neural phase synchrony within a complementary task-specific brain network. This anticorrelated network synchrony occurred in each of theta,
alpha, and gamma frequency bands. A similar pattern of anticorrelated
oscillatory power changes, indicating modulation of local synchronization by attention state, was also found. These results provide additional
evidence that the human brain is intrinsically organized into anticorrelated default and task-specific brain networks, and confirm that synchronization is a potential mechanism for functional coupling within these
networks.

suggest that
craving triggered by drug cue exposure results in part from abnormal
allocation of attention to drug cues in substance-dependent individuals
(SDIs). In a previous fMRI study measuring attentional bias toward
smoking-related images, we found differences between smokers and
non-smokers in responses to smoking cues and smoking congruent targets in areas implicated in attention, cognitive control, and episodic
memory. Using the same paradigm, here we tested whether predictors
of addiction severity predict brain responses to smoking cues. First,
regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between attentional
bias and cue responses in a network of frontal areas including the orbital
frontal cortex, as well as the caudal hippocampus. Second, we compared
the neural correlates of attentional bias between participants with differing genetic risk for nicotine dependence severity. We genotyped participants for the C>T exon 5 polymorphism (rs1044396) of the gene
encoding the ?4 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(CHRNA4). Participants with the CC genotype, associated with nicotine
dependence risk, showed significant attentional bias toward cigarette
cues, while T-allele carriers did not. CC’s had increased precuneus, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal activity in response to smoking-congruent probes and increased activation in cerebellum, ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex, previously implicated in executive dysfunction among SDIs, in response to smoking cues. In contrast,
TT’s showed greater activity in response to smoking-congruent probes
in the anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting enhanced cognitive control
when distracting smoking cues should be ignored. Results provide novel
biomarkers of genetic contribution to addiction-related attentional bias.

SENSORY AND SEMANTIC SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN THE ANTERIOR
TEMPORAL LOBES. Laura Skipper1, Lars Ross1, Ingrid Olson1; 1Temple
University — In the semantic memory literature the anterior temporal lobe
(ATL) is frequently discussed as one homogeneous region when in fact,
anatomical studies indicate that it is likely that there are discrete subregions within this area. Here we used functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether sensory and stimulus-specific
subregions exist within the ATL. Participants were trained to associate
social or non-social words with novel auditory, visual, or audiovisual
stimuli. Participants then underwent an fMRI scan, during which stimuli
was presented and participants were required to recall the associated
words. We found that visual stimuli preferentially activated ventral
ATL, and that multisensory stimuli preferentially activated polar aspects
of the ATL. We also found relatively more sensitivity in the ATL to the
retrieval of social knowledge as compared to non-social knowledge,
especially in polar regions, and that this factor interacted with sensory
modality. These findings indicate that the ATL contains subdivisions
based on sensory modality, and that the semantic processing capacities
of this region, especially the temporal pole, are strongly biased towards
social stimuli.

MANY PROCESSES LEAD TO RECOGNITION: ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL
CORRELATES OF FAMILIARITY DERIVED FROM SHORT-TERM MASKED
REPETITION Heather D. Lucas1, Ken A. Paller1; 1Northwestern University —
Multiple forms of memory can occur simultaneously, including explicit
familiarity and implicit priming. Explicit memory and priming are often
considered to be independent of each other. However, some evidence
suggests that repetition-related increases in processing fluency thought
to give rise to priming may also contribute to familiarity. To investigate
these issues further, we examined brain potentials during a recognition
test for visual words. Fluency was selectively enhanced for half of the
test cues via masked repetition. As expected, the proportion of words
endorsed as “old” was greater for words immediately preceded by a
matching masked word versus a random one. Also, N400 potentials
were reduced for words preceded by matching versus random masked
words. Most importantly, N400 reductions were larger for unstudied
items falsely endorsed as “old” relative to correct rejections. These
potentials were distinct from electrophysiological correlates of successful recognition of studied words. These findings suggest that the relationship between familiarity and priming is not immutable. Here,
masked-repetition-induced fluency served as a cue to prior experience,
in that words made more fluent in this manner engendered more familiarity in the recognition test. The electrophysiological results challenge
conventional assumptions that patterns of neural activity that covary
with explicit recognition cannot reflect priming. In some cases, the extent
to which an item's fluency increases from a prior exposure impacts the
likelihood that it will be experienced as familiar. More generally, experiences of familiarity can stem from multiple sources and can have different neural correlates depending on the sources that are operative.

event, or on the basis of familiarity. Recollection is often operationalized
either as the ability to make accurate source memory judgments (i.e.,
retrieving where or how an item was studied), or with a dual process
model in which recollection reflects a threshold process that supports
relatively high confidence item recognition responses, but not less confident memories. In general, studies using these approaches have led to
convergent results. However, subjects sometimes make accurate source
memory judgments even for items that don't receive the highest level of
item recognition confidence, and its not clear whether these types of
responses are based on recollection or familiarity. To address this, we
measured event related potentials (ERPs) during item and source memory confidence judgments. In line with previous studies, recognition was
associated with an early fronto-central positivity and a later left parietal
positivity, which have been previously associated with familiarity and
recollection, respectively. The fronto-central effect increased gradually
with item recognition confidence, whereas the left parietal component
was only observed for highly confident recognition responses. The left
parietal effect was also related to source accuracy, but only for items that
had received a high confidence item recognition response; accurate
source judgments to items that were less confidently recognized did not
exhibit this ERP correlate of recollection. Results indicate that recollection supports high confidence recognition responses and accurate source
judgments, but that familiarity may support accurate source judgments
when recollection fails.

A COMMON NEURAL SYSTEM MEDIATES ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE BY
PERCEPTS AND INTRUSIVE MEMORIES Benjamin J. Levy1, Ean

Huddleston2, Michael C. Anderson2; 1Stanford University, 2MRC Cognition and
Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge England — Functional imaging studies of
episodic memory reveal the consistent recruitment of lateral parietal cortex (LPC) during retrieval (Wagner et al., 2005). It has been suggested
(Cabeza et al., 2008; Ciaremelli et al., 2008) that the specific LPC regions
recruited during retrieval may be related to a distinction within spatial
attention between the dorsal and ventral attention networks (Corbetta &
Shulman, 2002), although this position has been challenged (Hutchinson
et al., 2009; Sestieri et al., 2010). Here we provide a novel contribution to
this discussion based on evidence from the Think/No-Think paradigm.
In this paradigm subjects attempt to intentionally prevent a specific
memory from entering conscious awareness, however, in current task
we have them report when an unwanted memory intrudes into awareness and reflexively captures mnemonic attention. Across multiple
experiments, we find a replicable region of right ventral LPC that is
recruited when people experience these mnemonic intrusions, independent of the type of material that intrudes (words, faces, places). We also
demonstrate that, within-subject, this cluster overlaps with the regions
observed during the reflexive allocation of spatial allocation, as measured by the Posner cueing task, although there also appears to be
regions of functional differentiation within LPC between mnemonic and
perceptual capture. Lastly, we find a similar activation even when subjects are not asked to report the occurrence of intrusions, suggesting that
this finding is not due to the monitoring component of the task. Instead,
this suggests common neural responses during reflexive orienting of
attention to either percepts or memories.

contribute differently to internal mentation (Andrews-Hanna et al.,
2010). Three experiments were conducted to explore the contributions of
the DN components to episodic memory (EM) and theory of mind

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

(TOM). In Experiment 1, 36 participants were scanned with fMRI while
performing a “remember/know” memory retrieval task and a “false
belief” TOM task. The posterior cingulate was similarly engaged during
both tasks, while the two subsystems were differentially engaged. EM
preferentially recruited a medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem that
included the hippocampal formation, parahippocampal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and posterior inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, TOM
recruited a dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPC) subsystem that
included the dMPFC, temporoparietal junction, and temporal poles. In
Experiment 2, resting state functional connectivity was used to examine
spontaneous correlations among these regions, replicating the pattern of
convergence and divergence observed in Experiment 1. Experiment 3
used a novel “Lexical Brain Decoding” approach (Yarkoni et al., submitted) to identify brain regions that most strongly predicted the presence
of EM and TOM in a large-scale meta-analysis of the fMRI literature.
Results linked EM to the MTL subsystem and TOM to the dMPFC subsystem. Collectively, these results suggest the DN is comprised of a heterogeneous brain system that involves distinct subsystems with
functionally dissociable roles.

EXPLAINING THE ROLE OF DEFAULT MODE NETWORK SUPPRESSION IN
SUCCESSFUL COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE: EFFECTS OF RESPIRATION

Martin Vinck5, Winnie Hofman6, Willem Huijbers7; 1University of Amsterdam,
Netherlands, 2Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland — The default mode

network (DMN) regions are deactivated during cognitive tasks as a function of task demands and these deactivations are associated with successful performance. Yet, it is largely unknown why this happens. One
intriguing possibility is that the link between DMN deactivation and
successful cognitive performance is mediated by changes in respiration,
which have been found to track changes in attention and to confound
changes in fMRI signal. We investigated this hypothesis within the
domain of episodic memory encoding, focusing on the posterior medial
component (PMC) of the default network. Several studies found that
PMC deactivation during encoding predicts later memory. Thus, in contrast with regions like left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), which
typically show greater activity for subsequently remembered than forgotten items (subsequent memory effect—SME), PMC shows the opposite pattern (reverse SME). To investigate if reverse SME in PMC is
related to respiratory artefacts, we measured respiration in the scanner
and included a breath-holding condition. We found that respiration predicted subsequent memory performance, and that the reverse SME effect
in PMC was substantially reduced during breath-holding. In contrast,
left VLPFC did not show this effect. A correlation analysis confirmed
these last findings. . These findings suggest that the link between DMN
deactivation and successful cognitive performance is partly related to
changes in respiration, which in turn may track differences in attention.
Further research is required to extend our findings to other DMN components and cognitive domains and to explore the links between respiration and attention.

SLEEP'S ROLE IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF EMOTIONAL EPISODIC
MEMORIES Jessica Payne1, Elizabeth Kensinger2; 1University of Notre

Dame, 2Boston College — After information is encoded into memory, it
undergoes an offline period of consolidation that may occur optimally
during sleep. Here we show that sleep can have highly selective effects
on emotional memory consolidation. Compared to periods of wakefulness, sleep preferentially preserves emotionally salient aspects of complex experiences at the expense of less salient, neutral aspects. We
provide evidence that 1) compared to two different wake control conditions (designed to strictly control for circadian and interference confounds), a brief afternoon nap is sufficient to trigger the preferential
enhancement of emotional components of complex scenes, and further,
this enhancement is correlated with time spent in deep, slow-wave sleep
(SWS), 2) this preferential enhancement is further intensified across
longer (24hr and 3month) delays, but only when sleep directly follows
encoding. Across these longer delays, emotional object memories con-

tinue to be protected (i.e. they do not deteriorate further), but there is
additional, perhaps active, suppression of memory for associated backgrounds, suggesting that additional nights of sleep might continue to
sculpt the memory trace. Finally, 3) using fMRI, we show that a single
night of sleep can provoke changes in the emotional-memory circuitry
used at retrieval, leading to increased activity within the amygdala and
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and resulting in strengthened connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus and ventromedial
prefrontal cortex. These findings strongly suggest that sleep-specific
brain physiology plays a specialized role in memory consolidation,
going beyond simple stabilization of memories to promote changes in
memory representation that may be highly adaptive.

DIRECTING SLEEP TO SELECTIVELY FORGET AND REMEMBER HUMAN
MEMORIES (GSP WINNER) Jared Saletin1, Andrea Goldstein1, Matthew

Walker1; 1University of California, Berkeley — Substantive evidence now
implicates sleep in the consolidation and strengthening of human memories. However, numerous circumstances exist where forgetting is as critical as remembering. Here we investigate the impact of explicit cue
instruction during learning, prior to sleep, on the subsequent remembering and forgetting, after sleep. At the initial learning phase at 11:00, participants (n=46) were presented with 100 words one at a time. Each word
was followed by a cue to either forget or remember that word. Following
learning, half of the participants (“Nap-group”) were then given a 100minute sleep opportunity, while the other half (“No-Nap-group”)
remained awake. At 17:15, all subjects were then given a surprise freerecall memory test. A significant group by cue-type recall interaction
was observed (P=0.004), such that those in the nap-group, relative to the
no-nap group, showed a preferential recall of words cued to be remembered, yet this benefit occurred in absence of any such enhanced recall of
items cued to be forgotten, indicative of specificity. Moreover, the success of this differential remember/forget effect strongly correlated with
fast sleep-spindles over the left superior parietal cortex (P=0.0006). Further, EEG source analysis of these spindles revealed a repeating loop of
current density between selective memory-related regions of the superior parietal, medial temporal and right prefrontal cortices. These findings move beyond the classical notion of sleep universally strengthening
information. Instead, they suggest a model in which sleep may be more
ecologically attuned to instructions present during learning, supporting
both remembering and targeted forgetting of human memories.

TASK MODULATION OF BRAIN RESPONSES IN VISUAL WORD
RECOGNITION REVEALED BY FMRI AND COMBINED EEG/MEG (GSP
WINNER) Yuanyuan Chen1, Matt Davis1, Friedemann Pulvermüller1, Olaf
Hauk1; 1University of Cambridge — In order to investigate early stimulus-

driven from later decision-related brain responses in visual word recognition, we measured word-evoked brain activity using fMRI and combined EEG/MEG for the same set of words in 3 different tasks: silent
reading (R), lexical decision (LD) and semantic decision (SD). FMRI
results: compared with the corresponding 2 other tasks, SD elicited
stronger activation in left IFG and bilateral mid-temporal; R elicited
stronger activation in parietal lobe; LD showed greater activation in
motor cortex and cerebellum. EEG/MEG results: sensor statistics
revealed comparable activation across tasks until about 150ms, when
task modulation began to occur. Distributed source analysis showed task

30

differences in left posterior mid-temporal, inferior temporal, superior
temporal areas (100ms to 200ms). Task differences in IFG and anterior
mid-temporal cortex were seen in a later time window (250ms to 350ms).
Multiple regression analysis in fMRI showed task modulation of activity
for bi/tri-gram frequency in ventral temporal regions, suggesting that
these ventral temporal regions respond to sublexical information due to
task-specific influences rather than through purely stimulus-driven processing. However in EEG/MEG source activation in this area was similar
across tasks within 500ms after word onset, perhaps indicating that the
early effect was task-independent. These results suggest that task-specific processes penetrate word processing before 200 ms (EEG/MEG).
Although we observed similarities between activation patterns in fMRI
and EEG/MEG source estimation, our results suggest that fMRI is most
sensitive to later post-recognition or decision processes, while EEG/
MEG is sensitive to early word-specific information retrieval.

AUTOMATICITY AND SPEED OF LEXICAL PROCESSING IN THE FIRST AND
SECOND LANGUAGE Emily Coderre1, Walter van Heuven1, Kathy Conklin1;
1The University of Nottingham — Being able to process language quickly is a

vital skill we rely on for human interactions. Electroencephalography
(EEG) research indicates that lexico-semantic information is accessed
within 200 ms (e.g. Dell’Acqua et al., 2007). Lower proficiency in a second language (L2) relative to a first (L1) leads to delays in lexical processing speed in L2, as proposed by the temporal delay assumption of
the BIA+ model (Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002; van Heuven & Dijkstra,
2010). The reduced frequency hypothesis (Pyers et al., 2009) proposes
that the L1 is also delayed due to lower frequency of use relative to
monolinguals The current study investigates these hypotheses in the
context of automatic reading by directly comparing English monolinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals’ L1 and L2 on a Stroop task. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was manipulated to provide further
information on the automaticity of word reading. Word stimuli elicited
an N170 component, which is related to orthographic processing (Bentin
et al., 1999), in all SOAs, indicating automatic lexical processing in all
groups. At the N170 peak, differences emerged between words and control stimuli in monolinguals and bilinguals’ L1, signifying that early lexical processing occurred at the same latency for the native languages
despite large orthographic differences. In bilinguals’ L2, however, word
and control waveforms diverged significantly later, indicating delayed
lexical processing. These results provide neurophysiological evidence
for the temporal delay assumption but not the reduced frequency
hypothesis, and confirm that early lexical processing is automatically
activated but significantly delayed in the second language.

COMPLEX SYNTACTIC PROCESSING IN VERY PROFICIENT NON-NATIVES

Molinaro2, Manuel Carreiras2,3,1; 1University of the Basque Country, 2Basque
Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, 3Ikerbasque Basque Foundation for
Science — Despite the classical Subject Relative clauses (SR) processing
ease, some languages show the reverse pattern. Carreiras et al. (2010)
report that in Basque Object Relatives (ORs) are easier to process than
SRs. Here we report a study on Basque relative clause processing by proficient bilinguals whose native language is Spanish (a language showing
SR advantage). We explored whether nonnatives transfer from Spanish
(L1) and show an advantage for SR, or whether they show the OR advantage of natives. Experiment 1 used a self paced reading task, while ERPs
were recorded in Experiment 2. The materials used were those previously tested by Carreiras et al. Experiment 1 revealed longer reading
times for SR than OR after the critical disambiguating region. Experiment 2 showed larger amplitudes for SR than OR in the N400 component
after reading the critical disambiguating word. These results show that
the OR advantage previously reported in Basque does not vary for proficient nonnatives, even if their native language yields the opposite advantage-pattern for RC processing. Hence, proficient L2 speakers do not
transfer syntactic structures and processing strategies from L1 into L2.
However, a significant difference in the ERP pattern was observed with
respect to to the P600 effect found by Carreiras et al.: nonnative profi-

cient bilinguals showed a N400 effect, rather than a P600 effect. In contrast to theories suggesting that at high proficiency levels nonnative
processing becomes native-like, our findings suggest that nonnatives
rely more on lexical strategies than natives.

RIGHT ARCUATE FASCICULUS PREDICTS ARTIFICIAL GRAMMAR
Loui1,
LEARNING IN MUSIC: A BEHAVIORAL AND DTI STUDY Psyche

Gottfried Schlaug1; 1Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard
Medical School — White matter is important for multiple cognitive
domains including language and learning ability. Learning ability is
often assessed using Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) paradigms.
Although previous literature has linked AGL to Arcuate Fasciculus (AF)
connectivity in the left hemisphere, AGL has been implemented mostly
with linguistic syllables, which are predominantly processed by the left
hemisphere. We ask whether AGL is left-hemisphere-specific, or
whether AGL is linked to the hemisphere that processes materials of the
grammar. Since musical pitch is preferentially processed by the right
hemisphere, a musical AGL study presents an optimal test case for this
question. We acquired diffusion tensor images from participants who
were trained on a musical artificial grammar, and then assessed on generalization (a grammar-learning task). Dorsal and ventral branches of
left and right AF were identified by probabilistic tractography between
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and middle
temporal gyrus (MTG). Correlations were used to test for relationships
between behavior and volumes of each AF branch. Results showed that
right ventral AF was positively correlated to generalization performance. Furthermore, a region in the right ventral AF, in white matter
underlying the temporal-parietal junction, showed FA that correlated
with generalization at the p<0.05 (FWE-corrected) level. Effects were not
attributable to age, IQ, or pitch discrimination. Results provide support
for AGL being subserved by the hemisphere that processes grammatical
stimuli, rather than being a left-hemisphere-specific function. White matter may enable musical AGL by connecting grey matter regions that process pitch to other domain-general cognitive functions.

EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL (ERP) INDICES OF REFERENTIAL
DEPENDENCY FORMATION Chris Barkley1, Robert Kluender1, Marta
Kutas1; 1University of California, San Diego — Previous research suggests

two ERP components relevant to referential processing: referentiallyinduced frontal negativity (Nref) indexing referential ambiguity, and
late positivity indexing referential failure. In this study, we challenge
this characterization by focusing on well-formed unambiguous antecedent-pronoun relations, allowing us to investigate brain responses associated with successful formation of a referential dependency rather than
responses to referential ill-formedness. We hypothesized that phasic left
anterior negativity (LAN) elicited during the processing of these antecedent-pronoun relations indexes retrograde search through working
memory for purposes of accessing the non-local elements necessary to
establish a long-distance dependency. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 26 scalp electrodes while 20 monolingual native
English speakers (aged 18-30) read 200 experimental items and 120 filler
sentences. Experimental sentences contained either pronominal or
proper name main clause subjects that did or did not have coreferents in
preceding adverbial adjuncts. In each comparison, critical positions and
preceding lexical material were identical. Repeated measures ANOVAs
indicated that pronominal subjects with coreferents elicited phasic LAN
between 300 and 500 msec. compared to those without coreferents; this
effect was followed by sustained negativity spanning subsequent word
positions through sentence end. There were no differences between
proper name conditions. These results support our hypothesis that phasic LAN indexes the cognitive processes underlying non-local dependency formation, independent of whether the dependency is syntactic or
referential in nature. The results also necessitate revision of mappings
between observed Nref/late positive effects and underlying cognitive
processes, and of frameworks of the ERP indices of referential processing.

THE INFLUENCE OF CONTEXTUAL CONGRUENCE AND FIGURATIVENESS
ON HEMISPHERIC RECRUITMENT Michele T. Diaz1, Larson J. Hogstrom1;

1Brain Imaging & Analysis Center, Duke University — Although the left hemi-

sphere's prominence in language is well established, less emphasis has
been placed on possible roles for the right hemisphere. Behavioral,
patient, and neuroimaging research suggests that the right hemisphere
may be involved in processing figurative language. Additionally,
research has demonstrated that context can modify language processing
and facilitate comprehension. Here we investigated how figurativeness,
context, and their interaction influenced right hemisphere recruitment.
Previous work in our lab indicated that novel metaphors, familiar metaphors, and novel literal stimuli engaged right inferior frontal gyrus, and
additionally that novel and familiar metaphors engaged right temporal
pole. Some theoretical models (i.e., the Graded Salience Hypothesis)
have proposed that providing a context may ease integration demands
for metaphors, and thereby may reduce right hemisphere recruitment.
functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate neural
function while participants read literal and metaphoric sentences that
were preceded by either a congruent or an incongruent literal sentence.
Consistent with prior research, all sentences engaged traditional left
hemisphere regions. Although differences between metaphors and literal sentences were observed, effects were restricted to the left hemisphere. In contrast to the main effect of figurativeness, a main effect of
congruence was found in right inferior frontal gyrus and right temporal
pole. Our results highlight the influence of context on language processing, demonstrate that additional sentential context mitigated right hemisphere recruitment for metaphors, and show that congruent discourse,
but not figurative language in context, engaged the right hemisphere.

THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON COMICS: THE IMPACT OF STRUCTURE AND
MEANING ON SEQUENTIAL IMAGE COMPREHENSION Neil
Cohn1,

Martin Paczynski1, Phil Holcomb1, Ray Jackendoff1, Gina Kuperberg1; 1Tufts
University — Just as syntax differentiates coherent sentences from scrambled word strings, the comprehension of sequential images must also
use a cognitive system to distinguish coherent narrative sequences from
random strings of images. We conducted experiments analogous to two
classic studies of language processing (1, 2) to examine structure and
semantics in processing sequential images. Using Cohn’s (3) model of
visual narrative, we compared four types of comic strips: 1) Normal
sequences with both structure and meaning, 2) Semantic Only sequences
(semantic relationships but no structure), 3) Structural Only sequences
(structure but no semantic relationships), 4) Scrambled sequences of randomly-ordered panels. In Experiment 1, participants monitored for target panels in sequences presented panel-by-panel. Reaction times were
slowest to panels in Scrambled sequences, intermediate in both Structural Only and Semantic Only sequences, and fastest in Normal
sequences. This suggests that both semantics and structure offer advantages to processing. Experiment 2 measured ERPs to the same target
panels. The largest N400 appeared in both Scrambled and Structural
Only sequences, intermediate in Semantic Only sequences and smallest
in Normal sequences. This implies that a combination of narrative structure and semantic relationships can facilitate semantic processing (as
reflected by the N400). However, the effects of structure alone may be
independent of semantics. Taken together, these findings suggest that
sequential image comprehension uses a grammar that extends beyond
semantic associations between individual frames. The comprehension of
graphic narrative is guided by an interaction between structure and
meaning, akin to that between syntax and semantics in language.

academic benchmarks of childhood, such as IQ, grade retention, and
school graduation rates. Although these outcomes are the direct manifes-

Slide Sessions
tations of brain development, traditionally the study of SES disparities in
child development operated with scarce input from neuroscience.
Recently, a series of studies suggested that socioeconomic disparities
result in specific neurocognitive differences, with large effects in language processing, and smaller but consistent effects in memory and selfregulation. Little is known, however, about the degree to which structural brain differences mediate these effects. Here, structural MRI was
collected on 44 typically developing children ranging in age from 7 to 17.
We used FreeSurfer's automated brain segmentation software (FreeSurfer 4.0.5, http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), to obtain regional cortical volumes, focusing specifically on brain regions known to mediate
language, memory, and self-regulation. Hierarchical regressions reveal
that SES disparities are associated with regional volumetric brain differences in left inferior temporal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala,
adjusting for age, total cerebral cortical volume, gender, and IQ. Further
adjusting for phonological naming eliminates the association between
SES and left inferior temporal cortex volume. SES x age interactions were
found in left fusiform, left middle temporal, and left inferior frontal
regions. Putative mechanistic pathways mediating between SES and specific neurocognitive outcomes are discussed, including linguistic stimulation in the home and chronic stress exposure. Implications for public
health are broad: By targeting the specific neurocognitive systems
affected by SES, we improve our ability to design programs for educational intervention and remediation.

ATYPICAL AUDITORY RESPONSES IN INFANTS AT RISK FOR AUTISM

Jeanne Guiraud1, Przemek Tomalski2, Elena Kushnerenko2, Tony Charman3,
Kim Davies1, Helena Ribeiro1, Leslie Tucker1, Mark H Johnson1; 1Centre for
Brain and Cognitive Development, School of Psychology, Birkbeck, University
of London, UK, 2Institute for Research in Child Development, The University of
East London, London, UK, 3Centre for Research in Autism and Education,
Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education,
London, UK — Autism is a developmental disorder characterised by
unusual sensory responses (Gillberg and Coleman, 2000) and children
with autism are frequently under-reactive and/or hypersensitive to
sounds. This variability in behaviour is reflected in electrophysiological
responses to pitch differences in tones (Ferri et al., 2003; Dunn et al.,
2008). Using electroencephalogaphy, we investigated the neural processing associated with auditory perception in 8-9 month old babies with an
older sibling with autism, and hence at risk of a later diagnosis. We analysed the auditory P150 wave in response to infrequent ‘deviant’‚ 650 Hz
pure tones occasionally placed among repetitive ‘standard’‚ 500 Hz pure
tones using an oddball paradigm in a group of 20 babies at risk and a
matched group of controls (with no relatives with autism). Typically,
controls had a larger P150 amplitude in response to the deviants compared to the standards suggesting that they can perceive the pitch difference between the two tones. However, as a group the babies at risk had a
reduced difference in P150 amplitude. This finding shows evidence for a
neural marker of reduced sound discrimination ability in at least some
infants at risk of developing autism. We will follow up the babies to
determine if this neural marker relates to outcome of autism and/or
auditory dysfunction at 3 years old.

THE BRAIN’S INTERNAL NOISE DETERMINES DISCRIMINATION

Lucas Spierer1; 1Chuv, Lausanne, 2Lausanne University, 3Cibm, Lausanne,
Switzerland, 4Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN — Variation
in stimulus-related behavior and brain responses is commonplace and
typically attributed to the random variability in neural responses (“internal noise”). Computational models indicate that internal noise is sufficient to engender perceptual differences, in turn suggesting that
identical stimuli can be (mis)perceived as being different. In the case of
signal detection theory (SDT), internal noise is quantified as the ratio
between an observer's discrimination threshold and sensitivity (d’). The
present study investigated the contribution of internal noise to conscious
perception and discrimination abilities. Participants were instructed to
indicate which sound of a pair of identical pure tones was of higher
pitch, being unaware that sounds were actually physically identical. In
order to ensure that participants know what pitch differences referred to,
they also underwent an above-threshold frequency discrimination task.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

With the aim to determine whether and how spontaneous activity can
engender different percepts, AEPs to the identical sounds were compared as a function of perceived pitch, yielding a “High perceived pitch”
vs. “Low perceived pitch” design. AEPs modulated topographically 92115ms post-stimulus onset as a function of perceived pitch, indicative of
the engagement of distinct intracranial sources; LAURA source estimations indicated that it followed from a modulation within the left temporo-parietal areas. Activity within this cluster negatively correlated
with the participant's sensitivity in pitch discrimination measured in the
pre-test session. Collectively, our results indicate that the brain’s spontaneous internal noise engenders perception and determines sensitivity.

SHARED TUNING TO PITCH AND SPATIAL LOCATION IN THE HUMAN
AUDITORY CORTEX Talia Shrem1, Leon Y. Deouell1; 1The Hebrew University
of Jerusalem, Israel — The organization of the auditory system is primarily
tonotopic. The representation of acoustic space is less clear. Previously
we presented fMRI evidence for auditory spatial tuning in human
planum temporale, when neither attention to space nor to sounds was
required. Are these spatially tuned neurons also tonotopically tuned?
Fifteen subjects were tested in a sparse fMRI experiment, using individually tailored sounds to create a virtual acoustic space. We presented combinations of two sounds differing in pitch, from one or two locations in
the right hemispace, creating three types of blocks: Single Location, in
which both sounds were presented from one location, Fixed Mapping, in
which each sound was consistently mapped to one of the locations, and
Mixed Mapping, in which each of the two sounds was equally likely to
be presented from either location. We measured BOLD activation to test
repetition suppression (fMR adaptation) in the different conditions. We
surmised that only neurons tuned to both location and pitch should be
differentially adapted by the Mixed and Fixed mappings. Replicating
our previous findings, we found higher activation in the auditory cortex
for Fixed Mapping than for Single Location blocks, reflecting adaptation
to spatial location. Importantly, activation was higher for Mixed Mapping than for Fixed Mapping blocks, even though the two sounds and
the two locations appeared equally in both conditions. These results confirm that spatially tuned neurons in human auditory cortex are also
tuned to pitch, reflecting overlapping representation of different acoustic
features in auditory cortex.

TONALITY PERCEPTION OF BI-MUSICAL LISTENERS: AN MEG STUDY

Rie Matsunaga1, Koichi Yokosawa1, Daisuke Seki1, Saya Anbo1, Jun-ichi Abe1;
1Hokkaido University — Tonal organization is essential for music perception, and it is based on “scale schema” that is acquired through exposure
to the music of one’s culture. In some musical cultures (e.g., Japan,
Korea), listeners develop familiarity with two music traditions (e.g., Japanese traditional music and Western music in Japanese listeners) such
that they acquire two different scale schemas. These listeners are called
as “bi-musical”. This study examined whether bi-musicals have one general (or fused) scale schema or two distinct (or differentiate) scale schemas. We measured magnetoencephalogram (MEG) of Japanese bi-

33

Poster Session A — Saturday, April 2, 5:30 – 7:30 pm, Pacific Concourse
musical non-musicians while they monitored 480 unfamiliar melodies
for the presence of a pitch incongruent (i.e., a pitch deviating from the
scale). The unfamiliar melodies conformed to either Japanese traditional
scale (n = 240) or Western diatonic scale (n = 240). If bi-musicals have one
general scale schema, the MEG responses should not differ between two
musical traditions. Results showed that a peak latency evoked from a
pitch incongruent of Western music (around 260 ms) started 40 ms earlier than that for Japanese music (around 300 ms). Moreover, iso-field
maps at the peak latency revealed a similar dipolar pattern over each
hemisphere in two music traditions, but the pattern of Western was
clearer than that of Japanese. These differences indicated that Japanese
bi-musicals are more sensitive to a pitch incongruent of Western music
over that of Japanese music, suggesting that Western scale schema is predominantly internalized over Japanese one. It is likely that bi-musicals
handle two distinct scale schemas.

A5
RHYTHM OF PERCEPTION AND ATTENTION: AN OEP STUDY OF TEMPORAL
ATTENTION Molly Erickson1, Benjamin Motz1, William Hetrick1; 1Indiana
University, Bloomington — We investigate how listeners’ expectations for
sounds in a rhythmic sequence of sounds are affected by the metric
structure. In rhythm production tasks, there is a strong tendency for people to place “beats” at simple ratios, or harmonics, (1/2, 1/3, 2/3) of the
periodic pattern. The present study was conducted to examine whether
these constraints also apply to rhythm perception. In this experiment,
the generality of these rhythmic constraints was tested by asking
whether participants were able to anticipate the onset of auditory events
in rhythmic patterns that were defined by more complex ratios (e.g. 3/7).
Rhythmic anticipation was measured using the omission elicited potential (OEP, an endogenous brainwave component triggered by the
absence of an anticipated stimulus) as a marker for the moment when a
subject had anticipated an auditory event to occur. Results from this
experiment revealed that there were significant differences in the onset
latency of the OEP to omitted stimuli from these rhythms, indicating that
individuals are constrained to expect stimuli at simple ratios of the dominant cycle, even when entrained to sequences with more complex ratios.
Furthermore, it was observed that individuals with more variability in
OEP onset had poorer performance on tasks related to explicit temporal
estimation. These results suggest that the brain actively distorts the timing of complex external rhythms to simple metric patterns, and that less
distortion is related to more precise temporal representation.

MAKING A DIFFERENCE: AN EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL CORRELATE OF
ACTION-EFFECT BINDING János Horváth1; 1Institute for Psychology,
Hungarian Academy of Sciences — Recognizing the sensory consequences
of one’s own actions is one of the most important prerequisites of goaldirected behavior. The simplest cue that an action may have a sensory
consequence is the contiguity (temporal proximity) of the action and an
unpredictable change in the sensory environment. Using a novel protocol, the present study investigated the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of the establishment of action-effect representations. A sequence
of sinusoid tones of 1000 Hz frequency with random, 2-6 s onset-to-onset
intervals were presented. Participants performed a time interval distribution reproduction task: they pressed a key so that consecutive keypresses were separated by silent intervals of 2-6 s with uniform distribution. In one condition, when key-presses coincided with a sound position
(about 3% of the time), a rare (1500 Hz) tone was presented. In the other
condition, the frequent (1000 Hz) tone was presented for such coincidences, while the rare tone was presented in random sound positions
with the frequency of the coincidences. In comparison to frequent
sounds, rare sounds elicited the mismatch negativity, N2 and P3 components. Frequent sounds elicited suppressed N1 and P2 when coinciding
with a key-press in comparison to those without coincidence. Importantly, the effects resulting from sound infrequency and key-press-coincidence could not fully explain the ERPs elicited by the coincidence of
the key-press and the rare sound: these elicited an additional parietal
34

negativity at 140 ms following onset. This parietal ERP may reflect the
first step in establishing an action-effect binding.

MODERATE MUSICAL TRAINING IS ASSOCIATED WITH GENERAL
ENHANCEMENT IN COMPLEX SOUND ENCODING AND BETTER
INHIBITION OF IRRELEVANT AUDITORY CHANGE: AN ERP STUDY

Natalya Kaganovich1, Caryn Herring1, Jennifer Schumaker1, Megan
MacPherson1, Christine Weber-Fox1; 1Purdue University — Previous reports
show that musical training may be associated with better linguistic skills,
such as prosody processing, speech-in-noise perception, and second language proficiency. Because speech is necessarily carried by voice, we
asked whether musicians have an enhanced processing of the human
voice. We collected behavioral and ERP data from non-professional
musicians and individuals without musical training while they performed a version of the auditory distraction task. Participants identified
each sound as either short (300 ms) or long (500 ms). In some blocks,
musical sounds (a G4 note played by a cello and a French horn) were
presented on 80% of trials while voices (a male and a female saying a
neutral “a”) were presented on 20% of trials. In other blocks, the reverse
was true. A change from one type of sound to another was irrelevant for
the duration judgment task. A control condition was also used in which
the same vocal and musical sounds were spectrally rotated, which precluded participants from identifying them as belonging to either vocal or
musical categories but preserved sounds’ complexity. Behaviorally,
musicians showed a slightly higher overall accuracy. Their reaction time
tended to be less affected by the irrelevant change in sound category
compared to non-musicians. Electrophysiologically, musicians exhibited
an enhanced negativity to all types of sounds between approximately
100 and 700 ms post-stimulus onset. These results suggest that moderate
musical training may be associated with a general enhancement of complex sound encoding as well as better inhibition of irrelevant auditory
change.

GAMMA-BAND SYNCHRONIZATION IN THE TEMPORAL LOBE INDEXES
METRONOME TIMING AND ITS SUBDIVISION Takako Fujioka1, Laurel

Trainor2, Edward Large3, Bernhard Ross1; 1Rotman Research Institute,
Baycrest, University of Toronto, 2McMaster University, 3Florida Atlantic
University — Gamma-band (~40Hz) neural oscillations are considered to
reflect neural computation for object feature binding and memory processes. Our previous results indicate that timing of isochronous sound
and anticipating its metrical grouping are reflected in the endogenous
broad-band response not only in the auditory cortices but also in a wide
area of the temporal lobe including parahippocampal gyrus, and sensorimotor related areas such as precentral gyrus and basal-ganglia. Here
we examined time courses of changes in the amplitude of gamma-band
oscillations when subjects passively listened to the metronome sound
and found two prominent gamma responses: the first peaking at 50ms
following stimulus onset and the second peaking centered between these
responses as if marking subdivisions of the metronome interval. Furthermore, the occasional omission of a stimulus resulted in a significant
gamma increase at ~150ms after the omission. Using spatio-temporal
principal component analysis (PCA), sources of gamma-band activity
were identified: The first component reflected both types of gamma synchronization in the bilateral primary auditory cortices, bilateral caudate
nuclei, and the right thalamus, while the second component reflecting
only the subdivided interval involved the precentral gyrus, the superior
temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum in the right hemisphere, and in the
precentral gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the middle temporal
gyrus and the frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere. We propose that the
network of gamma-band oscillatory activity in the temporal lobe contributes to the automatic maintenance of internally represented rhythm
which in turn involves motor and memory systems in the brain.

DURING AN AUDITORY SIMON TASK Carolyn Pauker1, Edward Golob1;
1Tulane University — The

limits of selective attention can be probed by
examining the impact of task-irrelevant information on behavior. Dualprocess models propose that task-irrelevant information can impair performance by automatically activating response representations that compete with those in task-relevant controlled processing. The interplay
between automatic and controlled processes is affected by global stimulus probabilities, but the neural basis has not been well characterized.
Here, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while subjects
(n=15) listened to monaural amplitude modulated white noise. Subjects
pressed a button (left/right hand) according to modulation rate (25/75
Hz) and ignored stimulus location (left/right ear). Stimulus-response
locations either matched (compatible, C) or differed (incompatible, IC).
The global probability of C:IC varied, with blocks of low (25%), equal
(50%), or high (75%) proportions of C trials. Auditory ERPs were examined among trial types (C/IC) and global probabilities, and included
early components (N100/P200) and frontal slow-waves (200-800 ms).
The Simon effect (reaction time IC>C trials, p<.001) increased linearly
with greater probability of C trials (p<.001), while accuracy on IC trials
had corresponding decreases (p<.001). Across global probabilities, early
slow-wave amplitudes (200-400 ms) were larger for the probable trial
type (p<.001). Late slow-wave activity (600-800 ms) was prolonged on IC
vs. C trials (p<.05). Global probability inversely affected slow-wave
amplitude on IC trials (600-800 ms, p<.001), without affecting C trials or
early ERP components. Early neural processing reflected trial probability, while late processing was associated with adjustments on IC trials.
These findings may reflect the bias of global probability learning on
dual-process interactions.

to neurocognitive metrics as well as non-specific behavioral measures,
supporting a new and efficacious form of therapy for this disease. Establishing the neural activity underlying this improvement would help to
confirm the efficacy of TCT, highlight the clinically relevant regions
affected that contribute to cognitive deficit in schizophrenia, and illustrate the importance of these areas in normal cognitive functioning. To
this end, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study cortical
activity during both a phoneme identification and a working memory
task in 38 schizophrenic patients before and after three months of TCT or
a controlled activity and in 14 healthy controls. This study is part of a
randomized control trial investigating the behavioral efficacy of TCT.
Time frequency analysis using a spatially adaptive filter developed in
our lab provided high spatial and temporal resolution of auditory and
memory-encoding processing streams. Our results indicate changes in
the magnitude and spatial representation of low-frequency activity in
auditory regions, representing normalization of sensory processing measures in schizophrenic patients after cognitive training. Training also
affected high-gamma oscillations in frontal areas, especially inferior
frontal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, during the memory
encoding tasks. These changes implicate a normalization of cortical
activity in specific regions during auditory discrimination and verbal
working memory, two functions impaired in schizophrenia.

of the brain’s greatest perceptual challenges is to segregate mixtures of
sounds into distinct “streams”. Despite its behavioral importance, the
neural mechanisms of streaming remain unclear. While interest in this
field has grown, most previous neuroimaging studies could not unambiguously attribute effects to changes in perceptual state because of concomitant changes in stimulus properties, such as frequency disparity. In
order to show a clear neural correlate of streaming, analysis must
account for perceptual state in the absence of physical stimulus changes.
Conversely, in order to interpret these prior experiments, one must
account for effects due solely to the differential processing of stimulus
features without a corresponding change in percept. To this end we
recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity while subjects explicitly categorized a mixture of two tone sequences as perceptually segregated or grouped. Using a tightly controlled paradigm to measure the
effects of stimulus disparity and perception independently we report
two main sets of findings. First, we show that the effects of perceptual
state are asymmetric between the two sequences, providing neural evidence of perceptual capture during auditory grouping. Second, we
observe a faster EEG response to perceptually grouped tones relative to
segregated tones, indicating facilitation of object processing within a
grouped stream.

Speech perceptual and motor dysfunctions are well known features of
schizophrenia. We aimed to elucidate how the oscillatory dynamics of
the auditory-motor network differ between schizophrenic patients and
healthy individuals in phoneme verbal reproduction. 14 healthy controls
and 22 schizophrenic patients, matched along demographic measures,
performed a phoneme repetition task, while we recorded the corresponding neural activity using magnetoencephalography. Subjects
heard either two or four phoneme stimuli, waited for a visual go cue,
and then repeated the phonemes. Activity filtered into canonical frequency bands was localized to each subject's structural MRI using a spatially adaptive filter implemented in our in-house open-source software
package. NUTMEG. We found significant differences in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the speech motor network between patients and controls. Both theta/alpha and high gamma activity in auditory areas
during the encoding phase differed between patients and controls.
Patients also exhibited different high-gamma power time courses in
speech auditory and motor areas during the pre-production phase. To
determine the effect of phoneme cognitive load, contrasts between the
four and two phoneme trials were computed for all subjects, and compared between the controls and patients. The load-effect manifested differently in patients and controls in auditory and frontal areas, across the
frequency spectrum, indicating that schizophrenic patients utilize neural
resources differently from healthy subjects in response to increased task
difficulty. The rich spatio-temporal picture that emerges from this study
may help to quantify the dysfunction in large-scale neural circuit behavior in speech perception and production in schizophrenia.

tiunit recordings in the auditory cortex and midbrain of animals. In this
study, we aimed at finding traces of fast auditory novelty detection in
the human AEP during a passive intensity oddball paradigm. An oddball condition using click stimuli (standard stimulus = 50 dB SL; deviant
stimulus [14%] = 40 dB SL), a reversed oddball condition (standard stimulus = 40 dB SL; deviant stimulus [14%] = 50 dB SL) and a control condition (random presentation of 7 stimuli with different intensities ranging
from 10-70 dB SL, 14 % probability each) were applied. The EEG was
recorded from 7 scalp electrodes and the data was analyzed in the ranges
of the auditory brainstem response, the middle-latency response, and the
long-latency response. In the middle-latency range, deviants elicited a
significantly more negative response than standards of the same intensity at the descending slope of the Na component (21-27 ms after stimulus onset). This outcome suggests that the human auditory novelty
detection system comprises fast processes which are taking place at
latencies similar to those found in single- and multiunit recordings in
animals.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE ROLES OF FUNCTIONAL AND ANATOMICAL
STREAMS OF PROCESSING IN SPEECH PERCEPTION Sophie
Scott1,

Carolyn McGettigan1, Zarinah Agnew1; 1Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,
London — The aim of this poster presentation is to examine the utility of

‘streams’ of processing in human speech perception. A decade ago, intelligible speech was demonstrated to recruit areas along the rostral ‘what’
pathway in the left temporal lobe, which has been associated with the
processing of the vocalisations of conspecifics in non human primates
(Scott et al, 2000). In parallel, studies indicated that auditory fields posterior and medial to primary auditory cortex were associated both with
heard speech and the movement of the articulators (Wise et al, 2001;
Hickok et al, 2000), and this has been termed a ‘how’ stream of processing (Scott and Johnsrude, 2003). In this poster I will review the ways that
more recent studies have replicated and developed these findings, using
both published and unpublished studies. For example, I will show how
the anterior ‘what’ stream has been implicated in the processing of unattended speech (Scott et al, 2004, 2009), and the ‘how’ stream in speaking
aloud under conditions of altered auditory feedback (Takaso, Eisner et
al, 2010). I will address the kinds of hemispheric asymmetries seen in the
left and right ‘what’ streams, and how auditory speech processing interacts with the wider language system (Obleser et al, 2007, Eisner et al,
2010). Finally, I will address how the ‘what’ and ‘how’ streams interact
in the rehearsal of verbal information (Mcgettigan et al, in press).

THE CORTICAL BASIS FOR THE DICHOTIC PITCH DEFICIT IN
DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA Marita Partanen1, Kevin Fitzpatrick1, Dorothy

Edgell2, Bruce Bjornson1, Deborah Giaschi1; 1University of British Columbia,
University of Victoria — Children with developmental dyslexia have diffi-

2

culty learning to read. They may also show deficits in temporal processing, which is the perception and integration of rapidly presented stimuli.
Our research group has previously shown that children with dyslexia
have deficits in dichotic pitch perception, which is a measure of rapid
auditory temporal processing. In the current study, we examined the
dichotic pitch deficit using functional MRI in children with average
reading ability and children with dyslexia. We presented ascending and
descending pitch sequences that were embedded in background noise,
using a sparse sampling design. The task was to press a button to indicate whether the tones were ascending or descending in pitch. The conditions included low (1) and high (10) signal-to-background noise ratios
(SNR), noise only, and silence. The tones in the low SNR condition can
only be perceived by integrating information from both ears (dichotic),
while the tones in the high SNR condition can be perceived monaurally.
Results demonstrated significant activation in bilateral Heschl’s gyrus
and superior temporal gyrus for low and high SNR conditions. Children
with average reading ability showed activity in the right superior temporal gyrus during both the low and high SNR conditions, while children
with dyslexia activated this region only during the high SNR condition.

36

Additionally, cortical activation in the low SNR condition was correlated
with reading ability. These results suggest that the cortical regions utilized for dichotic pitch perception are affected in dyslexia, and these
regions may be involved in the reading process.

MUSIC AND MU RHYTHMS Matt Schalles1, Noah Bresler1, Jaime Pineda1;
1University of California, San Diego — Theories

of
action-observation
matching systems hypothesize that hearing sounds associated with specific motor components may become associated in a Hebbian-like fashion and elicit activity in sensorimotor cortex. Activities such as playing
music engage precisely coordinated muscle patterns that are tightly coupled in time to the sounds they produce, and EEG could provide the
temporal specificity necessary to study these functional associations.
Specifically, the mu rhythm (8-13 Hz) desynchronizes during sensorimotor activity as well as during periods of visual action observation. Hence,
we predicted that audio-motor associations that rely on sequential patterns could elicit mu desynchronization despite alterations to pitch information. Over the course of 5 days subjects learned to play a simple piano
melody by ear over synthesized backing instruments. After successful
completion of training, subjects listened to clips from that song and two
similarly constructed songs (transposed and scrambled) while their
brain waves were recorded. Initial results suggest a trend towards significant differences between hearing the learned song and an unlearned
song. Blind source separation analyses showed that mu and theta activity varied significantly by song in central/temporal and frontal mu clusters compared to a more occipital cluster. Significant effects of song
occurred in these anterior clusters 1.5-2 seconds after the onset of the second beat of the song clip perhaps reflective of time to discriminate
between songs. Finally, desynchrony in upper beta appeared while listening to the transposed version of the song, while rebound synchrony
occurred across all frequency bands around the 5th second of the learned
song.

ACTIVATION IN MOTOR SPEECH REGIONS TRACKS WITH
EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED BIAS Jonathan Venezia1, Kourosh Saberi1,
Gregory Hickok1; 1University of California, Irvine — Recent evidence suggests

that the speech motor system may play a significant role in speech perception. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to a
speech region of premotor cortex impaired syllable identification but not
color discrimination, while TMS stimulation of motor areas for different
articulators selectively facilitated identification of phonemes relying on
those articulators. However, in these experiments the speech stimuli
were embedded in noise and performance was not corrected for
response bias. It may be that higher-level decision networks are preferentially taxed under conditions of stimulus degradation. Thus, the
present functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment is designed
to systematically manipulate response bias in speech perception using
degraded speech input. Minimal consonant-vowel stimulus pairs were
presented between volume acquisitions for same-different discrimination. Speech stimuli were embedded in Gaussian noise at the psychophysically determined threshold level. We manipulated bias by
changing the ratio of same-to-different trials: 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1. Ratios
were blocked by run and subjects were cued to the upcoming ratio at the
beginning of each run. We predicted that activation in speech motor
regions would vary systematically with bias. Indeed, we found that the
pattern of response bias – as measured using the criterion measure, “c,”
from signal detection analysis – was predictive of activation patterns in
left frontal brain regions typically associated with speech production.
Examination of discriminability (d’) indicated that performance was constant across bias conditions. These results suggest a role for motor
speech regions in decision components of speech perception under
adverse listening conditions.

NEURAL RESPONSE TO AUDITORY INFORMATION IN EXPERT AND NONEXPERT ATHLETES Elizabeth A. Woods1, Sian L. Beilock2, Arturo E.

is
Hernandez1; 1University of Houston, 2University of Chicago — Evidence
emerging that expertise in a sport can modulate behavioral and neural
responses and that expert athletes process information related to their
own sport and other sports differently. However, despite the high relevance of auditory information in athletics, previous research in the area
has primarily focused on visual processing. The goal of the present study
was to examine the effect of athletic expertise on neural response to auditory information. Participants played basketball or tennis at the collegiate (Expert) or recreational (Non-Expert) level. During the functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, athletes passively listened to familiar and unfamiliar sport and non-sport environmental
sounds. Overall the task recruited large swatches of bilateral activation
in superior temporal gyrus (STG) extending into middle temporal gyrus
(MTG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula, and precentral and postcentral gyri. Between group analyses revealed significant differences in neural activation between Expert and Non-Expert athletes, suggesting an
effect of expertise in processing auditory information. Specifically,
Experts showed greater activation in motor regions such as the postcentral gyrus and insula when listening to familiar sport sounds, while NonExperts showed greater activation in sensory regions such as the STG,
MTG, and precuneus when listening to unfamiliar non-sport sounds.
This suggests that Expert athletes’ brains were more specialized to
attend to and use familiar, relevant sounds while tuning out unfamiliar,
irrelevant sounds. Non-expert athletes on the other hand more broadly
attended to all possible relevant sounds. Taken together, implications for
theories of athletic training, auditory processing, learning, and brain
plasticity abound.

BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING EFFORTFUL AUDITORY RETRIEVAL

Wagner1, Elizabeth A. Woods1, Sian Beilock2, Arturo E. Hernandez1; 1University
of Houston, 2University of Chicago — Previous functional magnetic reso-

nance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that expertise in a sport can
modulate neural response (Beilock et al, 2008). However, these studies
have only examined differences in the visual modality. The present
study investigated the impact of athletic expertise on the processing of
auditory information. Participants were members of collegiate basketball
and tennis teams (Experts) and college-aged recreational players (NonExperts). During the fMRI task, participants heard basketball and tennis
sounds as well as familiar and unfamiliar environmental sounds. Following each sound participants were asked to explicitly retrieve the
sound or the action associated with the sound. Significant differences
were found between the two groups of athletes, suggesting an expertise
effect. Experts showed greater activation than Non-Experts in superior
temporal regions when processing familiar environmental sounds, but
no regions of greater activation when processing unfamiliar environmental sounds. Non-Experts recruited bilateral hippocampus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right fusiform gyrus and left Brodmann Area 6 to a
greater extent than Experts when processing familiar sport sounds, and
intraparietal cortex and Broadmann Area 3 when processing unfamiliar
environmental sounds. Taken together these results suggest that Experts
are better at processing familiar sounds and better at tuning out unfamiliar sounds, while retrieval of familiar sport information is more effortful
for Non-Experts.

sound than to the same sound when it is rare (Ulanovsky et al. 2003,
2004). In humans, the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) event-related component is elicited by infrequent violations of acoustic regularities, and it
could represent a correlate of stimulus specific adaptation (Nelken &
Ulanovsky 2007). Recently, the regularity extraction mechanism of
MMN has been shown to index predictability of tone sequence continuation (Bendixen et al. 2009). We investigated whether contextually dependent predictability inferences modulate adaptation by repetition of the
same deviant sound. The Electroencephalogram (EEG) of 16 participants
was recorded using a passive oddball isochronous stimulation paradigm
with pseudorandomized sine-tones of 500 Hz (Standard) and 560 Hz
(Deviant). In a 100% predictive condition a Deviant was always immediately repeated. In a 75% predictive condition a Deviant was occasionally
followed by a Standard. In a 50% condition a Deviant was followed
either by a Deviant or by a Standard with equal probability. Global probabilities (80% Standard, 20% Deviant) were kept constant throughout
conditions. MMN was significantly attenuated to the repeated Deviant
in the 100% predictive condition, suggesting that the occurrence of a second Deviant was anticipated. Adaptation in the 75% predictive condition approached significance, while no adaptation effect was evidenced
in the 50% predictive condition. These findings suggest that the auditory
system exploits contingencies between infrequent sounds to (partly)
overrule expectations for a frequent sound.

OBLIGATORY AUDITORY RESPONSES IN CHILDREN: NO N1 BUT BIG N1
EFFECT? Philipp Ruhnau1, Björn Herrmann2, Burkhard Maess2, Erich

Schröger1; 1University of Leipzig, 2Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive
and Brain Sciences — It is well known that obligatory auditory responses
measured with EEG/MEG differ substantially between school-aged children and adults. Usually, when presenting sinusoidal tones at fast rates,
the P1(m) and N2(m) components of the event related potentials/fields
(ERPs/ERFs) are prominent in children, whereas the P1-N1-P2 complex
is found in adults. It has been suggested that the auditory N1 emerges in
children at around 12-13 years of age. In the present experiment, we
measured ERPs and ERFs to a 500 Hz tone in 9-10 year old children and
an adult control group. This tone was either frequently repeated or presented randomly amongst tones of different pitches. A distributed
source model (sLORETA) was used with MEG to localize the sources of
the P1m, N1m and N2m components. In adults, the tone in the repeated
condition elicited only a P1m that was localized to the primary auditory
cortex (PAC). In the random condition, however, an additional N1m
component was elicited that was localized to the PAC and the superior
temporal gyrus (STG). In children, tones in both conditions elicited a
P1m and N2m which were both localized to PAC. Furthermore, the EEG
analysis revealed an N1 component in children that was highly similar
to adults when the repeated condition was subtracted from the random
condition. The current results strongly suggest that, contrary to previous
assumptions, the auditory N1 is already mature at around 9-10 years of
age, but is often obscured by strong P1-N2 components.

HIPPOCAMPUS ACTIVATION CORRELATED WITH COMPLEXITY OF
RECENT AUDITORY STIMULATION Michael Tobia1, Vittorio Iacovella1, Uri

Hasson1,2; 1Center for Mind/Brain Sciences, Trento, Italy, 2University of Trento,
Italy — The uncertainty or complexity of an environment can be quanti-

fied via information theoretic measures including those reflecting the
relative frequency of tokens and their transition constraints (Shannon,
Markov entropy). Given the purported role of the hippocampus in representing environmental uncertainty, we examined if it represents the
complexity of the recent past in a non-stationary context where input
complexity shifts with time. In an fMRI study, participants listened to a
series of four unique, repeating tones presented at 3.3 Hz for ten minutes, while performing a simple incidental visual task. Our analysis used
a sliding window approach where for each time point in the study we
quantified both 1st order Markov entropy and Shannon entropy of the
tone sequence presented in the recent 5 seconds. In addition to these

entropy regressors, two regressors coded for points in the sequence
where a trend towards greater/lesser entropy reversed towards the
other direction. Using a region-of-interest analysis, for each participant
we quantified the percentage of hippocampal voxels that reliably correlated with the regressors (single voxel threshold set at p < .05). We then
evaluated whether these percentages departed from chance (5%) at the
group level. The hippocampus was sensitive to Shannon’s entropy bilaterally (18.75%/12.2%, left/right), and Markov transition entropy bilaterally (22.9%/15.5%, left/right), but not for reversals in either type of
entropy progression. Our findings indicate that the BOLD time course
for a significant volume of the hippocampus is correlated with features
of non-stationary entropy, and suggests it represents the complexity of
the recent past.

THE EFFECT OF MUSICAL TRAINING ON PERCEPTION AND
REPRESENTATION OF SPEECH McNeel Jantzen1, Dane Aamodt1, Zachary
Stratton1, Lauren Shands1, Heather DeVries1, Melissa Devries1, KJ Jantzen1;

1Western Washington University — Musicians

are more sensitive to acoustic
features such as onset timing and frequency (Levitin, 2006). Musical
training may enhance the processing of acoustic information for speech
sounds. Phillips (2006) proposed that there are three levels of speech representation, acoustic, phonetic, and phonological. Further, Zeftawi
(2005) found that the encoding of acoustic information occurs earlier
than the encoding of both the phonetic and phonological information of
the speech signal. We addressed the following questions to determine if
and how musical training enhanced the ability to perceive and represent
a single speech sound in the presence of multiple speech sounds: 1)Does
musical training improve performance on a dichotic listening test.
2)Does musical training affect the ability to attend to one auditory
stream in the presence of another. 3)How does the neural representation
of the speech signal compare to behavioral results for musicians and
non-musicians. 4)Do musicians show more bilateral and/or right hemispheric activity when perceiving speech sounds. Thirty subjects, fifteen
musicians and fifteen non-musicians, were presented with a voiced
unaspirated stop consonant in one ear and a voiceless unaspirated consonant in the other ear such that all combinations were presented.
Through five tasks, subjects identified a dominant speech sound, indicated location for a specified speech sound, and indicated speech sound
for a specified location. Behavioral results indicate that musical training
improved subjects’ ability to perceive specified speech sounds. Musical
training effects and organization of acoustic features were reflected in
the EEG as observed by location and amplitude of the ERP’s.

INVESTIGATION OF MELODIC CONTOUR PROCESSING IN THE BRAIN

& Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, 2Center for Cognitive
Neuroscience, Dartmouth College, 3Center for Mind and Brain, U.C. Davis —
Music perception generally involves processing the frequency relationships between successive pitches and extraction of the melodic contour.
Previous evidence has suggested that the ‘ups’ and ‘downs’ of melodic
contour are categorically and automatically processed, but knowledge of
the brain regions that discriminate different types of contours is limited.
Here, we examined melodic contour discrimination using multivariate
pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data. Twelve non-musicians were presented with various ascending and descending melodic sequences while
being scanned. Whole-brain MVPA was used to identify regions in
which the local pattern of activity accurately discriminated between contour categories. We identified three distinct cortical loci: right superior
temporal sulcus (rSTS), left inferior parietal lobule (lIPL), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These results complement previous findings
of melodic processing within the rSTS, and extend our understanding of
the way in which abstract auditory sequences are categorized by the
human brain.

PERCEPTION OF TONE CONTRASTS IN CHINESE CHILDREN WITH

Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, China — Background:
Previous

research has shown a relationship between speech perception and dyslexia in alphabetic writing. In these studies speech perception was measured using phonemes, a prominent processing of alphabetic languages.
Given the primary importance of lexical tone in Chinse language processing, we tested the neuro physiological correlates of categorical perception of Chinese lexical tone in chidren with phonological dyslexia.
Methods: Dyslexic children and age-matched controls were tested on
their categorical perception of tone contrasts by behavioral and ERP
technology. Results: Experiment 1 used identification task to examine
the categorical perception of lexical tones between age-matched children
and dyslexic children. The results demonstrated that dyslexic children
perceived tonal contrasts less categorically and accurately than agematched controls. Experiment 2 further investigated the neural correlates of the categorical perception of lexical tones at a pre-attentive stage
between dyslexic children and age-matched children. We tested the perception of either a across-category or a within-category speech stimulus
shift. MMN amplitudes in response to the across-category deviant were
significantly greater than those for the within-deviant by age-matched
children. But there was no discrepancy between the two kinds of deviant
stimuli by dyslexic. The results also showed that categorical perception
of tone contrasts by behavioral and ERP technology are able to predict
different level of reading and phonological abilities.

LEFT AND RIGHT AUDITORY CORTICES CONTRIBUTE DIFFERENTLY TO
PERCEPTION OF SLOW AND FAST BINAURAL BEATS Takahiro Miyazaki1,
Jessica Thompson2, Bernhard Ross1; 1Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest
Centre, Toronto, Canada, 2McGill University — Interaural time difference

(ITD) is an important cue for sound localization. Periodic changes in the
ITD occur when two pure tones with slightly different frequencies are
presented to both ears separately, which evokes the sensation of a beat.
To reveal the relationship between cortical activities and beat perception,
auditory evoked steady-state responses to binaural beats were recorded
with magnetoencephalograpy. The beat frequency of the binaural beat
stimulus was dynamically changed between 3 and 60 Hz. A two alternatives forced choice behavioral test showed that the strength of the beat
sensation consistently decreased as the beat frequency increased over
this frequency range. Neuromagnetic activity was localized in bilateral
auditory cortices and source activity was analyzed in the time-frequency
domain using short-time Fourier transform. The contour of the time-frequency representation of cortical activities followed the rhythm of the
stimulus beat with different time-locking in left and right hemispheres.
Three distinct peaks of brain activity were observed at beat frequencies
around 6, 15, and 40 Hz. The 6 Hz activity, corresponding to perception
of a moving sound, was stronger in the left hemisphere, whereas the 15
Hz activity, corresponding to a warbling sound, was stronger in the right
hemisphere. 40-Hz activity occurred bilaterally. The different lateralizations according to slow and faster beat rhythms is consistent with the
concept of left hemispheric specialization for the temporal structure of
sound and right hemispheric involvement in processing complex sounds
and may reflect the distinct change in the subjective experience of the
binaural beat at various frequencies.

methodology. English and Polish listeners experience the cluster /pt/ in
their languages, but only the Polish group experiences the cluster in the
context examined in the current experiment (i.e., word onset). Acoustic
features of phonemes change with context and, therefore, only the Polish
listeners are exposed to the acoustic features of the word onset /pt/ cluster. Two and three-syllable nonsense words beginning with /pt/, /p´t/,
/st/ and /s´t/ were presented within same and different word pairs. A
syllable identification task revealed that Polish listeners were able to distinguish /pt/ and /p´t/ nonsense words but English listeners were not,
suggesting that contextual features of phonemes are intrinsic to perceptual speech processing. ERP responses to the second word in the pair
revealed native-language speech perception to be reflected late in
latency within the late positive component and P400. The ERP response
to the first word in the pairs revealed the P1N1P2 complex to the 2 and 3syllable pt words to be highly similar for the English and Polish listeners.
In contrast, English and Polish groups showed different responses from
lateral-temporal sites (T-Complex) to the 2-syllable pt word forms
reflecting native-language speech perception and these differences
began early in cortical processing at 40 ms. Together, these findings suggest that both acoustic and linguistic distinctions are reflected at early
stages of cortical speech processing but from different brain sources.

ALPHA BRAIN WAVE ENTRAINMENT THROUGH ACOUSTIC BEATS Henk

Haarmann1, Tim George1, Alexei Smaliy1, Joseph Dien1; 1University of
Maryland College Park — Various types of brain wave entrainment (BWE)
have been used in attempts to induce increases in neural oscillatory
states associated with improved cognition. Most studies using auditory
BWE have addressed the impact of binaural and monaural beats, which
involve the presentation of two sustained tones of different pitch. We
conducted an experiment that used a different form of auditory BWE
involving acoustic beats that consisted of short same-pitch tones cycling
on and off at the to-be-induced frequency. The aim of our study was to
test whether brief exposure to acoustic beats at the center alpha frequency of 10 Hz would transiently increase EEG power in the alpha frequency range and not in other frequency ranges, such as, theta and beta.
Each of sixty healthy adult participants had their full scalp EEG recorded
while listening to pink noise for 10 minutes. Two groups of participants
also heard an overlay of acoustic beats, presented at 10 Hz (alpha condition) in one group and 22 Hz (beta condition) in the other group. A third
group only listened to the pink noise (no beats). Results indicate the
presence of a frequency-specific increase in alpha power in the alpha
condition as a function of scalp topography, relative to a baseline condition without BWE. These findings motivate the use of acoustic beats as a
BWE method for testing theories about the causal influence of alpha
power on cognition (e.g., semantic memory).

GLUTAMATE NEUROMETABOLITE CONCENTRATION PREDICTS AUDITORY
P50M LATENCY IN ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS Jason Long1, Bobby

NM, 3MIND Research Network (MRN), Albuquerque, NM — Abnormal
glutamate levels are characteristic of an alcohol use disorders (AUD)
group, where as normal controls have shown an otherwise healthy
human population. Glutamate (Glu) is a critical excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is distributed throughout neural tissue. Magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to assess glutamate metabolite
levels in bi-lateral anterior cingulate cortices. Magnetoencephalography
(MEG) assessed P50m latency was used as a measure of processing in
auditory cortex. MRS and MEG data were available on 4 healthy control
subjects (HC), 6 subjects with current alcohol dependence (AUD-C; no
alcohol on board at the time of neuroimaging), and 5 subjects with alcohol dependence and at least one year of remission (AUD-R). No significant relationships between Glu and P50m latency were evident in HC.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

However, significant negative correlations were evident between Glu
and left hemisphere P50m latency (r = -.96, p= .001) and right hemisphere P50m latency (r = -.88, p = .01) in AUD-C; and significant positive
correlations were evident between Glu and left hemisphere P50m
latency (r = .90, p= .02) and right hemisphere P50m latency (r = .87, p =
.03) in AUD-R. No relationships were evident between latency and any
other neurometabolite. Hence, the relationship between Glu level and
neural function is mediated by alcohol status.

HUMAN GAMMA BAND OSCILLATIONS AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN
SENSATION AND CONSCIOUS COGNITION Bernhard Ross1, Takahiro

Miyazaki1, Takako Fujioka1; 1Rotman Research Institute, Toronto, Canada —

Continuous sensory input results in a central representation of the elementary features of our environment. However, we perceive an object in
the world around us as an integrated entity. Neural oscillations at frequencies around 40Hz (gamma band) have been discussed as mechanism for binding of sensory information for conscious perception. Our
model is that reciprocal thalamocortical connections form oscillatory
loops, in which the stimulus entrains synchronous oscillations. Binding
is than established by interaction between specific and non-specific
thalamocortical circuits. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the human
magnetoencephalogram (MEG) while participants listened to 40-Hz
amplitude modulated sound in a series of experiments. The 40-Hz
rhythm of stimulation synchronized oscillations in thalamocortical networks. We introduced subtle changes in the auditoy stimulus, which
were short temporal gaps, brief clicks to the opposite ear, changes in
sound location, and informational contralateral masking, respectively.
Consistently such stimulus modifications resulted in a reset of entrained
40-Hz oscillations, which was characterized by a 200ms time interval
with delayed response phase and increasing amplitude. Based on the
temporal dynamics we separated two partial 40-Hz oscillations; the first
was entirely stimulus locked and likely indicates sensory representation
and the second showed systematic temporal phase and amplitude deviations and likely indicates the emergence of an early object representation, which than becomes accessible for conscious perception. We
interpret the gamma band reset as process of resolving an existing binding when a new stimulus had been detected and establishing dynamically a synchronous network representing the new stimulus
configuration.

MONAURAL AND BINAURAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPATIAL CUE TUNING
IN HUMAN AUDITORY CORTEX G Christopher Stecker1, Susan A

McLaughlin1; 1University of Washington — Functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies have consistently demonstrated blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to be stronger in auditory cortex (AC) contralateral to the stimulated ear, a preference that might
reflect tuning to auditory spatial cues such as interaural level differences
(ILD), or alternately might originate in contralaterally biased monaural
pathways. The current study compared AC BOLD responses to monaural and binaural sounds varying in intensity (55-85 dB SPL) and binaural
configuration across imaging blocks. "Sparse" fMRI (TR=12s) at 3 Tesla
measured responses to 4000-Hz narrowband, temporally modulated
sounds. Stimuli were delivered monaurally or binaurally with intensities
matching (diotic condition) or opposing (ILD condition) across the two
ears. ILD values ranged -30 to +30 dB. Rate of presentation was either 5/
s (“slow”) or 40/s (“fast”). The overall stimulus set allowed measurement of parametric response-intensity and response-ILD functions,
along with indices of contralateral preference (contralateral vs ipsilateral), binaural interaction (binaural vs monaural), and response adaptation (slow vs fast). Monaural and binaural responses were
contralaterally biased (more strongly so in left than right cerebral hemispheres). Binaural responses indicated significant binaural suppression,
with minimum responses to ipsilateral ILD of 10-20 dB; larger ILD values produced responses similar to monaural stimulation of the contralateral ear (i.e., no binaural suppression). Adaptation effects were similarly
39

greater for moderate (10-20 dB) ILD values than for 0 or 30 dB. The
results are consistent with separate contributions of monaural and binaural, as well as left and right hemispatial, processing channels within
AC. Supported by NSF IOB-0630338, NIH R03-DC009482-02S1.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF COGNITIVE AGING IN FACE MEMORY: AN ERP
STUDY ON THE OWN-AGE BIAS IN FOUR CONSECUTIVE AGE GROUPS

Nicole Wolff1, Stefan R. Schweinberger1, Holger Wiese1; 1DFG Research Unit
Person Perception, Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany — Young
adult participants are more accurate at remembering young as compared
to old faces, a phenomenon known as the own age bias. However,
whereas most former studies examined clearly separate age groups, the
present study investigated behavioural and ERP correlates of recognition memory for faces in four consecutive age categories (ranging from
19-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60-79 years), both with respect to stimulus and participant age. Young and younger middle-aged participants demonstrated
similarly enhanced recognition memory for young and younger middleaged as compared to older middle-aged and old faces. No memory bias
was observed in the older middle-aged and elderly participants. Both
N170 and the directly following occipito-temporal P2 exhibited. In addition, a decrease in the ERP old/new effect (400-700 ms) was detected,
with clearly more positive amplitudes for hits compared to correct rejections in the youngest participant group, followed by a reduced effect in
the younger middle-aged group, and no significant difference between
hits and correct rejections in the two older groups. These findings show
similarly enhanced recognition memory in young and younger middleaged participants for corresponding face age categories, and thus no
own-age bias exclusively directed towards ‘in-group’ faces. Whereas
group differences in N170 and P2 reflect effects of cognitive aging on the
perceptual processing of faces, the reduced ERP old/new effect with
increasing age suggests declining contributions of recollection during
memory retrieval.

3Academia Sinica, Taiwan — Unlike

healthy controls processing faces with
global configurational information, it has been debated whether people
with Williams syndrome (WS) process faces with deviant strategy based
on local facial features. More behavioral studies found different results
between WS group and healthy controls, pointing to distinct face processing strategies of two groups. This study was aimed at finding neurological correlates of face processing to features or configurations in
people with WS with 128-channel event-related potentials. The participants were required to make same-different judgments to target faces
which followed the same face model (same-different task). Further interests on component sensitivity to explicit instructions to feature-changed
or configuration-changed faces were employed (feature-task, configuretask). In the same-different task, while the people with WS reflected sensitivity to feature-changed faces in the N170 component, the healthy controls did not have this reflection. With respect to the P2 component
showed larger neural activities to configuration-changed faces than feature-changed ones on healthy controls, the people with WS failed to
show this pattern with instruction attending to features or second-order
configurations of faces. Behavioral results found that the people with WS
were significantly less accurate than the healthy controls in detecting the
configurational changes in the configure-task. These findings are consistent with the local preference in this clinical group found in previous
visual construction studies. Together, the evidence suggests deficient

central coherence in integrating parts into whole in face processing of
people with WS.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF GESTURE PROCESSING ACROSS
DEVELOPMENT Elizabeth Wakefield1, Karin H. James1; 1Indiana
University — The use of gesture in a learning paradigm has been shown to
benefit learning (e.g., Church & Goldin-Meadow, 1986; Ping & GoldinMeadow, 2008), and is more beneficial for children than adults (Hostetter, in press); however, the neural mechanisms underlying this facilitatory effect are unknown. The current study was conducted as a first step
in determining how learning with gesture affects the brain. Specifically,
we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to identify how
the brain processes gesture across development as a way to localize
regions of interest for further studies. Three groups of children (5-11
year-olds) and adults watched movies in which an actor spoke a sentence and (1) performed a congruent gesture, (2) performed an unrelated
movement, (3) performed no gesture, or (4) a gesture was produced
without speech. Sentences were either iconic (e.g., “Bugs ran up his
arm”) or metaphoric (e.g., “Chills ran up his spine) in content, such that
the same gesture could be used in both contexts, as well as in the gesture-alone movies. Results reveal a developmental change in gesture
processing, as well as a difference in how all age groups process gestures
produced in metaphoric versus iconic contexts. Although all groups
show activation in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and visual processing regions, only adults recruit the premotor cortex bilaterally, and the
fusiform gyrus. The differences in how gestures are processed across
development may underlie the differential facilitatory effects of gesture
use in learning paradigms for children and adults.

MATURATION OF AUDITORY EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS IN
ADOLESCENCE Yatin Mahajan1, Genevieve McArthur1; 1Macquarie
University — Adolescence is a time of great change in the brain in terms of
structure and function. It is possible to track the development of auditory function across adolescence using auditory event-related potentials
(ERPs). We measured passive auditory ERPs to pure tones and consonant-vowel (CV) syllables in 90 children and adolescents aged 10-18
years, as well as 10 adults. The results revealed that the latency of the P1
and N1 peaks decreased with age, the latency of the P2 peak increased
with age, and the latency of the N2 peak remained stable across age. The
amplitude of the P1, P2 and N2 peaks decreased with age, while the
amplitude of the N1 peak increased across age. These patterns in maturation, which were seen for both the tone and CV stimuli, occurred earlier for tones than the CVs. Interestingly, step-like changes were
observed for N1, P2 and N2 peaks between 13 to 16 year olds, which
could be due to pubertal changes influencing underlying neural processes of generators. These results provide much needed insight into the
development of auditory ERPs in typically developing adolescents, and
will form norms for identifying atypical auditory processing in clinical
populations.

Radboud University Nijmegen, 3Goethe University Frankfurt am Main — A

large body of evidence suggests that action execution and action perception share a common representational domain. Thus, observed actions
are mapped onto one’s own motor representations, which enables
observers to anticipate and predict actions they are watching. To date
only little is known on age-related changes in the representations of
actions and how motoric experiences might compensate for these
changes. The present study investigated how precisely older and
younger adults are able to predict the time course of actions for which
they have motor expertise or not. Videos of figure skating actions as well

as everyday movements were shown to novices and figure skating
experts from two age groups (young/old). The actions were transiently
occluded at critical time points and the continuation afterwards was
temporally manipulated. Participants were asked to judge the temporal
coherence of the observed action continuation. Older adults predicted
the time course of observed everyday actions less accurately compared
to younger adults, demonstrating that action representations become
more imprecise with advancing age. However, figure skating experts
showed better performance when they observed figure skating actions
compared to novices of the same age group suggesting that in domainspecific tasks expertise might indeed attenuate age-related declines in
action prediction. As a next step, fMRI will be used to disentangle the
underlying brain activation patterns within the age groups as a function
of expertise. We predict that both age and expertise will modulate activity in the action perception network, including inferior parietal lobule,
premotor cortex, and superior temporal sulcus.

SIMULATING COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE USING A
COMPUTATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF COVIS Erick J. Paul1, Sebastien
Hélie1, F. Gregory Ashby1; 1University of California, Santa Barbara — Ample

evidence suggests that human category learning is mediated by distinct
systems depending on the nature of the category structures. COVIS
(Ashby et al., 1998) proposes an explicit system that mediates learning in
rule-based tasks and a procedural system that learns information-integration categories incrementally through trial and error. COVIS posits a
critical role of dopamine (DA) in both systems and was developed with
careful consideration of known neurobiological constraints. Given these
two features, a computational implementation of COVIS was designed
to simulate the myriad deficits observed in Parkinson’s disease patients
in a variety of benchmark psychological tasks. In Parkinson’s disease,
dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc)
degenerate at an accelerated rate (Albin, Young, & Penney, 1988); the
death of DA cells causes reduced DA availability to the SNpc’s efferent
brain areas such as the striatum and the prefrontal cortex. This loss of
DA affects both the explicit and procedural systems of COVIS: DA in the
explicit system affects hypothesis selection while DA in the procedural
system serves as the reward prediction error signal necessary for learning in the striatum. Manipulating the DA parameters in COVIS allows
for the model to reproduce several behavioral results typical of PD
patients under different learning conditions, such as the differential deficits in rule-based and information-integration categorization, increased
perseveration in the WCST and modified WCST, and poor performance
relative to age-matched controls in those tasks (for reviews, see, e.g.,
Ashby et al., 2003; Price et al., 2009).

AGE-RELATED DEDIFFERENTIATION IN THE FACE NETWORK Joonkoo

Park1, Joshua Carp1, Gerard Bischof2, Chih-Mao Huang2, Kristen Kennedy2,
Jenny Rieck2, Karen Rodrigue2, Thad Polk1, Denise Park2; 1University of
Michigan, 2University of Texas at Dallas — Previous studies have found that
cortical responses to different stimuli become less distinctive as people
get older. This age-related dedifferentiation may reflect the broadening
of the tuning curves of category selective neurons (“broadening hypothesis”), or it may be due to decreased activation of the category selective
neurons (“reduction hypothesis”). In this study, we tested these two
hypotheses in the context of the face-selective neural network. Nearly
300 participants ranging in age from 20 to 90 viewed images of faces,
houses, and control stimuli in an fMRI session. The face-selective bilateral fusiform face area (FFA), occipital face area (OFA), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and amygdala activations were identified individually
by contrasting neural responses to faces to neural responses to houses,
and the magnitude of such neural activations was examined across the
lifespan. Activation in the left FFA and the bilateral amygdala decreased
significantly as a function of age, confirming previous findings of agerelated dedifferentiation. Consistent with the broadening hypothesis,
this dedifferentiation in the left FFA was driven by increased activation

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

to houses. In contrast, dedifferentiation in the amygdala was driven by
decreased activation to faces, consistent with the reduction hypothesis.
These results suggest that age-related dedifferentiation reflects different
mechanisms in different brain areas. More specifically, dedifferentiation
in FFA activity may be due to broadening of the tuning curves for faceselective neurons, while dedifferentiation in the amygdala reflects
reduced activation of face- or emotion-selective neurons.

the mature adult brain, there are voice-selective regions that are especially tuned to familiar voices. Yet, little is known about how the infant’s
brain treats such information. Here, we investigated, using electrophysiology and source analyses, how newborns process their mother’s voice
compared to that of a stranger. Results suggest that, shortly after birth,
newborns distinctly process their mother’s voice at an early, pre-attentional, level, and at a later, presumably cognitive level. Activation
sources revealed that exposure to the maternal voice elicited early language-relevant processing whereas the stranger’s voice elicited more
voice-specific responses. A central, probably motor response was also
observed at a later time, which may reflect an innate auditory-articulatory loop. The singularity of left-dominant brain activation pattern
together with its ensuing sustained, greater central activation in
response to the mother’s voice, may provide the first neurophysiologic
index of the preferential mother’s role in language acquisition.

at Dallas, Center for BrainHealth, 2Washington University, 3University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center — The present study explored the neural

underpinnings of response inhibition among adolescents with ADHD
who were medically managed. One well-documented characteristic of
ADHD is impaired control of inhibitory processing. Sixteen male adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and 16 male neurotypical controls (Mean
age = 13.3) completed three versions of a response inhibition task while
EEG data were recorded. The required depth of semantic processing was
varied across the three versions to explore the role of complexity in
semantic processing. The lowest level version required relatively simple
feature-based discrimination (i.e., responding to a picture of a single
repeated car [80% of stimuli] and not responding to a single repeated
dog [20% of stimuli]); the next level required more complex featurebased discrimination (i.e., responding to multiple types of cars but not
multiple types of dogs); and the highest level required more conceptualbased discrimination (i.e., responding to objects but not animals). Mean
reaction time and accuracy did not significantly differ across the two
groups. However, for the ADHD group, the difference in mean evoked
potential amplitudes for NoGo compared to Go responses at 300 ms (P3)
in frontal regions (Fz) decreased as each task increased in semantic complexity. The control group only showed a difference in mean evoked
potential amplitudes at 300 ms in frontal electrodes for the most semantically complex condition. The pattern of frontal-mediated inhibition
effects for the ADHD group compared to the control group suggests that

successful inhibition for adolescents with ADHD requires greater

PERCEPTUAL PROCESSING IMPAIRMENTS IN MCI PATIENTS ARE
RELATED TO PERCEPTUAL INTERFERENCE Rachel Newsome1, Audrey

Duarte2, Morgan D. Barense1; 1University of Toronto, 2Georgia Institute of
Technology — Recent evidence suggests that memory in mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) patients may be improved by reducing interference
from competing, but irrelevant, stimuli (Della Sala, et al., 2005). In the
present study, we sought to investigate whether these findings would
extend to a perceptual task in which the degree of interference could be
carefully controlled. MCI patients performed a visual discrimination
task (a same-different judgment) with varying levels of interference. In
the high interference condition, many perceptually similar, semantically
negligible objects (blob-like objects) were presented sequentially. In contrast, in the low interference condition, these perceptually similar objects
were interspersed with dissimilar semantically meaningful objects (e.g. a
shoe and a bagel). MCI patients [n = 8] were impaired on the high interference condition compared to healthy controls [n = 11; t(17) = 2.22, p =
0.04]. Critically, performance was intact in the low interference conditions [t(17) < 1]. We suggest that the critical factor in modulating perceptual processing deficits in MCI patients is the degree of interference from
competing similar stimuli.

1University of Milano-Bicocca, Department of Psychology — Neuroimaging

evidence suggests that a parieto-frontal cortical circuit with action observation-action execution mirror properties exists in the human brain,
enabling adult individuals to understand the intentions of others.
Recently, a desynchronization in the mu-frequency band of infants has
been found during action observation, which seems to be modulated by
the goal of the action. This has been taken as evidence that the human
motor system might be involved in making predictions about the end of
an observed action from early in life. Here, we aimed at directly testing
the latter possibility by using the surface electromyography (sEMG)
technique with infants. We recorded sEMG from healthy, full-term sixmonth-olds while watching two video-clips displaying an agent either
reaching a pacifier and bringing it into the mouth (pacifier action) or
reaching a piece of lego and placing it on the head (lego action). The
mouth-opening suprahyoid muscles were selected as recording site. We
found a reduction in the EMG activation for the bringing as compared to
the reaching phase of the lego action (whole group). Moreover, a greater
activation was observed for the bringing phase of the pacifier action as
compared to the bringing phase of the lego action (half the subjects).
Present findings show a specific modulation of infants’ muscular activation with the type of action goal and strongly argue for an involvement
of the human motor system in action understanding early in development.

Utrecht and EKZ/AMC Amsterdam — Background: Visual processing is
modulated by Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid- (GABA-)ergic inhibition
between neurons in the brain. Psychopharmacological studies revealed
that small changes in GABA levels affect specific visual processes in
adults. General anesthesia, applied to induce a reversible unconscious
state during surgery, produces larger changes in GABA levels. As is sug-

42

gested by post-hoc cognitive studies in children, GABA administration
through anesthesia could have longer-lasting effects on brain functioning than previously assumed. Aim: In the present study, we directly
investigated whether GABAergic modulation through general inhalation anesthesia has long-lasting effects on visual processing in children.
If present, these effects would be expected for contrast sensitivity, texture segregation, and contour integration, but not visual acuity. Methods: Visual processing was investigated at home in thirteen typically
developed children (age 5-12 years). In a texture segregation task, the
difference in Event-Related Potential (ERP) response to homogeneous
and checkered stimuli was investigated. In addition, behavioral performance on acuity, contrast sensitivity, and contour integration were measured. Results were compared between before and the day after
GABAergic modulation through general anesthesia. Children were anesthetized with sevoflurane for urologic procedures under general anesthesia (>30 min) with locoregional analgesia in day care treatment.
Results: No changes on either ERP measures or behavioral performance
were found after surgery. These results show that GABAergic modulation through anesthesia has no long-lasting effects on texture segregation, acuity, contrast sensitivity, and contour integration. This suggests
that children do not suffer from abnormal neural or behavioral visual
processing due to anesthesia at one day after surgery.

SEPARATION OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL HAPTIC PROCESSING IN THE
BRAIN Nick Davis1, Simon Tomlinson1, Helen Morgan1, Martyn Bracewell1;

1Bangor University — Lifting an object with efficient grasp requires knowledge of the surface texture of the object and of the distribution of its
mass. Without the former the object could slip through the fingers, and
without the latter the object could rotate in the grasp. Differences in processing global and local features of objects and scenes are well known in
the visual modality. However it is not known how well these differences
extend to other modalities. This work aimed to discover if the haptic system showed a separation of global and local processing. People lifted
with the right hand small wooden objects while lying in a 3T MRI scanner. They were asked to judge either the surface texture of the object
(rough, medium or smooth) or the position of the grasp point within the
object (centred or off-centre). The task activated a wide network of brain
areas. We were especially interested in areas whose activity differed
between the global and local judgement conditions. We found that local
judgements preferentially activated the left primary sensory cortex (S1),
the bilateral insula and right inferior parietal cortex. Conversely global
judgements activated S1 bilaterally, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
and bilateral cingulate cortex. We conclude that the processing of global
and local information is separated in the haptic system. Of particular
interest are the right S1 and the right parietal areas, which relate to the
two different conditions. Future work will use these areas as targets for
brain stimulation to dissociably affect global or local haptic judgements.

control group received minimal game experience. Functional magnetic

of training. We examined Time × Strategy and Time × Gender interactions to isolate strategy- and gender-dependent changes in activation.
We found that most regions involved in complex motor control processing before training showed reductions in activation after training, in the

that the HVT group showed larger activation decreases in these areas
than the FET and control groups, coupled with better performance
improvement in HVT compared to FET and control groups. Relative to
females, at pre-training males showed greater activation in the right dorsal striatum and anterior cingulate cortex, coupled with better performance. However, gender differences in brain activation and

“MOTOR PLANNING MODULATES AVAILABILITY OF VISUALLY
PRESENTED ITEMS IN WORKING MEMORY.” Marnie Ann Spiegel1,

Thomas Schack1, Matthias Weigelt2; 1CITEC Center of Excellence Cognitive
Interaction Technology, Bielefeld University, 2Sport Psychology / Movement
Science, Institute of Sport Science, Saarland University — The ability to flexibly adapt movements to changing environments is vital. Previous
research has shown that actions are measurable and planned in considerable detail prior to motor execution. Action planning seems not to be an
isolated operation but rather an active cognitive mechanism that interacts with other cognitive domains like e.g., language or memory. The
goal of the present study was to investigate whether simultaneous motor
and memory tasks draw on common cognitive resources, and to characterize the nature of this interaction. Participants were asked to perform a
grasp-to-place task which required in some trials an update of the current action plan, while actively maintaining letters of a visually presented 3x3 matrix in working memory (phonological loop). In a second
step, precision demands on the motor task were manipulated. The
results suggest that a correction of a motor plan is a resources-demanding process, interacting with a concurrent memory task. Motor re-planning led to reduced availability of items in verbal working memory
resulting in a worse memory task performance. Dual-task costs were
greater for the re-planning of a high complexity motor task compared to
a motor task of low complexity. Interestingly, although the speed of
action was not influenced by the motor update, placing movements
more often resulted in movement errors. These data are consistent with
prior findings and support the notion that changing movement plans
requires cognitive resources withdrawn from other cognitive domains,
e.g. working memory. This processing effort leads to both, modulated
memory and decreased motor performance.

ARE INCREASES IN 20 HZ CORTICOMUSCLUAR MEG-EMG COHERENCE
ASSOCIATED WITH PLACEBO RESPONSES TO A SHAM TREATMENT

FOLLOWING THE INDUCTION OF FATIGUE? Catherine

Tobiason1, Jane Adkins2, Matthew Sacchet1; 1Osher Research Center, Harvard
Medical School, 2Wellesley College — Background: The 20 Hz beta rhythm

is the dominant oscillator in the supraspinal motor system. As part of
this larger system, 20 Hz corticomuscular coherence is thought to provide a descending drive that synchronizes local muscles during isometric holding tasks. 20 Hz corticomuscular coherence (CMC) disappears
during movement and is enhanced during visuomotor tasks requiring
high-precision holds. In this study, we hypothesized there would be a
positive relationship between beta CMC and centrally-generated fatigue,
based on the fact that beta CMC is thought to originate in cortex. Methods: We examined the role of centrally-driven fatigue by inducing perceived muscular fatigue using a 10-min sustained low-force (~6% MVC)
hold task that required high precision and mental concentration. Before
and after the sustained task, we used MEG to compare beta rhythm
CMC between the motor cortex and the first dorsal interosseous muscle
associated with low force holds (~3% MVC). We extracted a signal from
motor cortex using MRI to anatomically to localize the anterior bank of
the central sulcus. Building on previous reports of placebo effects in clinical and experimental fatigue, we also evaluated whether a placebosham therapy applied after the fatigue condition affected the Beta CMC

in a small sub-group of subjects (n=3). Results: Nearly all participants
reported moderate perceived muscle fatigue (~4.5/10 on Numerical
Analog Scale) coinciding with the loss of the prominent 20 Hz beta
rhythm CMC spike. The results of a small sub-group (n=3) who received
a sham treatment are considered in light of this preliminary fatigue finding.

IMPAIRED VOLITIONAL ACTION INITIATION AS A CANDIDATE
ENDOPHENOTYPE FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER? Lisa

Kloft1, Benedikt Reuter1, Riesel Anja1, Kathmann Norbert1; 1Humboldt
Universität zu Berlin — Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) show repetitive behaviours which might result from impaired
response selection or response initiation. By using simple volitional saccade tasks we recently found impaired response initiation and intact
response selection in OCD patients. The present study had two aims: to
replicate this finding and to investigate whether dysfunctional saccade
initiation reflects a genetic disposition for OCD. Therefore, the same volitional saccade task was used in 27 unaffected first-degree relatives of
OCD patients, 27 task-naïve patients and 27 healthy controls. We found
that unaffected first-degree relatives and OCD patients were slowed in
conditions of volitional saccade initiation when compared to healthy
controls. Reaction times between patients and unaffected first-degree
relatives did not differ significantly. To conclude, we confirmed the
assumption of slowed volitional response initiation in OCD patients
which is in accordance with findings from manual tasks. These deficits
might relate to known dysfunctions of basal ganglia circuitries in OCD
patients. Results from unaffected first degree relatives suggest that dysfunctional initiation of volitional responses might be a candidate
endophenoytpe for OCD.

CHARACTERIZATION OF SENSORIMOTOR RHYTHM (SMR) ON HEALTHY
AND PREMATURE INFANTS WITH PVL Minerva Moguel-Gonzalez1, Ana

Milene Roca-Stappung1, Thalía Fernández H1, Thalía Harmony B1, Salvador
Ruiz-Correa2; 1Instituto de Neurobiología, UNAM Campus Juriquilla, México.,
2Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas CIMAT. Guanajuato, México — A

prevalent form of brain injury in preterm infants due to white matter
lesions is Periventricular Leucomalacia (PVL); it is accompanied by neuronal and axonal deficits affecting many cerebral structures. Infants with
PVL are vulnerable to develop motor and cognitive impairments
because of the many risk factors in which are involved. It has been
described that premature infants with PVL show significant impairment
in sensory, motor and/or cognitive areas. The main purpose of this work
was to characterize the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) on healthy and premature infants with PVL. The SMR is an electroencephalographic
rhythm localized over the central regions during wakefulness; is reactive
to generalized movement and also presents a contralateral reactivity to
one hemibody movement. The SMR has been related to motor and cognitive development. At this work we show that SMR is established in different frequencies depending on age and presence of PVL. Healthy
infants of 4 -month old show an SMR between 3.90Hz-7Hz, specifically
at 5.46Hz and 6.25Hz, healthy infants of 8-month old show an SMR at 7
Hz and 7.8Hz. The 8-month old premature infants with PVL show an
SMR at the same frequency of its homologue control group, 7Hz, but 4month old premature infants with PVL don’t show the necessary electroencephalographic characteristics to establish SMR or show them at a low
frequency, 3.9 y 4.6Hz; which can be an evidence of an immature brain
for their age. Our results contribute with important information to the
knowledge of infant brain development. SALUD-2009-01-112217 and

DOPAMINERGIC CORRELATES OF THE GAP EFFECT IN REFLEXIVE
SACCADES Jutta Billino1, Jürgen Hennig2, Karl Gegenfurtner1;

Psychology, Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen, 2Personality
Psychology and Individual Differences, Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen —

Saccades allow for moving the eyes rapidly to targets of interest and thus
represent a basic prerequisite for precise visual perception in changing
environments. Latency of saccades is influenced by target characteristics
as well as cognitive factors. The gap effect refers to a substantial reduction of saccadic latency by fixation stimulus offsets and has been attributed to a preparatory process consisting of a general alerting component
and an ocular orienting effect. We were interested in the gap effect in
healthy adults with supposed differences in dopaminergic activation.
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays a major role in regulation
of prefrontal dopamine levels. The COMT val158met polymorphism
modulates enzyme activity in that met alleles lead to less active dopamine degradation and accordingly to higher dopamine levels. We investigated the gap effect in reflexive saccades in 62 subjects and determined
the individual genotypes. Subjects had to make horizontal saccades to
targets presented either in an overlap or a gap condition. In the overlap
condition, the fixation stimulus remained present during target presentation, in the gap condition, the fixation stimulus disappeared 200ms
before target onset. Analysis of saccade latencies yielded a significant
main effect of gap condition (F(1, 59)=120.1, p<0.01) and a significant
interaction between the genotype and gap condition (F(2, 59)=3.8,
p=0.02). There was no main effect of genotype (F(2, 59)=0.6, p=0.57).
Met158 homozygotes showed a more pronounced gap effect than both
other genotype groups. We suppose that higher prefrontal dopaminergic
activation contributes to enhanced ability to prepare saccades.

THE HUMAN MOTOR SYSTEM IS SENSITIVE TO TEMPORAL FEEDBACK
DISTORTIONS OF ONE’S OWN ACTIONS Carmen Weiss1, Manos Tsakiris2,

Patrick Haggard3, Simone Schütz-Bosbach1; 1Max Planck Institute for Human
Cognitive and Brain Sciences, 2Royal Holloway University of London,
3
University College London — A large body of evidence has shown that the
experience of self-agency is influenced by the congruency of sensorimotor cues during action execution. For example, an action (effect) is more
likely to be self-attributed when there is temporal congruency between
its execution and the actual sensory feedback. Moreover, recent studies
showed a specific suppression in the human motor system for one’s own
actions, which suggests that a sense of self-agency is embedded on the
level of primary sensorimotor representations. The present study sought
to further specify the involvement of the human motor system in selfagency. More specifically, we investigated whether the human motor
system is sensitive to temporal discrepancies between executed and
observed movements and whether and how this relates to the explicit
detection of those discrepancies. Participants performed simple finger
movements that were displayed on a screen in front of them either in
real-time or with a temporal delay. Furthermore, they were required to
judge explicitly whether the observed movement temporally corresponded to their actual movement execution or not. Using transcranial
magnetic stimulation, we compared motor-evoked potentials after the
observation of real-time and delayed movements. The results revealed
an increase of corticomotor excitability with larger temporal discrepancies between movement execution and observation. This modulation of
corticomotor excitability varied in close correspondence to individual
differences in the explicit delay detection performance. We conclude that
sensorimotor cues can influence lower-level, sensorimotor and higherlevel, explicit representations of one’s own actions in similar ways.

Leipzig, Germany, 2Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts,

University Paris Descartes & CNRS, France — We offer the first neurophysiological demonstration that the audio-motor representation of actions
(also known as ‘auditory mirror mechanism’) can quickly develop ex
novo in the adult human brain, and we show that the motor system dissociates the goals of newly acquired actions from the movements to
achieve them. The results of two TMS experiments shed light on the
mechanism of early automatic recognition of action-related sounds. They
demonstrate that matching of sounds and actions in the mirror system is
largely dependent on audio-motor experience: it gets established rapidly
when self-produced actions are associated with their perceivable outcomes. In addition, the results show that the activity of the motor and
premotor cortices is modulated by the action’s goal, suggesting that a
high-order audio-motor representation of action sounds emerges
through experience. Current theories assume that the mirror mechanism
develops through stimulus-response associations and through imitation
of others’ actions. Our work challenges this view by suggesting that the
brain, in the first place, learns to understand others’ actions by associating self-produced ones with their perceivable consequences. The results
also corroborate theories claiming that, through the motor resonance
mechanism, actions are not purely coded in terms of motor output, but
rather in terms of action goals. We believe that this work represents an
important step in the growing scientific understanding of action recognition and action representation.

MERGING ACTS TO EPISODES: WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT,
CONSISTENCY OF THE ACTOR OR THE PRESENCE OF OVERARCHING
GOALS? Mari Hrkac'1,2, Moritz Wurm1, Yuka Morikawa1, Ricarda

Schubotz1,2; 1Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research, Cologne,
Germany, 2Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Münster, Germany —

The actions we perceive during everyday life can be conceived as
sequentially and hierarchically structured events. Even when observation is discontinuous, for instance when following the interlaced plot of a
movie, we are able to recognize well the coherence of single acts building
a common action directed towards an overarching goal. The present
functional imaging study was aimed at identifying the neural signatures
of processing coherent acts. In particular, we set out to disentangle two
coherence-building factors in actions that normally covary: the actor and
the presence of an overarching goal. Subjects watched short video clips
of single acts that were either steps of a common action with an overarching goal or not. Acts were performed by either one and the same or
by varying actors. This 2 x 2 design resulted in four experimental conditions that were presented in a randomized trial design. Conjunctions
were calculated for the effect of overarching goals and actor. Observing
acts with an overarching goal yielded activation in intraparietal sulcus
bilaterally and precuneus and the right superior frontal sulcus reflecting
internal monitoring of action and mental imagery of the previously seen
acts belonging to the same goal. Observing acts performed by several as
compared to a single actor increased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex possibly due to stronger demands in tracking the actors.
Results emphasize an overarching goal rather than consistency of the
actor to be crucial for understanding acts as belonging to a coherent episode.

THE EFFECTS OF EXPERTISE ON REVISING EVENT MEMORY - AN FMRISTUDY Anne-Marike von Anshelm-Schiffer1, Ricarda I. Schubotz1; 1MaxPlanck-Institute for Neurological Research — Establishing forward models
encompassing predictions on the likelihood of specific events has been
recognized as a pivotal capacity. Hence, revising these predictions in
response to change should be of equal importance to successfully adapt
to dynamic environments. The current fMRI study investigated the effect
of forward model solidity on re-learning predictions. Before entering the
scanner, subjects were presented movies showing daily routines such as
preparing food. Expectation solidity was manipulated by varying the

Saturday, April 2, 5:30 – 7:30 pm, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session A
number of times each movie was presented. In the fMRI session, some
actions took an unexpected but valid turn. We hypothesized that adaptation to the modified model should vary as a function of pre-experimental
presentations of the corresponding original model. As a result, a parietal-premotor network showed activation attenuation over iterations.
The interaction between original model solidity and repeated presentation of the modified model activated anterior cingulate cortex, mesial BA
10 and cuneus, showing these brain areas to be involved in integration of
new information into an established model. This was regardless the
model being either the solid original or a modified model that had
reached considerable solidity by having been presented multiple times
of what the original had been. This network of mesial frontal and occipital components was comparatively less activated when the relation
between original and modified model presentation was on a par, meaning it was less active during the process of evidence accumulation in volatile environments. Results show that there is a circumscribed network
activated when receiving expectation-modifying information on a wellknown event.

STIMULUS SPECIFIC LEARNING IN PERCEPTUAL CATEGORIZATION
Jessica Roeder1, Michael B. Casale2, F. Gregory Ashby1; 1University of
California, Santa Barbara, 2University of California, San Diego — Rule-based

(RB) categorization tasks are those where the optimal strategy is easy to
verbalize and the categories can be learned via a logical reasoning process. In contrast, information-integration (II) tasks require participants to
integrate perceptual information from different stimulus components at
a pre-decisional level. There is abundant evidence implicating the striatum in II categorization. One popular account of II category learning is
that stimuli become associated with a response goal via dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning at cortical-striatal synapses. This hypothesis
makes the strong prediction that knowledge gained during II learning
should be stimulus specific, and therefore should not transfer to novel
stimuli that obey the same rules for category membership. This is in
sharp contrast to RB tasks, where the ability of participants to generalize
their knowledge to novel stimuli is well known. Three experiments
tested these predictions. As expected, in all three experiments participants were unable to transfer knowledge gained during II learning to
novel stimuli. Instead, when novel stimuli were introduced participants
had to relearn category membership, even though the novel stimuli
obeyed the same rules for category membership that the training stimuli
did. In contrast, with RB categories, participants were just as accurate at
classifying novel stimuli as they were training stimuli.

SEPARATE SYSTEMS FOR INITIAL CATEGORY LEARNING, BUT A
G.
COMMON SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC CATEGORIZATION Jennifer

Waldschmidt1, Sebastien Hélie1, Jessica L. Roeder1, F. Gregory Ashby1;
University of California, Santa Barbara — There is now abundant evidence

1

that human categorization is mediated by a number of functionally and
neurally distinct category-learning systems that are each best suited for
learning about different types of category structures. For example, initial
rule-based (RB) category learning is susceptible to dual-task interference
but not to button-switch interference, whereas initial information-integration (II) category learning shows the opposite pattern (button-switch,
but not dual-task interference). This study investigated whether RB and
II categorization are also mediated by separate systems after automaticity develops. To address this question, 36 participants were each trained
for over 11,000 trials in one of two RB tasks (simple or complex) or in an
II task. Each participant completed four training sessions in an fMRI
scanner. Results showed that later in learning, there were no significant
behavioral differences between participants who learned RB versus II
categories. After 11,000 trials of practice, in all three conditions, switching the locations of the response keys caused a similar highly significant
interference, and a simultaneous dual-task that engaged executive functions caused no interference. The fMRI analysis yielded similar conclusions. After automaticity had developed, activation in similar motor

regions was correlated with accuracy, and in all conditions activation in
the striatum was not correlated with performance after automaticity had
developed. Whole brain analysis also revealed several similar peaks
after extensive training. Overall, the results are consistent with a theory
assuming separate processing pathways for initial RB and II category
learning, but a common pathway after automaticity develops.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF AUDITORY PERTURBATIONS OF SPEAKING
AND LISTENING Naomi Kort1, John F Houde1, Srikantan Nagarajan1;
1University of California, San Francisco — Understanding

the role of auditory processing during speech offers insight into the mechanisms of
speech production and perception. Functional neuroimaging allows for
study of the neural correlates of speech production and the effects of
speech production on auditory perception. The role of sensory feedback
in speech is complex and remains poorly understood. Alteration of auditory feedback causes systematic changes in speech production. Thus,
experimental manipulation of auditory feedback during speaking offers
a unique window to understand the neural substrates of speech motor
control. In this study we explored the dynamics of speech production
and auditory perception during single vowel utterances using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Data was collected using a 275-channel biomagnetometer and analyzed with synthetic aperture magnetometry
(SAM) virtual sensor analysis. Subjects produced single vowel utterances and heard their voice through headphones. During the phonation
the subjects will hear a 100 cent pitch perturbation lasting 400ms pseudorandomly alternating between a positive and negative pitch shift. In a
separate run, subjects passively listened to the recording of their voice.
MEG responses in temporal sensors averaged around the perturbation
onset show a greater response in the speaking condition than the listen
condition. Virtual sensor analysis shows a sequence of activations first in
right auditory cortex followed by bilateral superior parietal temporal/
parietal temporal area (spt/pt) and then in left pre-motor cortex, then
continues with a later component in bilateral spt/pt and finally in left
auditory cortex. The State Feedback Control model of speech motor control can explain this sequence of cortical responses.

T’AIN’T WHAT YOU SAY, IT’S THE WAY THAT YOU SAY IT – NEURAL
CORRELATES OF VOCAL IMPERSONATION IN NON-EXPERT
PARTICIPANTS Carolyn McGettigan1, Frank Eisner1,2, Zarinah K Agnew1,

Sophie K Scott1; 1University College London, 2Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics — The investigation of expert behaviors in fMRI is of
considerable interest to cognitive neuroscientists. However, for some
skilled motor behaviors, the physical constraints of the MRI scanner
often mean that the expertise can only be measured indirectly (e.g. visual
observation of dance; Calvo-Merino et al., 2005), or using restrictive simulations (e.g. simple keypads for pianists; Baumann et al., 2007). An
additional problem is how to select control groups and tasks for some of
these highly specialized outputs. In contrast, speech production can be
performed naturally in fMRI and is an expert skill for normal adults.
Professional voice artists are additionally skilled in this capacity and
work in a variety of settings that require expert manipulation of the
voice, for example performing impressions of famous individuals, or
providing voices for cartoon characters. As part of a larger study of vocal
expertise, we collected fMRI data from a group of non-expert participants while they performed vocal impersonations of familiar individuals
and accents of English. Changing the voice during impersonations gave
increased activation in left-lateralized areas for speech motor planning
and production, and in left temporal cortex. Comparing the two impersonation conditions showed increased activation of visual and somatosensory cortex when participants attempted to impersonate a specific
individual, as opposed to a generic accent. These results suggest that
impersonating a familiar individual’s speech involves stronger visual
imagery (Ishai et al., 2002) and monitoring of somatosensory feedback
from the articulators (Dhanjal et al., 2008) in the attempt to generate a
specific non-self target voice.

THE PERCEPTUAL DEMANDS OF DELAYED ACTION ARE REFLECTED BY
INCREASED MU SUPPRESSION DURING MOVEMENT Leanna

Cruikshank1, Anthony Singhal1, Mark Hueppelsheuser1, Jeremy Caplan1;
1University of Alberta — The mu rhythm (8-12 Hz activity) is the chief EEG

rhythm implicated in sensorimotor behavior. It is present over the motor
cortex during periods of stillness and decreases during movement.
Recently, it has been suggested that while mu desychronization reflects
motor processes, it may also be sensitive to additional requirements of a
task, implicating a greater functional significance than was once
assumed (Pineda, 2005). We tested the hypothesis that mu suppression is
a sensorimotor phenomenon and not just a motor phenomenon. We reasoned that levels of mu suppression should index the sensory-perceptual
demands of a task. We examined mu activity during visually guided and
delayed actions, which rely on different amounts of sensory-perceptual
based neural activity. Delayed actions recruit sensory-perceptual mechanisms in the ventral stream whereas visually guided actions do not
(Goodale & Humphrey, 1998). Using a goal-directed reaching paradigm,
participants were auditorily cued to reach towards target dots appearing
on a touchscreen while EEG activity was recorded. Mu activity was
present prior to movement and desynchronized during the movement,
replicating the classic behavioral dependence of mu (Niedermeyer &
Lopes da Silva, 2005). Confirming our hypothesis, mu activity was more
desynchronized during delayed reaching. Our results suggest that mu
desychronization is a mechanism of sensorimotor integration and not
just motor control. These results are also consistent with the theory of
mu as an analogue of the mirror neuron system (Altschuler et al., 1997),
which is a proposed mechanism for perception-action coupling.

SENSITIVITY OF REPETITION SUPPRESSION TO CHANGES IN
FUNCTIONAL NETWORK STRUCTURE Shivakumar Viswanathan1, Pierre-

Michel Bernier1, Nicholas Wymbs1, Scott T. Grafton1; 1University of California
Santa Barbara — Depending on task demands, the same neurons can be
flexibly recruited as processing nodes in different functional networks.
However, the extent to which the neural responses are invariant within
different networks remains poorly understood. In the current study, we
examined the network invariance of the stimulus-repetition induced
adaptation response or Repetition Suppression (RS). The Repetition Suppression response of the BOLD signal has been widely used to localize
function in tasks that typically satisfy the assumption that a stimulus and
its repetition engage the same functional network. Here we instead used
a Stimulus-Response choice task where (i) a behavioral response and its
subsequent repetition could each be the product of different response
selection networks; (ii) a stimulus feature and its subsequent repetition
could engage different input networks. The overlap in the different stimulus-processing networks was manipulated by varying subjects' tasksets. In one task-set, every stimulus had to be held in memory till the
next trial; while the other task-set had no such memory demand. We
found that the BOLD response in motor execution regions (M1) was
invariant to whether a repeated response was an outcome of the same or
different network as the previous response. In contrast, the task-set governed which regions adapted to the stimulus repetitions coming from
different input networks. Our results suggest that network differences
may have a limited influence on RS at the motor output level due to the
convergent input from association and executive region networks used
for response selection.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CREATIVITY PERFORMANCE AND FINE MOTOR
CONTROL: POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH DOPAMINERGIC ACTIVITY
Bradley Ferguson1, Kristi Stringer3, Ana Hartman1, David Beversdorf1, Paul
Foster2; 1University of Missouri-Columbia, 2Middle Tennessee State University,
3University of Alabama-Birmingham — The neurotransmitter dopamine is
involved in the regulation of motor movements. On a finger tapping test,
decreases in finger oscillations have been shown to be associated with

46

reductions in dopamine. Further, spreading activation in the brain, a
critical aspect of creative thought, also decreases as a result of increases
in dopamine. Thus, a relationship may exist between finger tapping,
spreading activation, and creativity. This investigation sought to examine the relationship between finger tapping scores and indices of creativity. We hypothesized that lower rates of finger tapping would be
associated with increases in scores on behavioral (Abbreviated Torrance
Test for Adults; ATTA) and self-reported attributes and behaviors (Scale
of Creative Attributes and Behaviors; SCAB) of creativity. A total of 36
participants completed a finger tapping test, ATTA, SCAB, and surveys
assessing current mood and handedness. High and low finger tapping
groups were created by taking a median split of finger tapping scores.
The groups did not differ on handedness or current mood, and so subsequent analyses did not include these variables. Scores on the SCAB and
ATTA did not differ significantly for high versus low finger tapping
groups. We then conducted exploratory, non-linear analyses on the data,
as previous research indicates that an inverted U-shaped relationship
exists between dopamine and creativity. The relationship between SCAB
score and finger tapping was found to follow an inverted U-shaped
function. These findings suggest that a relationship between some measures of creativity and dopaminergic functioning, as measured by rates
of finger tapping, may exist.

THE NOVELTY P3 AND THE P2A: ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES
OF ACQUIRING ACTION-EFFECT ASSOCIATIONS Jeffery Bednark1, John

Reynold1, Tom Stafford2, Pete Redgrave2, Elizabeth Franz1; 1University of
Otago, 2University of Sheffield — Performance of goal-directed behavior is
contingent on associations between actions and their effects. We aimed
to identify the electrophysiological correlates of acquiring these actioneffect associations. In two experiments we measured the amplitude of
the novelty P3 and the P2a event-related potentials (ERPs) during a
motor learning task where participants moved a mouse cursor on a computer monitor to elicit a particular sensory effect, but without being
instructed how. We hypothesized: (1) The novelty P3 will initially have a
large amplitude which will then decrease with acquisition of actioneffect associations, and (2) P2a will occur when the sensory effect is relevant to task performance. In Experiment 1, the ERPs from the motor
learning task were compared to those from two control tasks with
already-defined action-effect associations. Only the motor learning task
elicited a novelty P3 that reduced in amplitude as participants acquired
an action-effect association. A robust P2a also occurred when the sensory
effect provided feedback related to task performance. In Experiment 2,
the ERPs from the motor learning task were compared to those from a
control task in which the participants’ actions did not elicit the sensory
effect. Both the novelty P3 and P2a elicited in the motor learning task
were significantly larger than in the control task. These findings suggest
that the neural formation of an action-effect representation can be
indexed by the novelty P3. Moreover, the P2a indexes mechanisms for
detecting effects which are caused by a person’s own actions.

ALERTING IN ELITE ATHLETES: BEHAVIORAL AND EEG STUDY Olga

Sysoeva1,2, Irina Polikanova1, Alexander Tonevitsky1; 1Moscow State
University, Moscow, Russia, 2Washington University School of Medicine, St
Louis, MO — The study examines the attentional networks in the group of
elite athletes and controls. The Attention Network Test (ANT) (Fan et al.,
2002) was used to differentiate the executive control, orienting and alerting systems. Alerting scores is obtained by subtraction the reaction time
(RT) in the condition with central cue (precede the target by 500 ms)
from that in the no cue condition. Orienting score is the subtraction of RT
in the spatial cue condition from that in central cue condition. Executive
score is the subtraction of RT for congruent stimuli from that for incongruent ones. Thirty-six cross country skiers and biathletes (9 females,
Olympic team level) and 26 controls (5 females) participated in Exp. 1,
which employs only behavioural task. In the Exp. 2 the high-density 256channels EEG was measured during the performance of ANT both for

elite athletes (5 elite male skiers) and controls (10 aged-matched man).
Exp. 1 showed that the elite athletes had smaller alerting-attention scores
compared to control group and higher executive-attention scores. Exp. 2
confirmed the smaller alerting scores for elite athletes group and showed
that athletes also have prominent contingent negative variation (CNV)
after the response preceding no cue condition while controls have not.
The amplitude of CNV significantly correlates with alerting scores. The
CNV component represents the degree of preparation to the upcoming
target stimuli. Therefore, the elite athletes’ smaller scores in alerting
might be explained by their ability to mobilize the alerting system even
without the cue stimuli.

RELIABILITY OF FMRI/TMS MOTOR MAPS ACROSS AGE GROUPS

Horn2, Jeffrey Kleim1,2, Bruce Crosson1,2; 1Malcom Randall VA Medical Center,

University of Florida — The current study compared the reliability of corti-

cal motor maps generated using TMS and fMRI across younger and
older right-handed adults. Seven younger adults (ages 19-31) and seven
older adults (ages 64-76) underwent three cortical mapping sessions at
one week intervals. All participants were caffeine-free, reportedly
healthy and did not engage in regular skilled motor practice of the upper
extremity. In each session, TMS motor mapping of the first dorsal
interosseous (FDI) muscle immediately preceded block-design fMRI
mapping of FDI using a 3N pinch squeeze task. Center of gravity (CoG)
shift and volume of activity were the dependent measures for both
modalities. As compared to older adults, CoG was significantly more
stable in younger adults on both TMS (U = 2.88, p<.01) and fMRI (U =
3.75, p<.01) motor maps. In older adults, fMRI and TMS maps showed
low intrasession correspondence in terms of map volume (? = .11, ns). In
younger adults, TMS and fMRI map volume was significantly correlated
in sessions 2 (? = .76, p<.05) and 3 (? = .75, p<.05). These findings indicate
that motor map stability decreases with advancing age. Caution should
be used when interpreting motor maps, particularly with older adults.

AUDIOVISUAL SPEECH PERCEPTION IN NOISE IN CHILDREN WITH
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) Lars Ross1, Sophie Molholm1,2,

Daniella Blanco1,2, Natalie Russo1, Hans-Peter Frey1, Dave Saint-Amour3, John
Foxe1,2; 1Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 2City College and the Graduate
Center of the City University New York, 3University of Montreal — It has been
proposed that one of the root causes of autism is the failure to appropriately develop the ability to integrate multisensory inputs to benefit perception. However direct empirical support of such deficits is still scarce.
Impairment in communication is one of the hallmark symptoms in
autism and the ability to perceive speech is a fundamental prerequisite
for communication. In this study we assessed whether the integration of
auditory and visual speech signals is impaired in high functioning children with ASD by presenting them with monosyllabic words in auditory
alone, audiovisual and visual alone conditions under varying signal-tonoise ratios. We uncovered a severe deficit in the ability of the ASD children to benefit from visual inputs relative to age matched, typically
developing (TD) children, a deficit that became more severe as background noise levels increased. Eye fixations were similar in ASD and TD
children making it unlikely that the avoidance of fixating the face
accounts for this deficit. In contrast to profound differences in the ability
to benefit from multisensory speech cues, performance in the auditory

SUCHAN CROSSMODAL WORKING MEMORY PERFORMANCE IN

Irene Daum1; 1Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Ruhr-University Bochum,

Institute of Neurology and Neuroradiological Intervention, Essen — In
a
former study we investigated whether auditory and visual working
memory is organized in an amodal way, we investigated crossmodal
processing (visual and auditory) in working memory. We could demonstrate in this former study that the transformation of visual into auditory
modality activates the primary auditory cortex suggesting a re-coding of
visual stimuli when matched with their auditory probe. To study crossmodal processing in both directions, professional musicians reflect a perfect population as they are trained to read musical notes and to
transcribe auditory music into its written form. A special designed crossmodal two back task with rhythmical musical stimuli was used in this
study. 12 professional and 12 non-professional musicians were investigated using fMRI. Results of the three way interaction Group x Modality
x Transformation of the imaging data resulted in a right dorsolateral prefrontal activation related to auditory stimulus processing in professional
musicians suggesting a top-down control. Group x Modality interaction
yielded evidence for activation in the rolandic operculum related to activation of the Larynx which might reflect auditory perception – execution
matching. The interaction Transformation x Modality suggest a re-coding related activity reflected by activation in the visual and auditory cortex. Using rhythmically musical stimuli we could demonstrate recoding
processes of both modalities when matched to the different, probe
modality reflected by activation in the visual and auditory cortices.
Results suggest amodal processing in working memory. Additional
results give insight in specific and non-specific working memory processing in musicians and non-musicians.

EXPERIMENTAL INDUCTION OF A PERCEIVED “TELESCOPED” LIMB
USING A FULL-BODY ILLUSION Laura Schmalzl1, H. Henrik Ehrsson1;
1Department

of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden —

Phantom limbs refer to the sensation that an amputated or missing limb
is still attached to the body. Phantom limbs may be perceived as continuous with the stump, or as “telescoped” with the more distal portion of
the phantom being perceived as withdrawn within the stump. Telescoping tends to be related to increased levels of phantom pain, however the
causal relationship between the two remains unclear. In the current
study we induced the sensation of a telescoped limb in healthy individuals by using a full-body illusion. Participants saw the body of a mannequin, which was missing a hand, from a first person perspective while
being subjected to synchronized visuo-tactile stimulation through stroking. Differential stroking of the mannequin’s stump with respect to the
participants’ hand clearly influenced the perceived location of the hand:
a) Simultaneous stroking of the participants’ hand and the empty space
below the mannequin’s stump evoked the sensation of the hand being
located below the stump; b) Simultaneous stroking of the participants’
hand and the end of the mannequin’s stump evoked the sensation of the
hand being located “inside” the stump. In three experiments, we
obtained subjective data from questionnaires and objective measurements of differential proprioceptive drift in the two experimental conditions. The fact that telescoping sensations can be induced in healthy
individuals provides an intriguing platform for future studies investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms underpinning the phenomenon. In addition, it has the potential of shedding light on the relationship
between telescoping and phantom pain in amputees.

BEING BARBIE: THE SIZE OF ONE’S OWN BODY DETERMINES THE
PERCEIVED SIZE OF THE WORLD H.Henrik Ehrsson1, Arvid Guterstam1,
Björn van der Hoort1; 1Dept. Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden — A classical question in philosophy is if the sense of the body

influences how one visually perceives the world. By contrast, in vision
science, perception of object size and distance is traditionally explained
by the combination of information of different visual cues. Here, we
describe new illusions in which participants experience the ownership of

47

Poster Session A — Saturday, April 2, 5:30 – 7:30 pm, Pacific Concourse
a doll’s body (80cm or 30cm) and a giant’s body (400cm) and use these as
tools to demonstrate that experienced size of one’s body has a causal
effect on perception of object size and distance. When participants experienced the tiny body as their own, they perceived objects to be larger
and farther away, and when they experienced the large-body illusion,
they perceived objects to be smaller and nearer. These effects were quantified in ten separate experiments with complementary verbal, manual,
walking, and physiological measures. Our results are fundamentally
important because they show that there exists a causal link between the
size of one’s body and visual spatial perception. This shows that the representation of one’s own body size serves as a basic reference for scaling
allocentirc and ego-centric representations of external space. These
results resolve a centuries-old debate in philosophy and psychology and
demonstrate that the sense of one’s own body determines how we experience the world.

EVIDENCE OF TOP-DOWN PROCESSING IN RECALIBRATION OF TIME
PERCEPTION USING VIRTUAL DEPTH Kyung-Ae Cha1, Sung-Bin Hong2,

Sung-Ho Woo3, Hyun Taek Kim4; 1Korea University, 2Korea University, 3Korea
University, 4Korea University — It has been demonstrated that recalibrations
of audio-visual asynchrony are likely to occur in sensory processing
rather than in the higher domains of cognition in the brain. In the present
study, we investigated a feasible top-down modulation of time recalibration for judging auditory and visual input simultaneity using virtual
depths. A virtual corridor built for this experiment has depth of field,
and includes six light sources (light-emitting diodes: LEDs) affixed on a
computer monitor, which appear to be situated at different distances.
Subjects in the virtual environment (VE) were presented with both the
flashes of LED lights and associated bursts of white noise with random
stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Even though the auditory and visual
stimuli were presented from the same distance on the display device, the
subjects showed different time recalibration effects (TREs) depending on
subjects’ tendencies of immersion in VE. The results suggest that the differences in the TREs can be explained by subject-specific tendencies such
as absorption to stimuli, which can construct subjective reality in the
realm of top-down processing. Future research on neural substrates of
top-down processing in recalibration of time perception could contribute
toward understanding of how the brain creates the representation of
spatiotemporal coherence.

PROMPTING VIEWERS’ ADHESION TO FICTION IN LIVE THEATRE, AN
FMRI STUDY Marie-Noëlle Metz-Lutz1, Hélène Otzenberger1, Yannick

Bressan2; 1FRE 3289 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 2Université Paris Ouest
Nanterre La Défense — Unlike motion picture, which displays a fac-simile
of the real world on a fixed physically constrained space, i.e. the screen,
live theatre exhibits simultaneously two realities, one actual, related to
the performance itself, the other “fictional” conjured by it. Adhesion to
the fictional reality entails both a cultural posture, the agreement of the
viewers to provisionally suspend their judgement, and mental processes
enabling them to go beyond what perceptual inputs tell them about the
actual reality, i.e. to perceive the fiction as reality. This phenomenon
raises the issue of the cognitive processes shaping adhesion to fictional
reality during live theatre, and of their neural underpinnings. The physiological correlates of adhesion to fiction were investigated in an original
fMRI/ECG experiment recreating, within the laboratory, the unique
relationship between spectator and actor, peculiar to live theatre.
Instants when, for each spectator, fiction acted as reality were identified
using a first-person methodology, and used as a basis to work out individual fMRI time-series for statistical computations. Random-effect
group analysis allowed to define in response to 'theatrical events' a brain
activation pattern, within which changes related to subjects’ adhesion to
fiction, were investigated using a region of interest analysis. Besides a
robust decrease in dynamic heart rate variability resembling that associated with an altered conscious state, adhesion to fictional reality correlated with increased activity in the left BA47 and pSTS. The hypothesis

48

that aesthetic experience enables to dissociate physical and mental
(drama-viewing) experiences through subtle changes in state of awareness is discussed.

THE NEURAL TIMECOURSE OF AUDIOVISUAL INTERACTIONS AFFECTING
PERCEPTION OF DISTORTED SPEECH Ediz Sohoglu1,2, Jonathan Peelle1,

Robert Carlyon1, Matthew Davis1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
2University of Cambridge — Cortical integration across sensory modalities
is fundamental to successful identification of objects or words. For example, distorted speech sounds dramatically clearer if listeners are provided with prior information on speech content (e.g. a matching written
word; Frost et al., 1988). In the current study, we investigated the timecourse of these audiovisual interactions using magnetoencephalography
(MEG). Monosyllabic spoken words were spectrally degraded using a
noise-vocoding procedure (Shannon et al., 1995). Three levels of distortion were applied by varying the number of vocoder channels: 2 channels (high distortion), 4 channels (medium distortion) and 8 channels
(low distortion). A matching or mismatching written word was presented 1 second prior to each spoken word while an 8-point intelligibility rating procedure was used to measure perceived speech clarity. A
306-channel Elekta Neuromag MEG system was used to derive speech
evoked event-related fields from 15 right-handed participants. Our
behavioural results show that speech clarity is similarly enhanced by
increasing spectral detail and the presence of matching written input. To
assess neural correlates of these audiovisual interactions, a statistical
parametric mapping procedure was used to test for differences across
sensor space and time (Kiebel and Friston, 2004). The earliest effect of
matching/mismatching written words appeared ~300 milliseconds after
word-onset over right frontal sites followed by a more widespread left
posterior-temporal and bilateral frontal distribution 100 milliseconds
later. These effects become larger with increased speech clarity suggesting that neural effects of written feedback are contingent on there being
sufficient phonetic cues in the speech signal.

IMPLICIT CROSSMODAL ASSOCIATIONS MODULATE PERCEPTION:
AUDITORY AND TACTILE INFLUENCES ON VISUAL GRATING
PERCEPTION Marcia Grabowecky1, Emmanuel Guzman-Martinez1, Laura

Ortega1, Julia Mossbridge1, Satoru Suzuki1; 1Northwestern University — Our
recent investigations of crossmodal visual perception suggest pervasive
interactions, including sounds influencing perception of face gender
(Smith et al., Current Biology 2007), attention to body sensations affecting perception of self-faces (Smith et al., Current Biology 2008), and characteristic sounds of objects speeding target detection for both frequent
(Iordanescu et al., PB&R, 2007) and rare targets (Iordanescu et al., Acta
Psychologica, 2010). We have speculated that these crossmodal interactions stem from regular experiential associations. Some observed associations (e.g., gender and sounds) are implicit, whereas others may be
partially explicit (e.g., characteristic sounds in visual search). In the
experiments reported here, we demonstrated that visual gratings of specific spatial frequencies are reliably matched by specific sinusoidally
amplitude modulated sounds (sAM). The sAM matches were unaffected
by changes in viewing distance, suggesting that the matches were to
physical grating size rather than retinal spatial frequency. In a second
experiment, new observers matched the visual gratings with tactile
(vibration) frequencies that were very similar to the sAM matches. These
results suggest that tactile and auditory matches to visual spatial frequency might be mediated by the trimodal experience of tactile exploration of visual textures, with a resulting auditory experience. In the final
experiment, we investigated whether presentation of sounds matched to
a specific visual grating would influence dominance durations during
binocular rivalry. Consistent sAM sounds increased the proportion of
dominance for the matched grating, whereas inconsistent sAM sounds
were ineffective. These robust effects further support a role of experiential associations in crossmodal perception.

AUDIO-VISUAL FACILITATION OF THE MU WAVE Lucille

McGarry1,2,
2
1 1
Frank Russo , Jaime Pineda ; University of California, San Diego, 2Ryerson
University — Recent research supports the presence of audio-visual neurons in the mirror neuron system (MNS) that generate supra-additive
responding during perception of audio-visual (AV) versus unimodal
action. Measured using single-cell recordings in monkeys, as well as
fMRI studies in humans, AV facilitation occurs only when stimuli represent spatially and temporally congruent goal-directed action, suggesting
that mirror neurons not only respond selectively to sets of actions serving a single intention, but that they single out matching goal-directed
actions from multiple modalities (Kohler et al., 2002). In humans, AV
action facilitation has been demonstrated in the ventral premotor cortex
as well as the superior temporal sulcus (Kaplan & Iacoboni, 2007). EEG
recorded desynchronization of the mu wave, a frequency band with
peaks at 8-12 and 20 Hz, is thought to reflect activation in the MNS, but
AV facilitation of mu desynchronization has not yet been measured. In
the current study, subjects viewed audio, visual, or AV stimuli consisting of biological action or no action, while EEG was measured. An additional condition required subjects to participate in the action themselves.
EEG data was analyzed using independent components analysis. Preliminary analyses suggest that desynchronization of the mu wave is
greater in central, parietal and occipital areas during AV perception of
congruent action as opposed to unimodal perception. Conversely, the
mu wave is more synchronized during execution of action than during
perception conditions. These results suggest that AV facilitation does
occur in the MNS and can be captured through mu oscillations.

LET’S GO ROUND AGAIN: THE EFFECT OF VISUAL INTENTION ON NEURAL
1Ryerson
RESPONSES TO MULTI-STABLE PERCEPTS Ben
Dyson1;
University — Observing neural activity during the presentation of ambiguous sensory information is a useful tool in understanding how certain
internal processes such as perceptual intention are represented in the
brain independently of environment input. An experiment is described
in which two squares alternated with one another, in terms of simultaneously opposing vertical and horizontal locations relative to fixation
(i.e., stroboscopic alternating motion; von Schiller, 1933). Participants
were asked to impose two traditional forms of intended motion upon the
stimuli (vertical, horizontal) alongside three new forms of visual intention: clockwise rotation, counter-clockwise rotation, and, a free-view
condition in which participants were encouraged to make the percept as
unstable as possible. Subjective report of perceptual stability varied significantly across condition, with the rotational conditions showing intermediate levels of stability compared to relatively stable vertical and
horizontal motion, and, relatively unstable free-view motion. Visual ERP
showed significant group modulation in early evoked responses as a
function of intended motion. This was also reflected at an individual
level, with increased perceptual instability correlating with increased
negativity at parietal-occipital sites. Larger neural responses as a function of increased perceptual instability may reflect a ‘resetting’ of the
visual system, with instable motions less likely to lead to neural habituation. Evoked responses to ignored auditory stimuli were also collected
on half the trials but did not vary systematically as a function of visual
intention. The study underscores the utility of combining ERP recording
with the presentation of multi-stable percepts in revealing brain activity
associated with purely internal processes.

IS THE EEG MU RHYTHM SENSITIVE TO THE PREDICTED OUTCOMES OF
OBSERVED ACTIONS? Lorna C. Quandt1, Peter J. Marshall1, Thomas F.

Shipley1; 1Temple University — There is increasing interest in how the mu
rhythm in the electroencephalogram (EEG) relates to links between
action perception and production. The mu rhythm originates in the
somatosensory cortex and desynchronizes in response to observed and
executed movement. A recent suggestion from Csibra and colleagues is

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

that the mu response during action observation is predictive, such that
desynchronization begins as an action unfolds. We were interested in
linking this suggestion with the somatosensory origins of the mu
rhythm. Specifically, we examined whether mu amplitude during the
observation of reaching varies with differing proprioceptive outcomes of
otherwise identical reaching actions. Two pairs of objects were created,
with objects in each pair being the same size and shape but different
weights (80g vs 1200g) and colors (yellow/blue). Participants (N=31)
were initially given experience grasping and lifting the objects from one
pair. EEG was recorded while participants viewed videos showing a
right hand reaching for the yellow and blue objects. The kinematics of
the reaches were equated across conditions. Overall, desynchronization
during reaching observation was maximal at mid-central and mid-parietal sites for the lower mu band and at more posterior sites for the upper
mu and beta bands. Mu desynchronization was significantly larger in
the left hemisphere, contralateral to the observed action. However, mu
desynchronization did not differ for viewing reaching towards heavy or
light objects. The mu rhythm response during action observation may
represent a general gating of sensorimotor cortex rather than specifically
relating to the predicted consequences of the actions.

ROLE OF THE MOTOR SYSTEM IN AUDIO-VISUAL SPEECH INTEGRATION:
EVIDENCE FROM THE MCGURK EFFECT IN BROCA'S APHASIA William

Matchin1, Tracy Love2,3, Michelle Ferrill2,3, Gregory Hickok1; 1University of
California, Irvine, 2University of California, San Diego, 3San Diego State
University — A mismatch between auditory and visual speech information
can result in a fused percept that corresponds neither to the auditory nor
visual signal but rather to an intermediate form (McGurk effect). For
example, an auditory /pa/ overlaid onto a video of a speaker’s face
articulating /ka/ often leads to a percept of /ta/. Because visual speech
provides information about the articulation of a speech sound, many
speech scientists attribute McGurk effects to the involvement of the
motor system in speech perception, Broca's area in particular. An alternative is that audiovisual fusion is driven by cross-sensory integration in
the STS. We assess the role of the motor speech system in two experiments both designed to minimize motor input to AV integration. The
strength of the McGurk effect was assessed (i) during articulatory suppression in healthy adults and (ii) in patients with compromised motor
speech systems (Broca's aphasia). The McGurk effect was not reduced
during articulatory suppression in experiment one and a majority of
Broca's aphasics were found to exhibit a robust McGurk fusion effect;
subjects who did not show a fusion effect exhibited visual capture. This
finding argues for a minimal role of the motor speech system in audiovisual integration.

NEURAL ADAPTATION TO THE EFFECTS OF DELAYED AUDITORY
FEEDBACK ON SPEECH PRODUCTION Zarinah
Agnew1,
Carolyn

McGettigan1, Sophie Scott1; 1University College London — Speaking

under
delayed auditory feedback (DAF) results in dysfluent speech, which
manifests itself in a range of speech errors. The longer the delay, the
more severe the dysfluencies become, up to around 200ms. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that speaking under DAF conditions elicits activity in bilateral dorsolateral temporal cortices, and motor regions.
Individual vary in how severely they are affected by DAF, and over
time, performance of speech production under DAF conditions
improves. However, the neural basis of this adaptation and individual
variability is unclear. This is the first fMRI study to investigate length of
delay and individual variability in performance under DAF. This study
used functional MRI to investigate the neural networks underlying individual variability in ability to cope with, and adapt to speech production
under delayed auditory feedback. The results show bilateral posterior
auditory areas are more strongly activated under DAF conditions than
during normal speech production. A longer delay in auditory feedback
was associated with activity in right superior temporal and inferior pari-

SYNESTHETIC COLORS ARE PERCEIVED BEFORE CONSCIOUS
RECOGNITION OF GRAPHEMES Elizabeth Seckel1, V.S. Ramachandran1;
1University of California, San Diego — Two

projector grapheme-color synesthetes were shown two different examples of graphemes that are visible
only after prolonged viewing. The first stimuli was the famous “No Sex
Causes Bad Eyes” hidden message, which takes viewers approximately
30 seconds to see. The second stimuli was a Z composed of illusory contours and shadow which normals see as random shapes for approximately 30 seconds. Intriguingly in both cases the subjects saw the colors
accurately long before the letters and were surprised by this until the letters became visible. Subject 1 was also shown Bregmans B's which people see as fragments until an opaque black splotch is superposed to
allow amodal completion of B's. She did not see color (blue) in the fragments until the splotch was added. But when we retested her a year later
she had no recollection of the display, yet saw blue fragments - as if an
unconscious memory of the "completed" B's remained in her brain.
Results clearly demonstrate that graphemes can cross-activate colors
long before they reach consciousness ("blindsight"). This is consistent
with the cross-activation occurring in the fusiform gyrus between graphemes (or even PORTIONS of them!) and colors, before being relayed to
higher areas for consciousness. Lastly, if borders are drawn on the illusory Z, neon color spreading of the synesthetic color was reported, demonstrating that synesthetic colors behave like "real" non-synesthetic
sensory colors.

of California - Berkeley,

Satoru
Northwestern University — While perceiving speech, we experience mouth

2

shapes that are systematically associated with specific sounds. One
familiar association is between /woo/ and /wee/ sounds and visual
aspect ratio (vertical and horizontal elongation) of the mouth. A /woo/
sound is generated when the mouth is vertically stretched, whereas a /
wee/ sound is generated when the mouth is horizontally stretched.
Aspect ratio is a fundamental mid-level visual feature that is population
coded in the ventral visual pathway, contributing to perception of 3D
space, objects and faces. We demonstrate that hearing a /woo/ sound
increases the apparent elongation of a vertical (but not horizontal)
ellipse, whereas hearing a /wee/ sound increases the apparent elongation of a horizontal (but not vertical) ellipse. The shape selectivity of the
crossmodal effect as well as a control experiment ruled out response
bias. Furthermore, because we intermixed other environmental sounds
across trials, our observers were unaware of the auditory-visual associations that altered their visual shape perception. These results imply that
audiovisual experience of speech develops selective neural connections
from auditory spectral processing to visual shape coding, and demonstrates that the impact of these crossmodal associations is not limited to
metaphorical symbolism, but can actually change the appearance of a
basic geometric feature such as aspect ratio.

FINE SPATIAL GRAIN OF HUMAN ECHOLOCATION RIVALS PERIPHERAL
VISION Santani Teng1, Amrita Puri2, David Whitney1; 1University of

California, Berkeley, 2Hendrix College — Echolocating

organisms utilize
auditory information reflected from emitted vocalizations to represent
their external environment. This ability, long known in various nonhuman species, is also used by some blind humans as an aid to navigation and object perception. Using self-generated echoes, human practitioners of echolocation have demonstrated detection and localization of a
range of stimuli. Still, many fundamental characteristics of this skill in
humans are poorly understood, a dearth exacerbated in part by a lack of
standardized testing methods. The basic spatial acuity attainable by
practitioners — critical to object recognition and all spatial tasks —

50

remains unknown. Here we show that the spatial resolution achieved by
trained echolocators in an echoic vernier discrimination task is remarkably precise. We found that experts were able to discriminate horizontal
offsets of stimuli smaller than 1.5 deg. auditory angle, a resolution
approaching the maximum measured precision of human spatial hearing and comparable to that of bats performing similar tasks. We then
tested sighted volunteers on the same discrimination task and found that
visual performance equated to echolocation thresholds at approximately
35 deg. visual eccentricity. Our results represent the first measure of
functional spatial resolution in a group of expert echolocators and provide a potential benchmark for comparison to near-field sighted performance.

Steven A. Hillyard1, He C. Huang1, Diosalyn Alonzo1, Sergei Gepshtein2,
Howard Poizner1; 1University of California San Diego 2Salk Institute for
Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA — During rapid reaching to spatial targets,

subjects minimize error by taking into account the shapes of their endpoint error distributions (Gepshtein et al., 2007). To establish representations of pertinent error distributions (Trommershäuser et al., 2003),
multimodal sensory inputs must be integrated and adapted to current
task requirements. We investigated how eye and limb movements under
risk and uncertainty are coordinated, as well as how this coordination is
reflected in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Our focus was on
spatio-temporal EEG characteristics during movement planning, initiation, and execution of hand and eye movements. We recorded unconstrained 3-D kinematics of arm/hand/finger movements, eye
movements, and EEG scalp surface activity during visually-guided rapid
reaching. Healthy participants sat in front of a touch screen and performed time-constrained reaching movements with their dominant hand
from the screen center to a lateral stimulus configuration that consisted
of either a single reward region (day 1), or overlapping reward and penalty regions (day 2). Reward-penalty configurations were either aligned
or non-aligned with the movement direction. Hitting reward or penalty
regions yielded monetary gains or losses. Subjects were allowed to move
hand and eyes, or only their hand. We found that gaze points and reach
points were decoupled, the amount of decoupling modulated both by
stimulus position on the screen and by the relative position of reward
and penalty regions. Furthermore, restriction in eye-hand coordination
modulated distinctive EEG patterns that were associated with different
phases of task performance.

VISUAL INFLUENCES ON ECHO SUPPRESSION Christopher W. Bishop1,2,

Sam London1,2, Lee M. Miller1,2,3; 1University of California, Davis, 2Center for
Mind and Brain, 3Department of Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior —
Listeners can localize sounds better in reverberant environments by perceptually suppressing short latency (1-10 msec) echoes. This process is
known as the precedence effect and is putatively an early, unimodal phenomenon. However no study has addressed whether visual information,
which profoundly affects auditory perception in noisy environments,
also contributes to echo suppression. We conducted two within-subject
experiments to test directly for a visual contribution to echo suppression
and to characterize the temporal dependence of this interaction. In
Experiment 1 (N=15), we presented human subjects with temporally
leading (precedent) and lagging (echo) auditory noise-bursts spatially
separated by 36 degrees. Sounds were presented unimodally or combined with a coincident visual flash at the leading- or lagging-location.
Subjects pressed one of two buttons to indicate whether they heard a
sound at one- or two-locations (i.e. suppressed or failed to suppress the
echo, respectively). A repeated measure ANOVA revealed that, compared to the unimodal condition, echo suppression was enhanced by
14.15+/-3.28% (p=0.006) when a visual flash coincided with the leadinglocation and decreased by 9.88+/-5.08% (p<0.05) when the flash coin-

cided with the lagging-location. In other words, vision was able to
enhance or inhibit echo suppression. In Experiment 2 (N=18), we demonstrated that vision’s contribution to echo suppression persists with
audiovisual offsets (audio leading) up to 100 msec and is eliminated with
a 400 msec offset. Together, these data demonstrate that echo suppression is fundamentally a multisensory process in everyday reverberant
environments.

VISUAL-TACTILE INTEGRATION DEFICIT IN ANOREXIA NERVOSA Laura

Case1, Vilayanur Ramachandran1; 1University of California, San Diego — Individuals with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) experience pronounced body
image distortion. While much is known about the social and cultural factors that elevate risk for eating disorders, relatively little is known about
the biological basis of body image distortion in AN. Despite having normal visual perception, individuals with AN both feel and see themselves
as large-bodied. Recent work points to a possible right parietal dysfunction in AN underlying multimodal sensory body representation. In the
current study we tested tactile-visual integration in individuals with AN
and healthy control participants through a Size-Weight Illusion (SWI)
battery. The SWI task involves comparing the weights of two disks of
different sizes. Although the larger disk is heavier than the smaller one,
typical individuals experience a strong and robust illusion that the
smaller object feels much heavier because of an expectation that weight
scales with size. Individuals with AN exhibited a markedly reduced
SWI, suggesting disproportionate reliance on tactile and proprioceptive
information in judgments of size and weight. If proprioceptive input
from the patient's own body is distorted to begin with, helping patients
with AN to accurately integrate visual information with proprioceptive
input may help rehabilitate their judgments of size and weight regarding
their own bodies as well as external objects.

SOUND-SHAPE CONGRUENCY AFFECTS THE MULTISENSORY RESPONSE
ENHANCEMENT Elena Makovac1, Walter Gerbino2; 1University of

Edinburgh, 2Department of Psychology ‘‘Gaetano Kanizsa’’ and BRAIN Centre
for Neuroscience, University of Trieste, Italy — A sound-shape congruency
effect related to the takete/maluma phenomenon (Köhler, 1929) has
been demonstrated in a go/no-go task in which participants should
respond to visual targets while ignoring sounds (focused attention paradigm). In Exp. 1 auditory irrelevant stimuli (spiky vs. soft sounds) and
visual targets (spiky vs. curvy shapes) were presented to participants in
congruent vs. incongruent conditions. Four luminance contrasts differentiated low- vs. high-efficiency visual targets. The response enhancement was maximal for low-efficiency targets in the multisensory
congruent condition (according to the inverse effectiveness rule of multisensory integration). In Exp. 2 stimuli were presented at fixation. Contrary to data obtained in Exp. 1, the congruency effect was not obtained
in central vision, confirming that only relatively weak stimuli can fully
benefit from multisensory integration. In Exp. 3 participants responded
to both visual and auditory targets in congruent and incongruent conditions (redundant target paradigm). Using the Race Model Inequality test
(Miller, 1982) we inferred that the response enhancement in congruent
trials was consistent with multisensory integration, while the response
enhancement in incongruent trials could be explained by statistical facilitation only. In conclusion our results, obtained in an implicit association
task, support conclusions from explicit paradigms involving crossmodal correspondences (Gallace & Spence, 2006).

NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS OF SIGNAL MODALITY EFFECTS IN EXPLICIT
TIMING Elaine Wencil1, H. Branch Coslett1; 1University of Pennsylvania —
Psychophysical studies have consistently shown behavioral effects of
signal modality in timing operations. The functional and neural mechanisms that lead to these differences remain unknown. We address this
question by comparing regions activated during encoding, maintaining
and comparing intervals while performing auditory and visual timing.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Twelve participants performed a duration discrimination task during
fMRI scanning (see Wencil et al, 2010 for details). During visual trials,
participants monitor the duration of a green circle (VS1), presented for
300, 600, 900, 1200, or 1500ms. At VS1 offset a red circle appeared for
4000-6000 ms, permitting modeling of delay-period activity. A second
green circle (VS2) was then presented (300-1500 ms in duration). Participants indicated if VS2 was longer than VS1. Auditory trials followed the
same temporal structure as visual trials, with a 98Hz pure tone substituting the green visual stimuli (AS1/AS2) and 544Hz pure tone substituting
for the red circles. Posterior parietal cortex and IFG are similarly activated regardless of modality. However, when modeling the memory
component of temporal processing (that is, subtracting out visual or
auditory input), we find activation in modality specific cortices: auditory
cortices are strongly activated during memory of auditory stimuli
whereas visual cortices are activated during memory for visual stimuli.
These findings suggest that timing is achieved by means of a “simulation” of the input to be remembered in the cortex that processed the
input.

1University of Sussex, UK, 2University College London, UK — Seeing

touch
tends to result in activity in the somatosensory system, in addition to the
visual modality in which it is presented. However, there are many
details of this visual-to-tactile mapping that are not understood. For
instance, it is not clear how specific this is to human stimuli, objects or
human-like stimuli (dummies) and nor is it clear whether it reflects
somatosensory activity associated with the touching body part (e.g. the
finger) as well as the body part being touched (e.g. the face). In two
experiments using fMRI, with 16 participants, we explore these issues.
Observed touch to human faces, dummies and objects were all associated with activity in somatosensory regions (including SI) but tended to
be less somatotopically specific for dummies and objects. Merely observing a face or dummy (but not objects) without touch also engendered
some activity in this region. In the second study, we compared touch
delivered by a finger or paintbrush to the face or legs. Touch to the legs
from a finger (relative to paintbrush conditions) activated both the somatotopically organised hand and leg regions in SI suggesting somatosensory coding of both the agent and recipient of touch.

THE INFLUENCE OF CONTEXT IN RAPID VISUAL DISCRIMINATION W

John Monopoli1, Alyssa Compeau1, Jonathan W Page1; 1Dickinson College —
Requiring participants to rapidly identify objects leads to an increase in
visual discrimination errors. We wondered if contextual cues would
influence this. Using behavioral measures of accuracy and reaction
times, and the electrophysiological measure of error-related negativity
(ERN), we showed participants a rapid series of visual stimuli and had
them respond by pressing buttons on a keypad while recording brain
activity. In the first test, participants viewed a series of trials consisting
of a face, a visual noise mask, and an object in rapid succession. All faces
had neutral expressions and either included personal effects (like jewelry, tattoos, etc.) or not. Objects were pictures of either weapons (handguns) or non-weapons (cell phones or wallets) that participants had to
discriminate. The second test was the same as the first except an audio
sound of either a buzzer or a chime replaced the face/mask; participants
had to discriminate weapons and non-weapons. In the third test, negative or positive pictures from the IAPS set were shown subliminally followed by a mask and then a weapon/non-weapon for participants to
discriminate. The fourth and final test was a memory recognition test
using pictures of faces from the first test as “old” stimuli. We focused our
analyses on error processing (misses and false alarms). Differences in
cortical activity and behavioral responses were found in the three conditions and compared. Our results suggest that rapid discrimination leads
to visual errors in discriminating weapons and non-weapons, and that
the behavioral response has a neural correlate in the ERN.

Avishai Henik4; 1Department of Cognitive Sciences, Ben-Gurion University,
2Department of Computer Sciences, Ben-Gurion University, 3Department of
Learning Disabilities, University of Haifa, 4Department of Psychology, BenGurion University — We studied the mental representations of symbolic

and non-symbolic magnitudes, in a numerical Stroop task. Participants
were presented with two integers and had to indicate, in separate blocks,
the physically or numerically larger integer. The numerical and physical
ratios of the compared integers varied from 0.1 (most dissimilar; e.g., 1
vs. 9) to 0.8 (most similar; e.g., 7 vs. 8). The representation of symbolic
(numerical) magnitude followed Weber’s law, independently of the relevant dimension indicated by task demands. In contrast, the representation of non-symbolic (continuous) magnitude changed with task
demands. When the relevant magnitude was symbolic, the representation of (irrelevant) non-symbolic magnitude followed Weber’s /WeberFechner's law. When the relevant magnitude was non-symbolic, its representation deviated from Weber’s law—fitting a power function (i.e.,
Stevens' law). These findings raise some important suggestions: first,
symbolic representation is automatic and accurate, whereas non-symbolic representation is inaccurate and depends on task demands; second,
different representations can be co-activated in the same task; and third,
magnitude representations depend on modality and task demands, and
can be flexible. Altogether, our findings suggest that important constraints are in order regarding Moyer and Landauers’ (1967) claim that
numbers and physical magnitudes are compared in a similar manner.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF TACTILE MOTION AND PATTERN PROCESSING
IN THE HUMAN BRAIN Evelin Wacker1, Bernhard Spitzer1, Ralf

Lützkendorf2, Johannes Bernarding2, Felix Blankenburg1; 1Charite University
Medicine Berlin, 2Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg — Compared

with the extensive research on processing of motion and form in the
visual system, the specific neuronal pathways underlying perception of
complex tactile stimulus attributes remain poorly understood. Here, we
used ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
investigate the neural correlates of tactile motion and pattern processing
in the human brain. Different types of dynamic stimuli were delivered to
participants’ index finger via a Braille-like display, creating the sensation
of moving or stationary bar patterns during passive touch. In line with
previous findings, activity in early somatosensory cortex was increased
both during motion and pattern processing, compared to physically
matched control stimuli. Moreover, we found evidence for motion directionality encoding in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI
and SII), as well as for pattern orientation encoding in the intraparietal
sulcus (IPS). In higher-level cortical areas, tactile motion induced activity
in the middle temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) whereas tactile pattern processing engaged the supramarginal gyrus (SMG). These responses covaried with participants’ accuracy in identifying moving and patterned
stimuli, suggesting that hMT+/V5 and SMG may particularly contribute
to conscious perception of complex tactile stimulus attributes. An analysis of effective connectivity further revealed increased functional coupling between SI and hMT+/V5 during motion processing, as well as
between SI and SMG during pattern processing. This provides direct evidence for an integration of specialized higher-level cortical areas into tactile processing circuits.

REPRESENTATIONS IN HUMAN PARIETOFRONTAL CORTEX Sergey
Fogelson1, Lisa Sprute1, Casey Murray, Kate Johnson2, Elise Temple1, Richard
Granger1; 1Dartmouth College, 2Beloit College — Though particular frontal

and parietal brain regions have been implicated in numerical processing,

52

it has not been resolved whether individual numerical quantities (one vs.
two vs. three) are encoded independent of the form of their presentation
(e.g., pips on dice, Arabic numerals, written words). Using functional
magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 11 subjects as they viewed
sequences of infrequently presented stimuli (interstimulus interval 6sec).
Each stimulus presented a quantity (1-9) either as a dot array or as an
Arabic digit (with orders randomized and counterbalanced across runs
and subjects). After each sequence, a number was shown in word form,
and subjects indicated whether this test number had occurred during the
previous sequence. Using a multivariate searchlight, we were able to
decode the individual numerical quantities denoted by the stimuli. Voxels that were selective for particular numeric values within a given format (either dot or digit) were distributed across a parietofrontal network
that included superior and inferior parietal lobules, premotor, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Notably, we identified voxel clusters that, after
training on numeric values in one format (dots or digits), could recognize the same number in the other format. These occurred in bilateral
supramarginal gyri, left superior parietal lobule, and right anterior middle frontal gyrus. We forward the hypothesis that individual number
representations are represented in a format-specific manner in an overlapping parietofrontal network, whereas amodal numeric representations rely on a distinct subset of cortical regions.

IMAGING THE INTERRUPTIVE FUNCTION OF PAIN COMPARED TO
AVERSIVE NOISE – AN FMRI STUDY Katarina Forkmann1,2, Christoph

Ritter1,2, Michael Rose2, Ulrike Bingel1,2; 1Department of Neurology, UK
Hamburg-Eppendorf, 2Department of Systems Neuroscience, UK HamburgEppendorf — As the nociceptive system is essential for reactions to potentially life threatening situations, pain achieves salience in naturally complex environments and interferes with ongoing processes. This effect is
well characterized on the behavioral level, however, to date little is
known about its neuronal basis. Bingel et al., 2007 reported reduced neuronal activity in visual object processing areas while viewing irrelevant
images under pain resulting in reduced recognition rates of these
images. The aim of this study was to test for the specificity of this ‘interruptive’ effect of pain on visual processing. We therefore developed a
paradigm to compare the interruptive capacity of painful heat and aversive auditory stimuli in a model of visual object processing on the behavioral and neuronal level. In the first part of this experiment, participants
(n=25) had to categorize 60 images as living or nonliving objects. Twothirds of the images were randomly paired with individually adjusted
heat pain or loud noise stimuli. To further quantify the consequences of
this aversive stimulation, recognition rates were recorded in a subsequent surprise recognition task. Although noises were rated as more
unpleasant, painful stimuli had stronger effects on visual object processing (increased reaction times) and object recognition (diminished recognition rate) on the behavioral level. Preliminary fMRI analyses support
these behavioral findings by showing a modulation in object processing
areas in the ventral visual system. Our results indicate a pain specific
component in its interruptive capacity that is independent of the aversiveness of a stimulus per se.

NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF NONSYMBOLIC APPROXIMATE
ADDITION Kenneth Parreno1, Daniel Hyde1, Elizabeth Spelke1; 1Harvard
University — Humans and many non-human animals possess the ability to
represent the approximate numerical magnitude of a collection of items.
Furthermore, behavioral studies suggest that this system may be
engaged in arithmetic. We investigated the neurophysiological correlates
of arithmetic by measuring event-related potentials (ERP) as participants
(n =16) performed an approximate addition task. In this task, one set of
dots appeared and moved behind an occulder, then another set of dots
appeared and move behind an occulder, then the occluder disappeared
to reveal a third set of dots. Subjects were instructed to mentally add the
first and second set of dots and respond whether the third set of dots
was more or less than the sum of the first two sets. Critically, we manip-

Saturday, April 2, 5:30 – 7:30 pm, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session A
ulated the ratio between the third set of dots and the actual sum of the
first two sets of dots. We observed that both the behavioral and brain
response were modulated by ratio. More specifically, reaction time
increased as ratio decreased, accuracy decreased as ratio increased, and
the P2p component increased in amplitude as ratio increased. This pattern of brain response is consistent with previous observations of ratiodependent modulation of P2p based on number, suggesting that the
approximate number system was engaged. This response was not tied to
specific visual properties of the display because the sum was never
shown, only being created in the mind. Furthermore, this study links
previously indentified behavioral signatures of arithmetic with the neural signatures of approximate number in the brain.

ON THE SEGMENTATION OF OBSERVED ACTION: FMRI EVIDENCE Darja

Kraft1, Franziska Korb1, D. Yves von Cramon1, Ricarda I. Schubotz1,2; 11 Max
Planck Institute for Neurological Research, Cologne, 2Westfälische WilhelmsUniversität, Münster — People perceive activity around them in terms of
events. It is assumed that activity segmentation helps us to process the
perceptional stream by using event schemes. The present fMRI study
explored the neural correlates of detecting event boundaries in observed
action. Subjects watched movies showing all-day routine actions and
were asked to indicate event boundaries by immediate button press. As
we were interested in the segmentation of action on the basis of action
knowledge rather than on the basis of basic surface stimulus properties
such as change in speed or direction of movement, a baseline condition
was employed where subjects performed the same task on tai chi movements; this condition controlled for the perception of motion, human
body and person. The interaction of task (action, tai chi) by boundary
(yes, no) yielded activations in the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), the
left angular gyrus (AG), the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal cortex. On the basis of their specific functional profiles, the interplay
between these three areas can be considered to reflect the detection of
action segments on the basis of long term memory action knowledge.

DIFFERENTIAL THETA OSCILLATION FOR HUMAN WAYFINDING IN
VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS WITH GLOBAL VS. LOCAL OBJECT
LANDMARKS: AN EEG STUDY Wen-Jing Lin1, Teng-Yi Huang2, Chin-Teng

Lin2, Daisy L. Hung1, Erik C. Chang1; 1Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,
National Central University, Taiwan, 2Brain Research Center, National ChiaoTung University, Taiwan — Object landmarks play a key role in human wayfinding behavior. Previous studies from our lab showed that participants
had better wayfinding performance in virtual environments with local
than with global landmarks. The current study aimed to distinguish the
differential brain dynamics in processing these two types of landmarks.
Eleven healthy female adults were recruited to learn target positions in
virtual environments with either global or local object landmarks. After
their performance reached proficiency, scalp EEG data were recorded
when participants were searching targets in each landmark environment. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and to generate clusters
through computing scalp topography, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), dipoles, ERPs, and inter-trial coherence were done with the
EEGLAB toolbox. Based on previous findings, the ERSP of theta band in
the frontal midline cluster was subjected to a two-way repeated-measure
ANOVA, with condition (global/ local) and time (thirteen time windows
of one second duration) as the two factors. The results showed that theta
power was greater in global than in local condition immediately after the
appearance of the target icons and in the beginning first second when
one started to move. This suggests a higher demanding in computing
target position when using global landmarks. However, this pattern
reversed during the 2 to 4-second periods, and again reversed during the
last five seconds during the cruising stage. To conclude, the cognitive
loads varied across the entire wayfinding phase, depending on the type

of available landmarks and the stage of one’s progression toward the target location.

CONTEXT FRAMES PROVIDED BY DOMESTIC SETTINGS MODULATE
ACTION RECOGNITION: A FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE
IMAGING STUDY Moritz Wurm1, Ricarda Schubotz1,2; 1Max Planck Institute

for Neurological Research, Cologne, Germany, 2Westfälische WilhelmsUniversität Münster, Münster, Germany — Domestic rooms are specialized
places for specific actions. Hence, they provide contextual information
rendering some actions more likely to take place in a particular setting
than others. In analogy to the effects of spatial context on object recognition, we hypothesized that compatibility between contextual setting and
action modulates neural activity, particularly in the motor system, during action recognition. Subjects watched videos of context-specific everyday actions (e.g. cracking an egg) performed in rooms either compatible
or incompatible with the action. Actions were also performed in empty
rooms without any interior providing a neutral condition to distinguish
between the effects of compatible versus incompatible settings. We
found increased activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Brodmann
areas 44/45 and 47) when actions were incompatible to the setting –
either compared to the compatible or the neutral setting. The parahippocampal place area was activated when contrasting either of the room
settings with the neutral setting. Results indicate that context frames
activated by the setting modulate the perceptual analysis of actions. An
incompatible setting may trigger action representations that interfere
with the currently observed action. Alternatively, in order to make sense
of the action embedded in the incompatible context, the system searches
for more elaborate higher-level action representations compatible with
both the observed action and the context frame.

EMBODIMENT OF MOVEMENT SPEED IN A VISUAL TRACKING TASK AS
REFLECTED BY EEG MU RHYTHM DYNAMICS Jordan Prendez1, Jaime A.

Pineda1, Matt D. Schalles1, Rabina Joshi1, Robert F. McGivern2; 1University of
California, San Diego, 2San Diego State University — We tested the hypothe-

sis that mirroring provides a neural substrate for simulation and for the
embodiment of movement speed by recording EEG mu rhythms over
the sensorimotor cortex while participants engaged in a visual tracking
task. Embodied Cognition Theory (ECT) proposes that action provides a
framework for cognition. For humans, this might be a Mirror Neuron
System (MNS) based ability to predict the goals and intentions of others
through embodiment and to represent those actions in one’s own motor
circuits. It was expected that behavioral performance as well as modulation of mu rhythms, a presumed index of mirroring activity and embodied cognition, would vary as a function of stimulus speed. Secondly, it
was expected that men would show an advantage in task accuracy that is
consistent with previous research supporting the general male advantage in processing movement. Analysis of reaction times (RTs) in 32 participants (16 females, 16 males) showed that when tracking changed
from slow movement speeds (3cm/sec) to faster speeds (9cm/sec) RTs
decreased from 1.52s to 1.26s. Analysis of participant EEG showed more
mu suppression in the faster tracking speed relative to the slower tracking speed. While quicker reaction times and suppressed mu rhythm
were found in the fast speed condition as predicted, consistent with the
neural embodiment of speed, however, there were no differences
between the sexes in terms of mu suppression or task accuracy.

to understand events in terms of their causal structure. This allows us to
make sense of the world, and to predict and plan future actions. However, how we perceive causality remains unknown. Experiment 1 exam-

Poster Session A — Saturday, April 2, 5:30 – 7:30 pm, Pacific Concourse
ined how adults represent perceptual causality. Participants viewed
Michottean launching events in which the spatial and temporal parameters were systematically varied. Using ERP, we measured how participants differentiated these events. Participants were familiarized with
causal launching events. Oddballs differed in their temporal parameters:
both oddballs were equally different from the standard, but one was
within category (causal), and the other was categorically different (noncausal). There was a significant difference in P3 to events that crossed
category boundaries, but not to within category events (all ps < .01).
However, when familiarized with a noncausal event, there was no difference in participants’ electrophysiological responses to other noncausal
events. Adults categorized events by their underlying causal structure,
rather than their surface features. Experiment 2 investigated the effects
of context on the perception of launching events. Previous literature suggested that causal structure is a perceptual gestalt, extracted at the level
of the visual system. However, behavioral responses indicate that adults
differentially represent causal structure when the objects involved in the
event are agents versus inanimate objects. Future work will determine
whether this is a perceptual or conceptual distinction. These studies
present novel evidence about the representation of simple causal events.
Adults represent physical causation categorically, and differently from
social causation.

A VIRTUAL REALITY-BASED ASSESSMENT OF TOPOGRAPHICAL
DISORIENTATION IN PARKINSON´S PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT
DEMENTIA Francesca Morganti1, Sascha Marrakchi2, Jorn Timmermann2,

Peter P. Urban2, Giuseppe Riva3; 1University of Bergamo, Italy, 2Asklepios
Klinik Hamburg, Germany, 3Istituto Auxologico Italiano - Milano, Italy — The
ability to cope with orientation in everyday environment is highly relevant in order to manage the activities of daily living. Topographical disorientation is an often reported symptom in different forms of dementia
as well as in Parkinson's disease where patients often report difficulties
in wayfinding either in know as well as unknown places. According to
this perspective 49 subjects (23 female, 26 male; age 50-80 years) were
recruited at the department of Neurology at Asklepios hospital Barmbek
in Hamburg, Germany and assessed for spatial orientation in the VRRoad Map Test (Morganti et al. 2009). 32 patients had a diagnoses of Parkinson’s disease without dementia (PD) (MMSE: M= 28.94; sd =1.7); 17
patients had the diagnoses of Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD)
(MMSE: M= 25.59; sd=1,8). They were compared with a control group of
healthy subjects (n=68). Regarding the Parkinson patients we found significant differences in performing on the VR Road Map Test (PDpatients: M = 5,5; sd= 4,1; PDD-patients: M= 2,18 ; sd=1,8). Controls subjects performed better (M = 15,53 SD 11,35). Data analyses over the differences between the three groups revealed highly significant differences
in performance. PD-patients showed reduced ability to navigate in comparison to healthy controls of same age (p= 0.000), PDD-patients showed
reduced topographical orientation compared to PD-patients (p = 0.000).
These results appear to be congruent with recent studies according to
which not only cortical areas appear be relevant for topographical orientation.

FIRST-PERSON REPORTS OF TACTILE SENSATIONS IN EXPERIENCED
MEDITATORS PREDICT CORRESPONDING AREA OF PRIMARY SENSORY
CORTEX Kieran Fox1, Matt Dixon1, Pierre Zakarauskas1, Kalina Christoff1;

1University of British Columbia — Cognitive neuroscientists are increasingly
studying meditation, but little research has focused on the technique of
‘body-scanning,’ a major part of Mindfulness and Insight (vipassana)
meditation. As the technique involves focused awareness of bodily experience (in the absence of overt stimuli), it can be readily compared with
psychophysical and neurophysiological measures of tactile sensitivity
compiled from previous researchers’ reports. Three such measures were
correlated with novice and expert meditators’ first-person reports to
examine potential differences due to training. Methods: ‘Novice’ (n=4,

54

mean meditation experience=19 hrs) and ‘Expert’ (n=6, mean experience=3004 hrs) meditators engaged in a 20-30 min session of body-scanning. Experts were familiar with the technique; an experienced
instructor guided novices. Participants then completed a questionnaire
examining the intensity and clarity of sensations detected in 20 body
regions. Measures (culled from the literature) of tactile sensitivity (twopoint discrimination (TPD) and point-localization (PL) thresholds) and
neural representation (cortical area in primary somatosensory cortex, S1)
for each of 20 body regions were correlated with first-person reports.
Results: Experts’ first-person reports correlated strongly and significantly with all measures, whereas all correlations with novices’ reports
were nonsignificant. Further, the differences between group means on
all measures were highly significant. Individual correlations were predicted well, though nonsignificantly, by total hours of meditation experience. Conclusion: First-person meditation reports from experts, but not
novices, significantly predict average human TPD and PL thresholds,
and amount of cortex in S1 for 20 regions throughout the body. That total
meditation experience trends toward predicting this relationship suggests training effects.

Jason J. S. Barton3, Giuseppe Iaria1,2; 1University of Calgary, 2Hotchkiss Brain
Institute, 3University of British Columbia — In a recent study, we docu-

mented the first case of Developmental Topographical Disorientation
(DTD), a disorder characterized by (1) a life-long inability to orient in
both novel and familiar surroundings despite otherwise well-preserved
cognitive functions and (2) the absence of a cerebral injury/malformation or other neurological condition. In this follow-up study, we
described 120 new cases of DTD recruited via our website www.gettinglost.ca and assessed with an online battery evaluating a variety of cognitive skills. The aim of this study was to document the specific
navigation and orientation deficits that people with DTD display compared to matched (age, gender, and education) healthy controls. Our battery consisted of nine tests: three tests designed to assess deficits in
object recognition and face processing, and six tests designed to assess
performance on tasks engaging cognitive processes specific to orientation/navigation (e.g. heading orientation, landmark recognition). We
found that people with DTD differ from controls only in those skills confined to the orientation/navigation domain, among which the ability to
form a cognitive map was the most significant factor that distinguished a
person affected by DTD from control subjects. These findings are critical
in order to isolate the symptoms specific to DTD that may be useful for
clinical purposes, as well as to define a research protocol for further
examination of the brain mechanisms responsible for this life-long cognitive disorder.

University of Padua, Dept. of General Psychology. Padua - Italy, 2University of
Turin, Center for Cognitive Science. Turin - Italy — The aim of the present
study was to investigate the neural circuits underlying the observation
of socially motivated vs. individually intended actions. Seventeen adults
(7 males) aged 19-36 (mean 23.3 years) participated in an fMRI investigation. They were asked to observe video clips representing either socially
motivated (i.e. cooperative and competitive) or individually intended
actions. Stimuli consisted of video clips showing only the early stage of
an object-directed reach-to-grasp movement: in social-type of video clips
the final part of the movement, showing interaction with another agent,
was masked as to equate these with the individual-type of video clips. In
order to maintain a constant level of attention, following the presentation for each video, participants were asked to discriminate the congruency between a static image and a video clip. Results show that the
observation of socially motivated actions produces a significant activation within the left inferior parietal lobule, the left middle frontal gyrus

and the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally. These findings confirm and
extend previous literature demonstrating that the neural circuits
involved during the observation of explicit social interactions are also
alerted when the social nature of the observed action is only intended.

GLOBAL EFFECTS OF RTMS STIMULATION REVEALED BY
SIMULTANEOUS RTMS-ERP DURING A TEMPORAL DISCRIMINATION
TASK Martin Wiener1, Dasha Kliot2, Peter Turkeltaub2, Roy Hamilton2, David

Wolk2, H. Branch Coslett2; 1Department of Psychology, University of
Pennsylvania, 2Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania —

Recently, we (Wiener et al. 2010) demonstrated that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) of the right supramarginal gyrus
(SMG) selectively disrupted performance on a temporal discrimination
task, such that a brief train of stimulation during a visual stimulus
lengthened the perceived duration of that stimulus. While these results
demonstrate the involvement of the right SMG in temporal discrimination, they speak little to possible downstream effects of stimulation. To
further elucidate the neural mechanisms involved during stimulation,
we combined rTMS with event-related potentials (ERP). Subjects performed an individually-adapted temporal discrimination task, in which
they were required to judge whether a comparison visual stimulus was
longer or shorter than a standard stimulus (600ms). Brief trains of stimulation (10hz) were applied to either the right SMG or an occipital control
site, in separate sessions, 500ms prior to the onset of the standard stimulus. The behavioral data demonstrated a replication of our previous
result: subjects were more likely to report the standard stimulus as
longer when receiving rTMS to the right SMG. Following artifact-correction and standard ERP post-processing, the ERP data on rTMS trials
revealed a global difference in neural signals throughout the scalp during the encoding phase of the standard stimulus. This difference took the
form of a logarithmic positive-negative deflection from baseline (nonTMS) recording. Furthermore, the magnitude of this deflection was associated with the behavioral effect of rTMS. These results suggest that the
behavioral effect of rTMS stimulation on temporal discrimination is the
result of both local and distant neural structures.

THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF MOVEMENT DIRECTIONALITY
SCHEMAS Bianca Bromberger1, Fiona Shaw1, Anjan Chatterjee1, David

Wolk1; 1University of Pennsylvania — We sought to observe if the direction

in which one perceives an action to occur affects the processing and
memory of the event. Sixteen participants completed a memory task
while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Participants were
first presented with images of actions moving left-to-right, actions moving right-to-left, and static scenes. After a delay, they saw repeated
images (studied), as well as an equal number of new images (unstudied)
of the same types and asked to indicate whether they had seen the image
previously. We found a significant difference in reaction time between
responses to studied and unstudied left-to-right action images, but no
significant difference in reaction times between studied and unstudied
right-to-left action images. In addition, event-related potential (ERP)
analysis revealed significant differences in mean amplitude of studied
and unstudied left-to-right action images during several time epochs
after stimulus presentation onset, most notably in frontal regions. Similar frontal effects have been frequently attributed to controlled processing and post-retrieval monitoring in other ERP studies of memory. These
results are consistent with the hypothesis that actions with a left-to-right
trajectory conform to an underlying directional schema, likely influenced by language. The greater difference in frontal activity and
increased reaction times observed for unstudied relative to studied trials
in the left-to-right condition may be a result of conflicting information
for unstudied items. Left-to-right presentation may enhance the fluency
of these items, which may produce a ‘false’ feeling of familiarity that
needs to be overcome to correctly endorse the images as new.

PAIN ATTENUATION DURING MINDFULNESS MEDITATION IN A ZEN
MONK: AN MEG CASE-STUDY Kingson Man1, Koji Inui2, Ryusuke Kakigi2;

1University of Southern California, 2National Institute for Physiological
Sciences, Japan — Is it possible to "think away the pain?" We are inter-

ested in the effects of Zazen mindfulness meditation on painful experiences. We recruited a Zen Buddhist monk with over 15 years of
meditation experience as well as five naive control subjects to undergo
MEG scanning during the application of painful stimuli. Pain stimuli
were delivered to the dorsum of the palm using intra-epidermal needle
electrodes, which selectively stimulate the pain-sensing a-delta nerve
fibers. Neuromagnetic recordings were taken at the scalp during successive blocks of: rest with tactile stimuli; meditation with tactile stimuli;
rest with painful stimuli; and meditation with painful stimuli. During
meditation, all subjects reported a decrease in pain perception on the
visual analogue scale. Our results show strikingly different neural
responses to painful stimuli during the presence vs. the absence of meditation, for the naive subjects as well as for the Zen monk. Additionally,
there was an effect of experience: for naive subjects during meditation,
the short-latency components (100 ms) of the pain-related signal were
reduced over the somatosensory cortices. However, for the Zen monk,
signals over somatosensory cortex did not differ from rest to meditation;
only the longer-latency components (>300 ms) of the pain-related signals
were reduced, in a volume source-localized to the anterior cingulate cortex. These preliminary results suggest that meditation may effectively
attenuate the experience of pain, and that greater meditation expertise
leads to the recruitment of higher-level top-down mechanisms.

TACTILE SUPPRESSION OF DISPLACEMENT: EVIDENCE FROM EVENTRELATED POTENTIALS Mounia Ziat1, Philip Servos1, Vincent Hayward2,
Wafa Saoud1; 1Wilfrid Laurier University, 2UPMC Univ. Paris 06 — Similar

to
saccadic suppression of image displacement in vision, tactile suppression of displacement is a phenomenon where, in certain conditions of
direction and amplitude of displacement, people fail to detect that a tactile feature changes location between, for example, their index and middle fingers as they scan a tactile display. We used event-related
potentials (ERPs) to examine neural activity during trials in which subjects did not detect the displacement of a Braille dot (i.e., responded
‘same location’ when the dot changed location) and during trials in
which they did detect the displacement (i.e., responded ‘different location’ when the dot changed location) or trials in which subjects detected
no change in location (i.e., responded ‘same location’ when the dot
remained in the same location). We found that stimuli where the dot
remained in the same location evoked smaller N140 and P300 ERPs—
components known to be sensitive to stimulus-related attention and
stimulus categorization respectively—than stimuli that changed location. We also found that the amplitudes of N140 and P300 were larger in
trials in which stimuli changed location when they were perceived to be
in the same location than in trials in which stimuli changed location
when they were detected as such. These findings suggest that the inability to detect the change in displacement leads to increases in the amplitude of the N140 and P300 ERP components.

NEUROLOGICAL BASIS OF BRAIN-BASED BODY IMAGE SEX IN
TRANSEXUAL FTM INDIVIDUALS Rosalynn Landazuri1, Laura Case1,
Vilayanur Ramachandran1; 1University of California, San Diego — Transsex-

ual individuals perceive their body to be the “wrong” sex and often feel
strongly that their biological breasts or genitalia do not match their body
image. Despite years of research on transsexuality, most studies have
focused on subjective dissatisfaction with the body or response to sexual
stimuli. Several well-accepted neurological conditions also demonstrate
acute discrepancies between body image and the physical body. Amputees with phantom limbs feel a limb on their body that no longer exists,
while patients with Body Integrity Identity Disorders (BIID) consistently

Poster Session A — Saturday, April 2, 5:30 – 7:30 pm, Pacific Concourse
report that they should not have been born with a certain limb. It has
been proposed that BIID arises from a distorted supramodal body image
representation in the right superior parietal lobule (SPL). When sensory
input is inappropriate or disproportionate to SPL representation, body
image may be compromised and distorted. Recent data from our lab
demonstrate heightened skin conductance response and decreased SPL
activation to stimulation of the affected limb, supporting this hypothesis.
In the current study we compared skin conductance response to nonsexual tactile stimulation of the breast and leg in anatomically female, presurgical transsexual individuals and cissexual female individuals. We
found an overall diminished GSR response in transsexual individuals,
suggesting dissociation from the physical body, as well as a relatively
heightened response to stimulation of the breast. Similar to BIID, this
heightened sympathetic nervous system response suggests that sensation from the breast is not integrated normally in the SPL in transsexual
individuals, suggesting differences in brain-based body sex between
transsexual and cissexual individuals.

ILLUSORY COOLING OF THE SKIN ('THREE COINS ILLUSION')

University School of Medicine — If the middle toe is placed on a coin at
room temperature and the flanking toes (2 and 4) are placed on ice-cold
coins, the middle toe also feels equally cold; a striking example of perceptual filling-in of temperature perception. When the temperature of
the middle toe was measured, a significant decrease in skin temperature
for the cold-neutral-cold coin condition was found, suggesting top down
influences on skin temperature regulation modulated by the perceptual
input of the adjacent toes. We call this new psychosomatosensory effect
the "Cutaneous thermo-vascular response" (CTVR). CTVR may have relevance to clinical phenomena like Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD)
and Raynaud's phenomenon.

OCCIPITAL GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS MODULATED BY EYE MOVEMENTS:
SIMULTANEOUS EYE TRACKING AND ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY
RECORDING IN EPILEPTIC PATIENTS Eishi Asano1, Tetsuro Nagasawa1,

Naoyuki Matsuzaki1, Csaba Juhasz1, Sandeep Sood1; 1Children’s Hospital of
Michigan, Wayne State University — We determined the spatial-temporal
dynamics of gamma-oscillations modulated by eye movements, using
simultaneous eye tracking and intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG)
recording. Patients with focal epilepsy underwent subdural electrode
placement as a part of presurgical assessment for medically-uncontrolled seizures. They were asked to follow a target circle intermittently
moving from one place to another either in a saccadic or smooth fashion
during extraoperative ECoG recording. Movements of the target elicited
augmentation of gamma-oscillations in the polar-lateral occipital region;
subsequent voluntary eye movements elicited gamma-augmentation in
the medial occipital region. Neither type of occipital gamma-augmentation could be explained by contaminations of ocular or myogenic artifacts. The degree and extent of such gamma-augmentation were larger
around the onset of saccades compared to smooth pursuits. We also
found that eye blink elicited gamma-augmentation in the medial occipital region. In addition to the aforementioned eye movement task, two
patients were asked to read a single word. Gamma-augmentation was
elicited in the polar-lateral and medial occipital regions following stimulus presentation. Gamma-augmentation in the anterior-medial occipital
region was better time-locked to the onset of involuntary saccade occurring about 200-500 msec following stimulus presentation rather than the
onset of stimulus presentation. Gamma-augmentation in the polar-lateral occipital region can be explained by increased attention to a moving
target in the central visual field, whereas gamma-augmentation in the
anterior-medial occipital region may be elicited by the realigned images
in the peripheral field.

STAGES OF NON-SYMBOLIC NUMBER PROCESSING IN OCCIPITOPARIETAL CORTEX DISENTANGLED BY FMRI-ADAPTATION Chantal

Ghent, Belgium — The neurobiological mechanisms of non-symbolic num-

ber processing are not yet unraveled. Computational modeling proposed
three different stages for this processing: first, the spatial location of the
objects is stored in an object location map; second, this information is
transformed into a numerical summation code; and finally this summation code is transformed to a number-selective code. Here, we used fMRI
adaptation to identify the three stages and determine their anatomical
localization relative to one another. We adapted neurons by repeating

the same number of dots on the same locations on the screen, interspersed by deviants with different numbers of dots on same or different
locations. By creating orthogonal number and location factors in the
deviants, we were able to calculate three independent contrasts, each
sensitive to one of the stages. Non-numerical parameters were carefully
controlled. We found a gradient across occipito-parietal cortex for the
processing of non-symbolic number. The activation of the object location
map was found in the earliest stage in the inferior and middle occipital
gyrus, and then gradually decreased. The summation coding map exhibited a nonlinear pattern of activation along this stream, with first increasing and then decreasing activation, and most activity in the middle
occipital gyrus. Finally, the number-selective code became pronounced
further along the occipito-parietal processing stream, with an activation
peak in the superior parietal lobe and the supramarginal gyrus. Summarizing, we disentangled the three stages of non-symbolic number processing predicted by computational modeling, and demonstrated that
they constitute a pathway along the occipito-parietal processing stream.

VISUAL SEARCH FOR NUMEROSITY Weiwei Zhang1,2, Steve Luck1,2;

1Dept. of Psychology, UC Davis, 2Center for Mind & Brain, UC Davis — Ecologically important attributes in natural scenes not only arise from the surface features of isolated objects, but also from statistical representation of
groups of discrete objects. For example, objects are often grouped in
clusters, and it may be important to determine which clusters contain a
large number of objects and which clusters contain a small number (e.g.,
when assessing which trees in an orchard contain a large number of
apples or which checkout lines have fewer customers in a store). Much
research has asked how the overall number of objects in a scene is perceived, but little research has focused on how numerosity is perceived
within local regions. The present study aimed to test whether numerosity is a pre-attentive basic feature in early vision by looking at the relationship between attention and enumeration. We used a visual search
task in which search items were dot clusters that contained various numbers of dots. We found visual search for smaller numerosity (e.g., search
for a 10-dot target among 20-dot distractors) was inefficient with a 2:1
ratio for target-absent:target-present search slopes. In contrast, search for
larger numerosity (e.g., search for a 20-dot target among 10-dot distractors) was much more efficient. This is the same search asymmetry pattern observed for other simple features, such as contrast and size,
suggesting that the numerosity within a region is a basic feature in early
vision. Thus, perceptual extraction of numeric information from clusters
of dots can be as efficient as the perception of simple surface features.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF VISUAL AWARENESS ASSESSED VIA EEG IN AN
INATTENTION PARADIGM Michael Pitts1, Antigona Martinez1,2, Steven

Hillyard1; 1UCSD, 2NKI — Proposed neural correlates of visual awareness
include wide-spread recurrent activity and induced oscillations within
the gamma-band. To test these hypotheses, we employed an inattention
paradigm while recording the EEG. In the first phase of the experiment,
subjects performed a peripheral distracter task while task-irrelevant line

57

Poster Session B — Sunday, April 3, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse
segments presented centrally formed shape patterns or random configurations. During this phase, many subjects (N=19) failed to notice the patterns when queried and were thus considered inattentionally blind. In
the second phase that followed the query, the task was the same, but
now all subjects reported seeing the patterns. ERPs recorded over the
occipital pole were more negative for pattern-present compared to pattern-absent stimuli (at 180ms) regardless of whether subjects noticed the
patterns. At subsequent latencies (300ms), however, ERPs differed
between pattern-present and pattern-absent stimuli only when subjects
were aware of the patterns. In a third phase, the task was altered such
that the patterns were task-relevant. Here, the same ERP components
observed in phases 1 and 2 were evident, but were followed by additional more wide-spread activity that was absent in the first two phases.
Single-trial analyses of EEG spectral power revealed significant gamma
oscillations (35-45Hz, 300-400ms) only in phase 3, when the patterned
stimuli were task-relevant. These results challenge existing theories concerning the neural basis of visual awareness, suggesting that widespread activity and gamma oscillations may reflect task-related object
discrimination instead of visual awareness, which was indexed here by
an ERP negativity with a medial occipital distribution at 300ms.

PERCEPTUAL SERIAL DEPENDENCE: PERCEIVED ORIENTATION IS
ATTRACTED TO PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED ORIENTATIONS Jennifer

Shankey1, Jason Fischer1, David Whitney1; 1University of California, Berkeley —

The input to the visual system is noisy, but the physical world is generally continuous over time: objects tend not to appear and disappear suddenly, or change in identity spontaneously. The continuity of the
physical world could provide the basis of a heuristic for the visual system: if the world is continuous over time, perception should be continuous over time as well. By biasing the current percept toward what was
seen recently, smoothing visual perception in time, the brain could yield
more stable and accurate visual estimates in the face of noisy input.
Employing such a temporal good continuation heuristic would lead to
serial dependence in visual perception, where the perception of the current stimulus depends on what was presented before it. Here, we tested
for perceptual serial dependence using an orientation judgment task.
Subjects reported the orientations of sequentially presented gratings,
which were separated in time by several seconds. We found that on a
given trial, a subject’s perception of the grating orientation reflected not
only the currently viewed stimulus, but also a systematic attraction
toward the orientations of previously viewed stimuli. Perceptual serial
dependence hinged on spatial attention, occurring only for stimuli at
attended locations, and occurring most strongly when a series of
attended stimuli remained at a constant retinal location. Our results
reveal a systematic influence of recent visual experiences on perception
at a given moment: visual percepts are attracted toward what was previously seen at attended locations.

EYE MOVEMENT PATTERNS DURING THE PERCEPTION OF 3D OBJECT
SHAPE: PREFERENTIAL FIXATIONS FOR REGIONS WITH CONCAVE
SURFACE CURVATURE MINIMA Lina Conlan1, Filipe Cristino1, Candy
Patterson1, Steve Johnston2, Charles Leek1; 1School of Psychology, Bangor
University, UK, 2Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK — Although fixational eye

movement patterns have been widely studied in a variety of domains,
there have been no detailed analyses of eye movement patterns during
three-dimensional (3D) visual object recognition. Here we provide some
evidence that fixation patterns can be used to study local shape processing during three-dimensional (3D) object recognition in human vision.
Participants eye movements were recorded while they either actively
memorized (Exp 1) or passively viewed (Exp 2) sets of novel 3D objects
and later performed a subsequent recognition memory task (test phase).
During the memory task (test phase) previously seen objects were presented amongst visually similar distracters at both previously seen and
novel viewpoints. The distributions of fixation patterns were compared

58

with the distributions predicted by three models of local image processing: (i) low-level visual saliency and (ii) convex and (iii) concave surface
curvature. Analyses of the eye movement data showed preference for
fixation at regions of concave surface curvature minima during both the
pre-test and test phases, and regardless of whether stimuli were actively
or passively viewed in the pre-test phase. There was no evidence that fixation patterns are influenced by visual saliency. The results are interpreted within the context of recent viewpoint-dependent interpolation
models of shape recognition. It is proposed that the fixation patterns
reflect the operation of a depth-sensitive view interpolation process that
is constrained by key points encoding regions of concave curvature minima.

THE ROLE OF PRE-SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA IN THE
COMPUTATION OF ABSTRACT SPATIAL TRANSFORMATIONS Stephen

Johnston1, Charles Leek2; 1Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK, 2Bangor University,
Bangor, UK — A current debate in the literature involves the extent to
which the supplementary motor area (SMA) is recruited specifically for
the planning of motor responses as opposed to supporting motor and
non-motor functions through the computation of spatial transformations. Here we present two functional imaging experiments that attempt
to further elucidate the functional properties of SMA. In Experiment 1,
participants were either shown a starting grid that could be empty
(motor task) or contain a number (subtraction task). Participants then
viewed a series of numbers interspersed with hash marks. In alternating
blocks, participants performed (i) a motor task, where a finger tap was
performed in response to number stimuli, and (ii) a subtraction task,
where participants serially subtracted each number from the number
presented in the starting grid. In Experiment 2, participants viewed a
grid which could be empty (motor task) or contain a highlighted tile
(visual transform task). A sequence of arrow stimuli, interspersed with
hash marks followed. In alternating blocks, participants performed (i) a
motor task, where participants finger tap in response to the arrow stimuli and (ii) a visuo-spatial transform task, where the starting tile moves
one space in the direction indicated by the arrow. Results indicate that
the anterior sub-division of SMA (pre-SMA), responds more strongly to
demands associated with both non-motor tasks compared with the
motor transformation tasks. We conclude that pre-SMA is involved in
the computation of spatial transformations across a variety of cognitive
tasks and its function is not restricted to movement planning.

OCCIPITAL TMS FACILITATES AND HINDERS VISUAL PERCEPTION VIA A
CONTRAST GAIN MECHANISM Francesca Perini1, Luigi Cattaneo1, Marisa

Carrasco3, Jens Schwarzbach1,2; 1Center for Mind/ Brain Sciences, University
of Trento, Italy, 2Department of Cognitive Science and Education, University of
Trento, Italy, 3Department of Psychology and Center for Neural Science, New
York University — The effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
can vary radically according to the state in which the brain is at the
moment of stimulation. Two possible mechanisms by which single magnetic stimuli produce different effects according to the initial activation
state of targeted neurons have been proposed: (i) TMS suppresses neural
signals and (ii) TMS adds random neuronal activity. Here we explore
these two hypotheses by investigating the psychophysical effects of TMS
on early visual cortex under different conditions of contrast adaptation.
We tested six participants in an orientation discrimination task, where
neuronal activation of visual cortex before each trial was altered through
adaptation either to a blank screen or to two flickering gratings. In half of
the trials a single TMS pulse was delivered simultaneously with target.
Adaptation decreased performance. The effect of TMS on performance
depended on the state of adaptation: it increased contrast sensitivity
after adaptation but reduced it in the absence of adaptation. Correspondingly, TMS had a differential effect on threshold according to adaptation:
it increased thresholds without adaptation but decreased them after
adaptation. Notably, TMS did not affect the asymptote in any condition.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Sunday, April 3, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session B
The fact that TMS changed thresholds but not asymptotes suggests that
TMS acts at the input level of neuronal processing, i.e. at the synaptic
level. Moreover, the finding that TMS had opposite effects on the two
adaptation conditions, even at the same performance levels at threshold,
contradicts the hypothesis of TMS state-dependency as a product of
noise increase.

HIGHER PRE-STIMULUS ACTIVITY IN THE DORSAL ATTENTIONAL
NETWORK PARADOXICALLY LEADS TO LOWER CONFIDENCE Dobromir

Rahnev1,2, Floris de Lange2, Hakwan Lau1,2; 1Columbia University, Department
of Psychology, New York, 2Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for
Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Netherlands — One recent study reported

that when pre-stimulus fMRI activity in the dorsal attention network
was high, the hit rate in an auditory detection task was surprisingly low.
This result is puzzling because pre-stimulus activity in the dorsal attention network presumably reflects the subjects’ attentional state, and high
attention is supposed to improve perception, not impair it. However, it is
important to distinguish between the capacity and decision/criterion
aspects of perception. We provide empirical psychophysical to show that
spatial attention can lead to conservation bias in detection, although it
boosts detection capacity. Further studies confirmed the prediction,
derived from signal detection theory, that this conservative bias in detection is coupled with lowered confidence ratings in a discrimination task.
Based on these results, we used fMRI to test the hypothesis that low prestimulus ongoing activity in the dorsal attention network predicts high
confidence ratings in a visual motion discrimination task. The results
confirmed this counter-intuitive prediction, and further revealed that
slow fluctuation at a specific frequency range (.04 - .05Hz) drove this
effect on confidence. Activity at a distinct frequency range (.04 - .08Hz)
drove a similar but opposite effect on accuracy – higher pre-stimulus
activity led to higher accuracy. Taken together, these results support the
notion that attention may have a negative impact on the decision/criterion aspects of perception. This negative relationship may explain various paradoxes like the vividness of peripheral vision and the
overconfidence in naïve subjects in change blindness experiments
despite their poor performance.

B10
THE ROLE OF MOTOR PROGRAMMING IN THE RETRIEVAL OF OBJECT
KNOWLEDGE Heath Matheson1, Patricia McMullen1; 1Psychology
Department, Dalhousie University — Mounting evidence from behavioral
research demonstrates that passively viewing images of tools both
primes motor responses and activates fronto-parietal networks responsible for programming action. To account for these findings, embodied (or
grounded) theories of cognition propose that the same neural networks
are involved in encoding and retrieving object knowledge. However,
most evidence to date has been based on correlations between viewing
manipulable objects and fronto-parietal activity. In the present study, we
investigated whether motor programs play a necessary role in the
retrieval of object knowledge/identity. Participants performed an object
naming task while squeezing a sponge with either their right or left
hand. The objects were either manipulable (e.g. hammer) or non-manipulable (e.g. horse), and were oriented favoring a right or left hand grasp.
If activation of motor programs is necessary to retrieve object knowledge, we hypothesized that this arbitrary motor act would alter object
naming performance, especially for objects oriented towards the occupied hand. Participants showed slower naming for all objects oriented
towards the occupied hand. These results suggest that motor programming can play a role in the retrieval of object knowledge/identity. These
effects were independent of object category and may depend on lowlevel visual characteristics of objects (i.e. an orientation favouring a left
or right hand grasp).

MODELING MECHANISMS OF REVERSED EFFECTS OF MANIPULABILITY
ON NAMING AND CATEGORIZING OBJECTS Joshua Salmon1, Patricia

McMullen1, Thomas Trappenberg2; 1Psychology Department, Dalhousie
University, 2Computer Science Department, Dalhousie University — Our
behavioural research has shown that manipulable objects are named
more quickly and categorized more slowly than non-manipulable
objects (Salmon & McMullen, 2009). This pattern of effects was explored
using extensions of a computational model of Yoon, Heinke and Humphreys’ (2002) Naming Action Model (NAM) by determining the success
of three possible mechanisms to simulate it. The first mechanism was
based on semantic organization of the system (crowded versus sparse
domains) whereby crowded categories (those consisting of many
objects) were postulated to be categorized more quickly and named
more slowly than sparse categories. The second mechanism was more
perceptual, and based on the input of visually similar objects whereby
highly visual similar objects were postulated to be categorized more
quickly and named more slowly. The third mechanism was based on the
effect of a dedicated Action Module postulated in the NAM model to be
active for manipulable but not for non-manipulable objects. This Action
Module was postulated to speed the naming of manipulable objects, but
slow their categorization. Our computational simulation supported a
“reversal effect” due to the first two mechanisms, but not the third.
Hence, a sparse versus crowded semantic architecture and visual similarity of the input objects could account for the “reversal effect” but a
dedicated Action Module could not. These results suggest that actions
associated with objects can affect their identification at specific and nonspecific levels without appealing to a module dedicated to coding these
associations.

MORE OR LESS HUMAN: THE ANIMATE–INANIMATE DISTINCTION IN
VISUAL CORTEX MAY BE MORE CONTINUUM THAN DISTINCTION

Andrew C. Connolly1, J. Swaroop Guntupalli1, M. Ida Gobbini1,2, James V.
Haxby1,3; 1Dartmouth College, 2Università di Bologna, 3University of Trento —
Numerous studies suggest that the animate–inanimate distinction is a
central principle for representing objects in ventral visual cortex. Yet less
is known about the organization of representations within these large
domains. We aimed to investigate the finer structure of representations
within the animate domain using fMRI. We analyzed activity patterns
associated with viewing a range of animal species in a multi-condition
protocol. Our main findings include the observation of two distinct neural similarity structures: one based on low-level visual attributes localized to activity in and around primary visual cortex, and another that
reflects category structure – i.e., superordinate animal classes – most
strongly represented in the ventral temporal (VT) cortex and mirrored in
other regions including lateral occipital, inferior parietal sulcus, and
inferior frontal gyrus. The VT similarity structure is characterized by a
single dominant dimension that separates animal species into their
respective superordinate classes but also suggests a hierarchy among
species with more human-like animals at one end (e.g., monkeys) and
the least human-like animals at the other (e.g., ladybugs). Activationbased contrasts revealed that the invertebrate animals were associated
with greater activity compared to vertebrates in regions typically associated with viewing inanimate objects – i.e., medial fusiform and inferior
temporal gyri, while vertebrates more strongly activated areas normally
associated with animates – lateral fusiform and middle and superior
temporal gyri. These results suggest that the animate-inanimate distinction may actually reflect a continuum – encoding differences not only
between animates and inanimates, but also among exemplars within the
animate domain.

OBJECT SUBSTITUTION REDUCES FACE-SPECIFIC PROCESSING BY
DISRUPTING PRIOR VISUAL PROCESSING IN LOWER-LEVEL SENSORY
CORTEX Joseph Harris1, Solange Ku1, Alex McMahon1, Marty Woldorff1;
1Duke University — In

the relatively recently characterized method of disrupting visual awareness known as object substitution masking (OSM),
delaying the offset of a four-dot cue surrounding a briefly presented target image results in a marked decrement in a viewer’s ability to detect
and categorize the image. This tool for disrupting visual awareness can
be used in conjunction with neuroimaging methods to examine the
extent of visual neural processing that occurs with and without awareness. Although the attenuation of electrophysiological indices of facespecific processing (N170 difference wave) with OSM has been reported,
helping to circumscribe a possible locus of disruption, the specific mechanisms of OSM have yet to be determined. The present experiment
explores these mechanisms by tracking the face-specific N170, as well as
lower-level indices of basic visual processing, across awareness states as
disrupted versus not disrupted by OSM. The face-specific ERP negativity was disrupted by OSM, both at its early N170 phase and at a later
recurrent phase. In addition, with the use of certain control conditions,
we observed a disruption by OSM of reentrant activity associated with
low-level visual processing, temporally localized to ~150 ms after the
onset of the target image. Given the temporal and spatial distribution of
this effect of attenuation, we conclude that object substitution exerts its
disruptive influence by attenuating basic target processing at the level of
early reentrant extrastriate processing, which then ramifies to later
object-category-specific processes reflected by the face-specific N170.

CONTEXT AND HAND POSTURE MODULATE THE NEURAL DYNAMICS OF
TOOL-OBJECT PERCEPTION Nikhilesh Natraj1, Victoria N. Poole2, J.C.

Mizelle1,5, Andrea Flumini3, Anna M. Borghi3,4, Lewis Wheaton1; 1Georgia
Institute of Technology, 2Purdue University, 3University of Bologna, 4Institute of
Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, 5Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical
Center — The human mirror neuron system (MNS) overlaps with brain

areas underlying complex tool-use. Prior research has linked visual perception of tools with plausible motor strategies (action affordances).
Mere observation of tools and a hand functionally grasping a tool activates areas common to MNS and tool-use (left fronto-parietal areas).
However, tool-use movements are performed in specific contexts and
grasp postures. Therefore, we sought to understand how context and
hand grasp postures together modulate action affordances. 64-channel
electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 16 right-handed subjects while viewing images depicting three classes of tool-object Contexts: Functionally Correct (e.g. hammer-nail), Functionally Incorrect
(e.g. hammer-shirt) and Thematic (e.g. hammer-wood). These Contexts
were modified by Hand interactions: No Hand, Hand near the tool,
Functional posture (grasp hammer handle) and Manipulative posture
(grasp hammer head). Subjects visually assessed correctness of toolobject associations. A separate behavioral study recorded reaction times
of this decision process. When Context is Correct, only Manipulative
posture resulted in delayed reaction times and extended time-voltage
activations over right fronto-parietal areas, characterized by a right frontal theta power modulation (p<0.01, [400-600ms], [4-8Hz]). This suggests
engagement of a right neural system to evaluate correct action affordances when Hand posture does not support action (Manipulative).
Additionally, when tool-use Context is ambiguous (Thematic), Manipulative posture alone resulted in delayed perceptual judgment and
extended left motor, bilateral fronto-parietal time-voltage activations,
with beta band power modulations ([p<0.01, [400-600ms], [12-16Hz, 2025Hz]). These results point to existence of other neural networks evaluating tool-object associations when motoric affordances are not readily
apparent.

SHORT PRACTICE ON MENTAL ROTATION AFFECTS SHAPE ENCODING OF
Ganis1,2,3,
NOVEL OBJECTS ALONG THE VENTRAL STREAM Giorgio
Haline Schendan2,3; 1Harvard Medical School, 2Massachusetts General
Hospital, Charlestown, MA, 3University of Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, UK —

Mental rotation processes have been shown to engage both posterior
parietal regions in the dorsal stream, thought to index spatial transformation processes, and occipito-temporal regions in the ventral stream,
thought to index shape-based processes. However, the relative sensitivity of these regions to practice is still not clear. To address this issue, sixteen participants carried out eight runs of mental rotation of realistic 3D
shapes during an fMRI scanning session. All stimuli were different in
order to assess improvement in mental rotation processes per se, rather
than item-specific repetition processes. Regression lines fit through the
behavioral data (angle of rotation versus response times) showed the
typical linear increase in response times as a function of angle of rotation. Practice resulted in faster response times, but, importantly, it did
not decrease the slope of the regression lines, usually believed to index
spatial transformation processes, suggesting that a short practice session
may not affect these processes. The neuroimaging results support this
view. Activation increased linearly with angle of rotation both in
occipito-temporal and posterior parietal cortex. However, practice
effects were found mostly in the ventral stream, where activation
decreased with practice. These results indicate that a short practice session on mental rotation affects mainly shape-based processes, perhaps
involved in the initial encoding the 3D shapes. A longer practice period
may be required to affect spatial transformation processes.

UMRS 975, Paris, France — All primates, including humans, recognise
images in a left-right invariant-way. This mirror-invariance is useful to
recognise objects both from left or right perspectives, but this very competency has to be 'unlearned' for reading acquisition in order to correctly
identify letters (e.g. to distinguish a 'b' from a 'd'). In a first study, we
presented pairs of visual stimuli (faces, houses, tools, strings and falsefonts), whose left-right orientation was manipulated, to adult literates
and illiterates. The task was to judge if the pairs were 'same' or 'different', regardless of orientation (identity task). The subjects were explicitly
instructed to assign 'same' for mirror-inverted pairs. The results showed
an important behavioural cost to respond 'same' in mirror-trials, proportional to the literacy level, but only for strings and falsefonts. A strong
bias to respond 'different' in mirrored-strings was also observed in good
readers but not in illiterates. In a second study (Neuroimage, in press),
we used an fMRI priming paradigm to probe the neural discrimination
of mirror-inverted pairs of stimuli in skilled readers. We demonstrate
that the left occipito-temporal cortex, namely the Visual Word Form
Area (VWFA) distinguishes the left-right orientation of single letters,
and yet exhibits mirror invariance for simple matched pictures. These
results clarify how letter shapes, after reading acquisition, escape the
process of mirror invariance which is a basic property of the ventral
visual shape recognition pathway.

to be related to structural encoding of faces and bodies. The aim of the

Sunday, April 3, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session B
present study was to investigate whether bodies or faces and shredded
faces and bodies elicit the same component. This would imply that even
body parts are encoded as a whole supporting the significance of these
stimuli. According to that, we used a matching to sample task and two
manipulations which were assessed in previous studies: the inversion
effect and intact versus shredded stimulus presentation. For both categories, performance was better for intact compared to shredded stimuli
while this effect could not be observed for houses. Additionally, stimulus distortion seems to affect the perception of bodies disproportionally
greater than the perception of faces. On the electrophysiological level we
found enhanced N170 amplitudes for intact faces and bodies compared
to shredded stimuli. Furthermore, we observed an inversion effect for
intact but not shredded bodies. The current data suggest that faces and
bodies might be processed by distinct mechanisms as the experimental
variation affected bodies more than faces.

Automatique, CNRS UMR 5216, Grenoble, France — Complex natural scenes
are very quickly categorized, faster than 150 ms, suggesting a simple and
efficient processing. Recent models of visual recognition have suggested
that perceptual analysis may start with a parallel extraction of different
spatial frequencies (SF), but using a preferential coarse-to-fine (CtF)
sequence of SF processing. A rapid extraction of low spatial frequencies
(LSF) may thus provide an initial and crude parsing of the scene, subsequently refined by slow but more detailed high spatial frequencies
(HSF). However, a fine-to-coarse (FtC) being sometimes preferred to a
CtF sequence depending on task demands. The present experiment aims
to investigate whether a CtF processing allows faster scene categorization rather than a reverse FtC processing. To constrain SF processing
according to these sequences, we presented brief movies of successive
SF-filtered scenes with opposite SF sequences (either from LSF to HSF, or
the reverse), allowing us to experimentally “decompose” the visual
inputs in either CtF or FtC sequences. Movies last 150 ms and were composed of six SF-images of the same scene, filtered either at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
cycles/degree of visual angle for CtF movies or the reverse for FtC movies. Thirty five participants performed a categorization task (indoors vs.
outdoors) on these movies. Results showed that they categorized CtF
movies significantly faster than FtC movies. Using for the first time
dynamic stimuli, these results provide critical support to recent models
of vision. The current stimuli seem therefore well appropriate to highlight the neural basis of the CtF categorization.

SPATIAL FREQUENCY PROCESSING DURING LARGE NATURAL SCENE

Paris, France, 3INSERM U836/Université Joseph Fourier - Institut des
Neurosciences, Grenoble, France — Recent models suggest that visual
scene recognition is mainly based on parallel extraction of spatial frequencies of an image. Physiological data from humans reveal that low
spatial frequencies (LSF) were mostly extracted from peripheral rods/
parasol ganglion cells whereas high spatial frequencies (HSF) were
mostly extracted from central cones/midget ganglion cells. Then, the
processing of spatial frequencies in early visual areas would be retinotopically mapped. The aim of this fMRI study was to evaluate cerebral
correlates and retinotopic processing of spatial frequencies in the occipital cortex during large natural scene perception. Twelve participants performed a categorization task (indoors vs. outdoors) of black and white

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

photographs of natural scenes filtered in LSF (below 1 cycle per degree
of visual angle) and HSF (above 6 cycles per degree of visual angle),
sized 24°x18° of visual angle, during block-designed fMRI recording sessions. LSF (relative to HSF) scene categorization elicited significant bilateral activations within the medial aspect of the occipital lobe, at the
anterior half of the calcarine fissures, in correspondence with the location of the peripheral representation in the visual cortex. Additional activations were obtained within the left anterior lingual gyrus. HSF
(relative to) LSF scene categorization elicited significant bilateral activations more posteriorly in the occipital lobes, including the cunei, the posterior lingual gyri and the middle occipital gyri, in correspondence with
the foveal representation. These results provide supplementary evidence
for retinotopic mapping of spatial frequency processing at early levels of
visual analysis in human occipital cortex.

INVESTIGATING THE INFLUENCE OF AFFECT AND ENVIRONMENTAL
RELEVANCE ON AWARENESS IN A BINOCULAR RIVALRY PARADIGM
Caitlin J Mouri1, Leandra Desjardins1, Avi Chaudhuri1; 1McGill University — In

binocular rivalry, two conflicting visual stimuli are presented simultaneously to each eye, and subsequently compete for awareness. In this
study, we use the phenomenon of rivalry to examine the influence of
emotional content and environmental relevance on perceptual awareness. Emotional content is known to influence perceptual dominance
through arousal, as emotional images tend to dominate over neutral
images (Alpers, 2007), while positive and negative images compete
equally for access to awareness (Sheth & Pham, 2008). In the absence of
awareness, emotion information can influence behavior through pathways in the amygdala (Carlsson et al., 2004). More generally, these pathways are thought to select for biological relevance (Adolphs, 2008). To
determine whether emotional content can influence rivalry by way of
biological relevance, we selected images from the International Affective
Picture System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1999) associated with
reward or threat. Reward-related images with positive valence and fearrelated images with negative valence were matched on IAPS ratings of
arousal and valence magnitude. Image pairs were presented to each eye
simultaneously to induce rivalry. We found a significant effect of valence
on image dominance, which contradicts previous findings that positive
or negative valence does not alter perceptual awareness (Sheth & Pham,
2008). As our stimuli were specifically selected for image content rather
than valence alone, this provides support for our hypothesis that environmental relevance influences rivalry in conjunction with emotional
salience.

PERCEPTUAL LEARNING OF INVERTED FACES ACROSS DIFFERENT
SPATIAL FREQUENCY BANDS Adélaïde de Heering1, Daphne Maurer1;

McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada., 2McMaster University,
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada — Small amounts of practice can improve accu-

racy for recognizing upright faces. However little is known about the
effects of practice on recognition of inverted faces (1,2). Here we hypothesized that adults might be better at learning to recognize inverted faces
if trained with low spatial frequency images (<5 cpi; LSF) than full spectrum (FULL) or high spatial frequency images (>24 cpi; HSF) since newborns learn to recognize upright faces despite poor visual acuity (3). We
trained 3 groups of 16 adults in a 10-AFC task with LSF, HSF or FULL
inverted faces presented with different viewpoints. Although reaction
times became significantly faster for all groups during training, accuracy
improved only in the FULL (14%) and HSF (7%) groups. Improvements
from before to after training were assessed by comparisons to an
untrained control group on 4 tasks. The FULL group showed more
improvement in both accuracy and reactions time than controls on the
delayed matching task of full spectrum inverted faces, thereby demonstrating generalization of training to novel faces. They were also faster
on the same task with upright faces. The HSF group showed increased
and decreased holistic processing of full spectrum inverted and upright
faces, respectively, as indexed by reaction times on the composite face

effect. Despite no improvement in accuracy during training, the LSF
group improved more than controls on reaction times to match simultaneously presented full-spectrum inverted faces. These results suggest
that perceptual learning of inverted faces and its generalization depend
strongly on their spatial frequency content.

THE PRECISION OF SHORT-TERM MEMORY FOR NATURALISTIC
OBJECTS Michele Veldsman1, Alejandro Vicente-Grabovetsky1, Rhodri

Cusack1; 1Medical Research Council, Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit —

Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is important for many everyday cognitive tasks, but its capacity is highly restricted. Our work aims to examine the neural basis of this limitation. Recent studies have begun to
distinguish two limits, the number of items that can be remembered, and
the precision with which each is remembered. Participants perform a
whole report task in which they are asked to select a probed item from
many possibilities, instead of simply detecting a change. We extend this
in two ways. First, we use fMRI to investigate the neural basis of precision and object number limits. Second, we adapt the report paradigm to
naturalistic objects, which recruit a wider range of visual representations
and are more relevant for everyday memory performance. A parameterised circular continuum for each stimulus was created ranging from its
original intact state to a heavily distorted state. We estimated the capacity and precision of memory representations for complex and naturalistic objects. We found that meaningful objects are remembered with
higher resolution than distorted objects. Using fMRI, we found that
unlike previous results from simple stimuli, varying the number of complex objects does not change the recruitment of the ventral (occipito-temporal) and parietal visual (superior intraparietal sulcus) regions. This is
presumably because even remembering a single complex object, to the
precision required for a report task, can fully consume all visual memory
resources. However, remembering two objects recruited a fronto-parietal
multiple demands network, presumably due to the demand of maintaining distinct objects.

JUDGING 'NATURALNESS' OF DEPTH IN STEREOSCOPIC AND
PSEUDOSCOPIC PICTURES - EXAMINING DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN
ACTIVITY USING FUNCTIONAL MRI Norberto Eiji Nawa1, Hiroshi Ando1;
1National

Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT),
Kyoto, Japan — Binocular disparity is one of several cues used by the

human visual system to perceive depth. Though several brain regions
have been found to selectively respond to binocular disparity and to be
associated more generally with processes related to the perception of
depth, little is known about the regions involved in the perception and
judgment of the quality of perceived depth, for instance, when viewing
images in artificial settings such as 3D displays and movies. We were
particularly interested in the quality of ‘naturalness’, i.e., the notion of
how similar the experience of depth enabled by stereoscopic displays is
to what one encounters in real life. To investigate that, we measured
hemodynamic brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants classified the ‘naturalness’ of depth of pictures under stereoscopic (left and right images displayed to the
respective eyes), pseudoscopic (left and right images displayed to the
opposite eyes), and monoscopic (same image displayed to both eyes)
conditions. Participants used a three-alternative scale to grade the pictures (Natural/Unnatural/Neither one), which portrayed six daily life
objects in grayscale, aligned in the same plane with one object partially
occluding another. We examined neural responses in a priori regions
specified in a previous block design study using similar images. Comparing event-related responses evoked by pseudoscopic stimuli against
stereoscopic stimuli, we found a focus of increased activity in the left
superior frontal gyrus. These results strongly indicate a major involvement of frontal areas in the judgment of depth quality in stereo images.

DYNAMIC AND STATIC FACIAL EXPRESSIONS DECODED FROM FACIAL
MOVEMENT SENSITIVE AREAS IN THE MACAQUE Nicholas Furl1, Fadila

Hadj-bouziane2, Ning Liu2, Bruno Averbeck1, Leslie Ungerleider2; 1Laboratory
of Neuropsychology, NIMH/NIH, 2Laboratory of Brain and Cognition, NIMH/
NIH — Many animals including humans visually communicate important
social cues via facial movements such as emotional expressions.
Although expressions are dynamic, the role of motion representation in
expression perception is not yet specified. The macaque provides a
model neural system, as its superior temporal sulcus (STS) possesses discrete brain areas selective for static faces as well as areas sensitive to biological and low-level motion. We carried out functional magnetic
resonance imaging while monkeys viewed static and dynamic monkey
faces with specific emotional expressions. Using multivariate analysis,
we found that information about facial expressions could be robustly
decoded only from areas sensitive to facial movement; whereas faceselective patches, defined as areas responsive to faces versus places and
objects contained relatively little information about facial expressions.
Interestingly, the areas sensitive to facial movement showed weak
responses to static faces, but still contained more information about
static expressions than face selective patches. Although facial movement
areas located in posterior and middle STS resembled areas already
known to be sensitive to low-level motion (translating dots and optic
flow), the dynamic face stimuli also revealed another, more anterior
facial movement area. Importantly, facial movement areas coded
dynamic and static presentations of the same expressions using distinct
response patterns. Our results raise the possibility that motion representation contributes to perception of both dynamic and static facial expressions and show that dynamic and static expressions are associated with
separate neural codes.

TRACING A SPATIAL THOUGHT VIA EEG IN A SEQUENTIAL MENTAL
ROTATION TASK Heinrich R. Liesefeld1, Hubert D. Zimmer1; 1Saarland
University, Germany — The value of orientation dependent information
changes as a stimulus is rotated, while the value of orientation independent information does not. We earlier found behavioral evidence that in
mental rotation tasks only orientation dependent but not orientation
independent spatial relational information (let alone a visual representation) is actually rotated. In a sequential mental rotation task specially
designed to manipulate the amounts of these two types of information
we expected to find electrophysiological markers for the differential processing of these information types. Findings include: (1) As stimuli are
initially encoded visually, the P300 to the initial stimulus is sensitive to
visual complexity only. (2) The amount of to be performed rotation influences the amplitude of the P300 following the onset of the rotation cue
and that of the ensuing slow wave. (3) As only orientation dependent
information is actually rotated, only the amount of this type of information influences the shape of the rotation related slow wave. (4) As orientation independent information is not included in the representation that
is rotated, it is not readily accessible for comparison at the onset of the
target stimulus. Therefore, detection of a non-match in orientation independent information takes longer than detection of other non-matches.
This becomes evident in both decision times and P300 latencies. Taken
together, this study neatly exemplifies the tracing of encoding, manipulation and comparison processes involved in mental rotation via EEG
and provides converging evidence for the claim that mental rotation
works on a representation that includes orientation dependent information only.

tional awareness? In two studies, we examined the relative contributions
of action-related top-down activation versus salient bottom-up perceptual signals to the conscious detection of backward masked visual stimuli (targets). Following the technique of Pessiglione et al. (2008),
backward masking was employed to render visual targets (nonsense
shapes) subliminal. Building on previous research showing that actionrelated processing can influence release from masking, Study 1 (n = 19)
investigated whether performing a motion (e.g., rotating the hand) that
was similar in nature (isomorphic) to a target (e.g., a circular shape)
could cause a backward masked target to enter conscious awareness. We
found no effect of isomorphic action, F(1, 18) = .607, p > .05. In a second
study (n = 54), we contrasted the effects of action-related top-down activation (a button-press that seemed to cause the appearance of targets)
and a salient bottom-up cue (a red square around the first pattern mask)
and found that the bottom-up cue, but not the causal action, significantly
increased entry of the target into attentional awareness, F(1, 51) = 34.593,
p < .001. Together, these findings support theoretical frameworks proposing that entry into awareness is mediated primarily by perceptuallyrelated processing.

BRAIN ORGANIZATION OF EXPERT PERCEPTION IN CHESS Amy

L.
Boggan1, Daniel C. Krawczyk1,2, James C. Bartlett1; 1The University of Texas at
Dallas, 2UT Southwestern Medical Center — Chess, long a fascination of cognitive science, provides an ideal context for studying visual expertise.
Chess expertise is quantified by a reliable rating system (the Elo system)
based on demonstrated performance. Chess experts are able to parse
complex relationships among the pieces in a game display in seconds.
Since chess pattern recognition has important similarities (necessity of
both part-based and configural processing) and differences (no fixed
first-order configuration or biological characteristics) with face recognition, we have begun to explore whether face recognition and expert
chess recognition might rely on similar or shared networks. In the
present study, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was conducted as chess experts (Grandmaster and International Masters rated
2447-2564), mid-level tournament players (rated 1332-1634), and chess
novices viewed faces, outdoor scenes, everyday objects, and chess game
displays in a one-back recognition task. Some game displays were drawn
from real games while others represented randomized configurations of
pieces. Novices reported no ability to differentiate between real and
scrambled chess displays. Functional MRI contrasts allowed us to identify areas associated with perceiving faces, scenes and chess games. For
experts, viewing chess games was associated with relative activation in
the posterior occipital cortex, medial parietal cortex, and regions of the
visual association cortex compared with other stimulus categories. Additionally, experts displayed more activation in the medial and lateral
occipital cortex when viewing real games as compared to randomized
chess displays. These findings suggest that expert game perception
involves distinct, separate neural populations than those associated with
face recognition.

BILATERAL FUNCTIONAL AND ANATOMICAL CONNECTIVITY PREDICTING
PERFORMANCE IN A DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION TASK Ehsan Shokri

Kojori1, Ilana Bennett1, Michael Motes1,2, Daniel Krawczyk1,2, Bart Rypma1,2;

The University of Texas at Dallas, 2University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center at Dallas — Functional connectivity analyses can be used to assess
correlations between brain regions engaged during cognitive tasks.
Moreover, anatomical connectivity analyses investigate neuronal pathways underlying these functional networks. The extent to which connectivity measures, particularly associations between bilateral regions,
contribute to task performance remains poorly understood. During functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, participants (n=21, 18-27 years old)
performed a modified Digit Symbol Substitution Task, within which an
array containing nine digit-symbol pairs appeared above a single digitsymbol probe. Participants indicated whether the probe pair matched a
digit-symbol pair from the array. Clusters of significant group-level

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

activity were selected for further connectivity analyses (z=2.3, cluster
threshold: p<0.01, at least 10mm apart). Functional connectivity was
assessed by correlating time-series corresponding to bilateral clusters
within prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, occipital cortex, motor cortex, and
cerebellum. The square of these correlation coefficients was used to
index Similarity in Bilateral Activity (SIBA). Anatomical connectivity
was assessed with Diffusion Tensor Imaging tractography between the
bilateral clusters. Results revealed correlations between accuracy and
SIBA in cerebellum (r=-0.53, p=0.01) and occipital cortex (r=-0.38,
p=0.08). A negative correlation between response-time and SIBA in frontal pole regions indicated that fast performers exhibit more synchrony in
activity across frontal poles (r=-0.57, p=0.007). However, higher integrity
(Fractional Anisotropy) of the tract connecting bilateral frontal pole
regions was associated with lower accuracy (r=-0.42, p=0.06).These
results suggest that functional and anatomical connectivity analyses can
differentially predict performance measures (e.g. accuracy, responsetime) and provide new insights into neural mechanisms mediating individual differences in task performance.

GAMMA OSCILLATIONS REFLECT GOAL-DIRECTED MODULATION OF
NEURAL ACTIVITY IN OCCIPITAL AND PARAHIPPOCAMPAL REGIONS

Melanie Cohn1,2, Cornelia McCormick1,2, MaryPat McAndrews1,2, Andrea B.
Protzner1,2, Taufik A. Valiante1,2; 1Krembil Neuroscience Centre and Toronto
Western Research Institute, 2University of Toronto — Previous studies have

demonstrated attentional modulation of primary and of associative
visual areas. In one fMRI study (Gazzaley et al.,1995, JOCN), both
enhancement and reduction of the BOLD signal in parahippocampal
gyrus (PHG) when viewing scenes was observed with variations of task
instructions. Here, we investigate the oscillatory underpinnings of these
attentional modulations using intracranial EEG in one patient with electrode coverage encompassing the left occipital lobe and PHG. We used a
working memory task in which faces and scenes were presented under
three types of instructions: 1) Scenes relevant (faces irrelevant), 2) scenes
irrelevant (faces relevant), 3) passive viewing. Power spectral analyses of
the PHG electrode revealed that the enhancement (scenes relevant>passive) and suppression (scenes passive>irrelevant) effects were associated
with an increase and decrease of gamma power respectively in the first
200ms after stimulus presentation. These modulations were specific to
viewing scenes, not faces. Increases in gamma power with attentional
enhancement was also observed in the occipital electrode, but no
decrease was noted for the suppression effect (relevant>irrelevant>passive). Here, no material specificity was observed. Our results indicate
that the goal-directed effects on down-stream visual areas manifest as
changes in gamma oscillations, which are thought to represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The dissociation between primary and
associative visual areas with respect to the suppression effect may be
related to the presence/absence of material or object specialization in
these regions.

CONCEPTUAL TASKS ACTIVATE PERCEPTUAL NETWORKS BETWEEN 150250MS David Brang1, Vilayanur S. Ramachandran1, Mingxiong Huang1,
Seana Coulson1; 1University of CA, San Diego — Research

suggests that
access to conceptual color information engages regions in the temporal
lobe highly responsive to perceptual colors. However, as fMRI is unable
to track the time-course of neural activity, the stage at which this activation occurs is unknown. In order to understand the time-course of objectbased information and whether these concepts elicit activity in modality
specific perceptual regions, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was
recorded while subjects performed color and action property verification
tasks. Each trial began with either a color or action word, followed by an
object word (e.g. orange – basketballs; throw – basketballs), and subjects
were instructed to press a button when the attribute failed to match common properties of the object (50% of trials). Additionally, to precisely
localize activity within visual area V4, each subject underwent an MEG
retinotopy task. Extending previous findings, results showed dissociable

63

Poster Session B — Sunday, April 3, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse
perceptual networks for color and action properties. Specifically, colorbased judgments elicited enhanced activity in visual cortex, particularly
in color area V4, and action properties differentially activated classic
motor areas, including primary motor cortex and the inferior frontal
gyrus, along with regions in the superior temporal sulcus and the inferior parietal lobe. Activation of these networks began between 150250ms, revealing a fast engagement of regions typically reserved for sensory processing. These MEG data reveal modality specific brain activation during the initial stages of word processing, consistent with models
that posit an important role for perceptual networks in conceptual tasks.

DISSOCIATION BETWEEN GENERAL HOLISTIC PROCESSING AND
HOLISTIC FACE PROCESSING: EVIDENCE FROM THREE CASES OF
ACQUIRED PROSOPAGNOSIA Thomas Busigny1,2, Bruno Rossion1;
1University

of Louvain, Belgium, 2University of British Columbia, Canada —

Many studies have shown that acquired prosopagnosia is characterized
by impairment at holistic/configural processing (e.g., Levine & Calvanio, 1989). However, it is not clear whether this holistic processing
impairment is general or can be specific for faces, at least in some cases.
Here we tested three cases of acquired prosopagnosia who have preserved object recognition: PS (Rossion et al., 2003), LR (Bukach et al.,
2006) and GG (Busigny et al., 2010). These patients were tested with the
Navon hierarchical letters, testing general holistic processing, and two
tests measuring holistic face processing, the face inversion effect and the
whole-part advantage. We show that the three patients present with an
entirely normal response profile in the Navon task: they are as fast as
controls and they have a normal global-to-local interference during identification of local letters. In contrast, the three patients do not present
with the normal effects in the holistic face processing tasks: they have
neither a face inversion effect, nor a whole-part face advantage. Thus, all
three patients appear to encode facial information feature-by-feature,
independently of the other features embedded in the whole facial context. These observations indicate that general holistic processing as measured with global/local interference in the Navon paradigm is
functionally distinct from the ability to perceive an individual face holistically. Moreover, they show that brain damage in adulthood may lead
to selective recognition impairment for faces, because this is the only category of visual items for which holistic processing at a fine-grained
(individual) level is necessary.

INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM SHOW A SELECTIVE DEFICIT FOR THE
UNDERSTANDING OF INTERACTING ANIMATED OBJECTS Nicole David1,

Johannes Schultz2, Kai Vogeley3, Andreas Engel1; 1Department of
Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology, University Medical Center HamburgEppendorf, 2Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, 3Department of
Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Cologne — A focus on social deficits in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has, for a long time, obscured
the existence of lower-level perceptual abnormalities, although the earliest descriptions of autism included abnormalities in oculomotor behavior and visual attention. More recently, however, abnormalities in
perception and attention have increasingly been discussed as influential
factors in ASD-specific psychopathology. To this end, the perception of
coherent motion in random-dot kinematograms, biological motion in
point-light walkers and agency in animated shapes have been investigated in ASD but their relationship remains a matter of debate. It also is
unclear whether ASD-related deficits result from difficulties in global
motion perception or in processing motion that contains socially relevant
signals (e.g. a body and actions). We tested 18 individuals with highfunctioning autism and 16 age-, gender- and IQ-matched control participants, who performed three tasks on a continuum of motion cues and
social complexity: (1) low-level translational motion that moved up or
down, (2) complex motion of a single dot that moved in an animate or
inanimate way, (3) complex motion of two dots that interacted or not.
None of these tasks contained objects with human shape and only the

64

first task contained global motion. Participants with autism were selectively impaired in detecting social interaction between two animated
shapes (task 3), while low-level motion processing (task 1) and the detection of isolated agents (task 2) were preserved. These findings suggest a
distinct social impairment in ASD in understanding interacting agents.

THE ASYMMETRY OF THE OPTIMAL VIEWING POSITION: IS EARLY VISUAL
PROCESSING ASYMMETRIC? AN ERPS STUDY Wen-Hsuan
Chan1,

Thomas P. Urbach1, Marta Kutas1,2; 1University of California, Cognitive
Science, San Diego, 2University of California, Neurosciences, San Diego —

Visual word recognition is faster and more accurate when fixating at a
left-of-center position within a word (the optimal viewing position,
OVP). Some researchers have attributed OVP asymmetry to left hemispheric language dominance. OVP asymmetry, however, may not be
language specific reflecting instead a more general property of early
visual processing. We thus investigated the asymmetry of visual processing using behavioral and scalp-recorded event-related brain potential, ERP measures, as a first step toward answering this question.
Participants were asked to detect a target letter embedded in a nonwordlike letter string presented either spanning fixation or non-foveally
lateralized to one or the other visual field (VF). Recognition accuracy
dropped-off with target distance from fixation, more so in the left- than
right-VF. Other effects that also were more pronounced in the left-VF
were lower accuracy, the greater the number of letters in the target’s VF
and the greater the target distance from fixation. Over non-occipital sites,
the P2 was smaller and later for lateralized than for bilaterally-symmetric stimuli. The occipital N190 to bilaterally-symmetric stimuli was
asymmetric -- larger over the right than left hemisphere. The N190 onset
and peaked earlier for foveally-lateralized than for bilaterally-symmetric
stimuli, over contralateral occiput. For non-foveally-lateralized stimuli,
the N190 was larger over contralateral than ipsilateral occiput, with
smaller ipsilateral amplitudes relative to those for bilaterally-symmetric
stimuli. These systematic changes as a function of stimulus foveation,
lateralization and visual fields, suggest that electrophysiological investigations of this type may prove useful to an understanding of the asymmetry of OVP.

DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTIVENESS
ON FACE LEARNING AND ITS NEURAL CORRELATES Claudia Schulz1,

Alexander Kurt1, Juergen M. Kaufmann1, Stefan R. Schweinberger1; 1University
of Jena, Germany — Distinctive faces are easier to learn and recognize than
typical faces. We used spatial caricaturing to investigate effects of natural compared to artificial distinctiveness on performance and neural correlates of face learning. Naturally distinctive faces and spatial caricatures
of other faces (matched for rated distinctiveness) were identified in a
pilot study. In a blocked learning paradigm, we presented naturally distinctive, non-distinctive, and caricatured faces that were later recognized
among novel faces in a face familiarity test. We presented different pictures of the same identity at learning and test to avoid picture learning.
A main effect of distinctiveness indicated higher accuracy for naturally
distinctive than for spatially caricatured faces, which in turn were recognized better than non-distinctive faces. Reaction times showed a similarly clear advantage of naturally distinctive faces. During learning, both
types of distinctive faces compared to non-distinctive ones elicited more
negative occipitotemporal ERPs during the P200 and N250 time windows. During recognition, only naturally distinctive learned faces elicited a more negative N250. Overall, although both types of
distinctiveness seemed to affect face encoding in a similar manner during learning, spatial caricaturing alone is not sufficient to elicit recognition benefits similar to those caused by natural distinctiveness.

CATEGORICAL REPRESENTATION OF VISUALLY SUPPRESSED OBJECTS
IN VISUAL CORTEX Gideon Caplovitz1,2, Michael Arcaro2, Sabine Kastner2;

1University of Nevada Reno, 2Princeton University — The
relationship
between the fMRI-derived object representations and the conscious
experience of a particular object remains poorly understood. Recent
studies suggest that in the absence of awareness, specific cortical regions
differentially represent different objects categories. However, drawing
strong conclusions about a categorical representation within specific
brain regions is difficult since these studies have focused only on pairs of
object categories and constrained analyses to very restricted and/or
loosely defined regions of cortex Here, we applied fMRI combined with
continuous flash suppression to investigate representations of visually
suppressed objects across occipital, parietal, and temporal cortex, including faces, houses, tools and scrambled objects in our analyses. Univariate
and multivariate (MVPA) analyses were conducted within functionally
defined retinotopic areas: V1, V2, V3, V4 and V3A/B, V7, IPS1-5, SPL1
and object category areas: OFA, FFA, PPA, LOC and EBA. In the invisible conditions, univariate analyses found no differences in BOLD signal
across object category in any ROI. In contrast, the MVPA yielded abovechance performance classifying the four image categories within the FFA
and PPA as well as IPS2, IPS3, IPS4 and IPS5. However, secondary pairwise MVPA revealed that this performance was largely mediated by differentiating between intact and scrambled images in all but the FFA in
which faces could be dissociated from houses. However, within the FFA
the MVPA could not dissociate faces from tools or scrambled pictures.
We therefore find little evidence for categorical representation of suppressed images and reveal an intermediate 'intactness' stage of representation in both the ventral and dorsal streams.

THE BINDING RING: CONFIGURAL CONSTRAINTS ON SIZE
PERCEPTION J. Daniel McCarthy1, Colin Kupitz1, Gideon P. Caplovitz1;
1University of Nevada, Reno — Our

percept of an object’s size arises from
the integration multiple sources of visual information including retinal
size, perceived distance and relative size. This constructive process is
revealed through a number of classic illusions such as the Mueller-Lyer
illusion, the Ebbinghaus illusion and those illustrating size constancy.
Here we present a novel size illusion that we have named the Binding
Ring Illusion that is not easily explained by existing models of size perception. The perceived radius of a circular array of elements will be
smaller if an additional circle is superimposed upon the array. Methods:
Using the method of constant stimuli, observers were presented with
two arrays (one with a binding ring and one without), and asked to
decide which was bigger. The results of Experiment 1 indicate the influence of the binding ring is quite strong and consistent across subjects. In
experiments 2 and 3 we investigated possible role of occlusion and depth
ordering of the binding ring. Paradoxically, the results of the latter two
experiments suggest that the size distortion depends upon the entire
binding ring being visible and consistent with it being in front of the
array. We consider the results of the current study in context of models
of size perception.

THE CAUSAL ROLE OF IPS IN VISUAL CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE: A
FUNCTIONALLY-GUIDED TMS INVESTIGATION Chiara Mazzi1, Francesca

Mancini1, Silvia Savazzi1; 1University of Verona — In a recent study we found
that TMS applied over the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), can generate contralateral static phosphenes. One important question is whether IPS
phosphenes are uniquely generated by the parietal cortex, independently from the contribution of occipital areas. To answer this question
we better characterized the parietal phosphenes to find possible differences in terms of detection threshold (PT), eccentricity, size, vividness
and brightness with those evoked by stimulation of the occipital cortex.
Single-pulse magnetic stimulations were administered with a 90 mm figure-of-eight coil, assisted by an optical neuronavigational system. Indi-

vidual stimulation sites were functionally identified in a region within a
circle of 2 cm of diameter centered on P3 or O1 by stimulating with
supra-threshold intensities. To determine PT the “method of constant
stimuli” was used. In addition, subjects were requested to make drawings of the phosphenes as to obtain the exact eccentricity and size and to
rate their sensation with respect to the vividness and brightness of previous evoked perceptions on a scale (from 1 to 10). Eleven subjects participated in the study. Results showed that the PT was reliably lower for
occipital (64.7% of maximum stimulator output, MSO) than for parietal
(76.3% of MSO) TMS stimulation. Also, eccentricity, size and perceptual
features were modulated by the stimulation sites. These findings corroborate out hypothesis that parietal cortex can be an independent neural
generator of phosphenes. These data are in line with fMRI data proving
the existence of small visually responsive areas in parietal lobes.

THE BLURRING OF BODY TIME AFTER RIGHT IPL GLIOMA RESECTION
Silvia Savazzi1, Barbara Emanuele1, Barbara Santini1,2, Andrea Talacchi1,2,
Giada Zoccatelli2, Franco Alessandrini2; 1University of Verona, 2Borgo Trento
Major Hospital, Verona — In the Libet’s task subjects are asked to push a

button at the time of their own choosing and to report the position of a
clock’s hand when they first make a decision to move. This task can thus
tap the ability to consciously identify the instant in time when an intention to move emerges. Again, if a rubber-hand and the subject’s (hidden)
hand are stroked, repeatedly and synchronously, the subject feels as if
the rubber-hand were part of her/his own body. Importantly, this effect
disappears if the stimulation is asynchronous, indicating a strict time
window for this illusion to emerge. Here, a 43 years old right-handed
woman was asked to perform both tasks before and after resection of a
right inferior parietal lobe glioma. With the Libet’s task, before surgery
the patient estimated the time she first intended to move 306 ms in
advance of the movement onset (estimate of movement execution -73
ms); after surgery, however, the time of the intention to move (-96 ms)
and the time of the movement execution (-68 ms) were estimated close to
that of movement onset. With the rubber-hand illusion (RHI), before surgery a RHI for both hands was found for synchronous stimulation only.
However, after surgery, for the left (contralesional) hand the illusion was
also present for asynchronous stimulation. These data show that a right
IPL lesion can affect body time, both in terms of awareness of motor
intentions and of the integration in time of visual and somatosensory
information.

B39
FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE A MANIPULATED TARGET DURING SEARCH
Grayden Solman1, Daniel Smilek1; 1University of Waterloo — Two

experiments were conducted using a novel search paradigm, in which observers use the mouse to sort through a ‘stack’ of items to locate the target. In
these experiments we find that with surprising frequency observers will
select and move the target during search, but fail to recognize it. In these
cases, where the target has been errantly rejected, subsequent search is in
some cases both slower and less efficient than on comparable non-miss
trials. The experiments presented show that the prevalence of this error
is not influenced by either set size or dual task manipulations. However,
both the prevalence and the consequences of the error are greater when
observers search among items that require focal inspection to be identified. We argue that this is a novel kind of performance error, arising
from the embodied character of the search task. In particular, we suggest
that the error reflects a dissociation between the perceptual processes
responsible for sampling the available information in the display, and
the motor processes responsible for rearranging the display to make
more information available. We propose that the error occurs when these
two processes operate on different items, a situation made more likely by
increasing the similarity between targets and distractors, forcing perceptual processes to use focal inspection, while motor processes may operate on both focal and peripheral items.

WHO DID WHAT? THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TOOL AFFORDANCE AND
THE SENSE OF AGENCY IN THE EXTRASTRIATE BODY AREA Hyojeong

B42
PREFRONTAL ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTING TO REWARD EXPLORATION

we interact with the other people or objects, the brain continuously
updates our own body schema to recognize the agent of observed
actions. The Extrastriate Body Area (EBA) provides an initial interface
for the sense of agency by integrating visual inputs of body parts with
internal signals related to self-generated body movements. Less is
known, however, about how the functional use of tools contributes to
such processes. Here, we investigated whether tool-specific affordance
would differentially affect the neural responses in the EBA depending on
the agency of imaginary actions. In each trial we presented a picture of
an object in a rectangular frame. Objects were either the tools typically
brought towards the body (body tools; e.g., cup, earphones) or away
from the body (world tool; e.g., pen, dice; Rueschemeyer et al., 2010).
Depending on the color of the frame, participants imagined either themselves or the other person using the tool (self vs. other conditions). These
four types of trials were randomly intermixed with blank trials. As
results, independently localized EBA regions of interest showed greater
activation when participants imagined themselves using body tools than
using world tools whereas no such differential activations were found
when they imagined the other person using the tools. The postscan test
revealed no significant difference in vividness of imagery between the
self and other conditions. Our results suggest that the EBA incorporates
functional affordance of tools into the body schema in order to enhance
the sense of agency and to guide our own actions.

determine the EEG reflections of exploratory decisions and reward feedback evaluation in a reinforcement learning task. Participants performed
a “time-conflict” task in which reward frequency, magnitude, and
expected value varied as a function of response time, requiring exploration to discover the optimal response. Previous work has suggested that
participants make exploratory response time adjustments in the direction of greater outcome uncertainty, and that this uncertainty-driven
exploration varies as a function of prefrontal activation and genotype.
However, the timecourse of uncertainty computations, and their relation
to neural signatures of feedback evaluation, remain unknown. To quantify uncertainty and reward expectation, a reinforcement learning model
was fit to individual participant responses. Model fits indicated that participants adjusted responses in the direction of greater outcome uncertainty. Relative uncertainty was associated with broad frontopolar and
lateral frontal power increases during response decision times, fitting
with previous fMRI findings. Mediofrontal ERP components to feedback
(N2,P3,N4) showed a clear distinction whereby negative prediction error
(PE) signals were larger than positive PE signals. Replicating previous
studies, the degree of negative PE significantly correlated with mediofrontal theta power. Unlike previous studies and unlike the ERP findings, the degree of positive PE significantly correlated with mediofrontal
theta power, with an additional significant relationship with mediocentral delta. These findings suggest that there are a multitude of overlapping effects that contribute to EEG signatures of learning and
exploration. Anterior frontal areas appear to contribute to pre-response
exploratory decisions whereas mediofrontal areas contribute to postresponse performance evaluations.

AUTOMATIC PROCESSING OF POLITICAL PREFERENCES IN THE HUMAN
BRAIN Anita Tusche1, John-Dylan Haynes1; 1Bernstein Center for
Computational Neuroscience Charité - Universitätsmedizin, Berlin — Political
preferences are widely assumed to be based on rational and thoughtful
deliberations. However, recent evidence indicates that preferences might
be considerably influenced by fast, automatic processes. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we investigated whether brain
responses during automatic processing and automatic mental associations could be used to reveal individual political preferences. More precisely, the study tested whether neural activation patterns obtained
during implicit processing of faces of famous politicians encode preferences for associated political parties. To address this question, 18 participants were instructed to perform a demanding visual fixation task while
their brain responses were measured. From time to time, task-irrelevant
faces of German politicians were presented in the background of the
screen. Subsequent to scanning, explicit and implicit measures of party
preference as well as face-specific valuation ratings were obtained.
Importantly, during the acquisition of brain responses participants were
naïve about the necessity of these subsequent preference judgments and
were busy performing the fixation task. Multivariate pattern classification was then applied to search for brain areas that contain reliable information on party preferences. Activation patterns in the dorsomedial
Prefrontal Cortex (dmPFC) were found to contain stable information on
preferred and non-preferred political parties associated with politicians
presented in the experiment. Moreover, average neural responses within
this brain region showed strong linear correlations specifically with
implicit measures of party-preference (D-score of Implicit Association
Test). This reliable information on party-preference in the dmPFC might
reflect automatic mental associations triggered by the task-irrelevant
faces of politicians.

WHY DO WE VALUE FREEDOM? GENETIC POLYMORPHISM PREDICTS
THE IMPACT OF CHOICE ON LEARNING Jeffrey Cockburn1, Michael J.

Frank1; 1Brown University — It is typically assumed that prediction errors
encoded by the midbrain dopamine system provide a global learning
signal to the basal ganglia. However, unstructured learning signals such
as these can result in poor spatial credit assignment, with prediction
error signals assigning credit (or blame) to neural populations that
should not be associated with the unpredicted outcome. We hypothesise
that the basal ganglia helps solve its own credit assignment problem by
imposing a structure upon prediction errors targeting the striatum via
disinhibitory projections from basal ganglia output onto neurons in midbrain dopamine system. We investigate this hypothesis by examining
individual learning differences in a variant of a probabilistic learning
task that has been associated with polymorphisms of genes expressed in
striatum. During a training phase, pairs of stimuli were presented and
participants were asked to learn their reward contingencies. Half of the
stimulus pairs could be freely sampled, whereas sampling in remaining
pairs was forced. Our results revealed an effect of gene group on task
performance and on the structure of the Q-learning model that best
explained trial-by-trial performance in line with our proposed hypothesis such that participants with increased basal ganglia gating exhibited
benefits of superior spatial credit assignment. These results suggest that
decisions improve spatial credit assignment, and thus provide a potential explanation for the apparent inherent reward of the freedom to
choose.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Sunday, April 3, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session B
The study has two objectives: First, does the brain compute value automatically, or are values only computed at the time of choice? We also ask
a methodological question: can BOLD signals acquired during passive
viewing of choice items be used to predict subsequent choices? 17 hungry subjects passively viewed images of foods during functional imaging. After scanning, the subjects made choices from pairs of the foods
shown in the scanner. We extracted the BOLD signals corresponding to
each food and used these signals together with subject choices to train a
penalized logistic classifier to predict out-of-sample choices from BOLD
signals. The classification procedure correctly predicted greater than
60% of subjects’ choices (between subject average). This average prediction rate is significantly better than chance. On an individual level, prediction rates for a majority of subjects were significantly greater than
chance at a 5% threshold. These results suggest that neural activity during passive viewing contains information that is predictive of future
choices. The results provide evidence that the brain automatically
encodes components of value, and that these components are both
observable and predictive of choices.

Computation and Neural Systems, California Institute of Technology — A
large number of studies have shown that the vmPFC encodes stimulus
value signals at the time of decision-making. We used human fMRI to
investigate the influence of perceptual awareness on value computation.
Specifically, we asked if perceptual awareness was necessary for the
neural computation of stimulus value, and if not, whether similar networks are involved in computing stimulus value in both the presence
and absence of perceptual awareness. Participants completed two tasks.
In Experiment 1, they viewed aversive or appetitive food items and indicated how much they would like to eat them. In Experiment 2, we used
forward and backward masking to induce perceptual invisibility. The
same food items from Experiment 1 were presented twice (visibly and
invisibly) and the same participants were asked again to rate how much
they would like to eat each food item. Participants were asked to make
these decisions naturally by focusing on whatever freely came to their
mind for both visible and invisible trials. For visible trials, we found that
neural activity in the vmPFC and ventral striatum correlated with each
participant’s subjective value for food items collected in Experiment 1.
For invisible trials, although participants’ behavioral rating was at
chance level, neural activity in these regions again reflected the participant’s decisions from Experiment 1. In sum, we found that similar networks are involved in computing the stimulus value at the time of
decision-making both in the presence and absence of perceptual awareness.

VISUAL FIXATIONS AND PURCHASING DECISIONS Ian

Krajbich1,
Dingchao Lu1, Antonio Rangel1; 1Caltech — We now know that visual fixations play a crucial role in two-item and multi-item choice by biasing the
drift-diffusion choice process towards the item that is being fixated.
Here, we investigate whether visual fixations play a similar role in purchasing decisions. In the first stage of the experiment, subjects reveal
their values for 50 different consumer goods using an incentive-compatible BDM auction. In the second stage (300 trials), subjects see one of the
items and one of six random prices. Their decision is whether to purchase the item at that price. During these decisions we record subjects’
eye movements at 50Hz, as well as their choices and reaction times. We
then use maximum likelihood estimation on the choices and reaction
times to fit a modified drift-diffusion model where there is more evidence accumulated for an option when it is fixated than when it is not
fixated. The naïve hypothesis was that purchasing decisions would obey
the same drift-diffusion process as with two-item or multi-item choice,
since the unchosen item(s) can be thought of as an opportunity cost,

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

analogous to a real dollar cost. Instead, we find that the decision process
in purchasing decisions is substantially different. We no longer find a
strong drift bias due to visual fixations. As before, we find that final item
fixations are shorter than the other item fixations, cut short by barriercrossings, but for final price fixations we find no such trend.

Peter Bossaerts1,3,4, Antonio Rangel1,3; 1Division of Humanities & Social
Sciences, Caltech, 2Yale School of Management, 3Computational and Neural
Systems, Caltech, 4SFI, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale Lausanne — A growing body of evidence suggests that investors often make sub-optimal
financial decisions. It has been proposed that some of these mistakes
result from value computations by the brain’s decision making circuitry
that induce individuals to maximize the hedonic experience associated
with individual trades, instead of maximizing overall portfolio returns.
We tested this hypothesis by measuring neural activity with fMRI while
subjects made buying and selling decisions in an experimental stock
market. With respect to selling mistakes, we found that activity in the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum (vSt) correlated with a realization utility signal at the time of making selling decisions that measured the profit or loss associated with selling individual
stocks. The strength of the realization utility signals correlated with individuals’ propensity to make selling mistakes. With respect to buying
mistakes, we found that activity in the vSt correlated with a regret signal
at the time of price updates that measured the forgone profits from not
having purchased a successful stock. The strength of the regret signals
correlated with individuals’ propensity to make buying mistakes.

LOSS AVERSION IN RISKY CHOICE IS MODULATED BY DIFFERENTIAL
ATTENTION TO LOSSES Vanessa Janowski1, Antonio Rangel1; 1California
Institute of Technology — A large body of behavioral evidence has shown
that individuals exhibit loss aversion at the time of risky choice in the
sense that losses are weighted more heavily than gains of equal magnitude and likelihood. Based on recent research by our group, which has
shown that attention affects the computation and comparison of values
during simple choices, we hypothesized that differences in loss aversion
could be modulated by differential attention to losses. In particular, we
hypothesized that individuals who pay more relative attention to losses
would exhibit more loss aversion, and that controlling for value, random
increases in the relative amount of attention paid to losses would result
in more loss averse choices. We tested these hypotheses using a simple
eye-tracking choice task in which subjects made binary choices between
risky options and a constant sure outcome. Each lottery was comprised
of a gain and loss component, as well as percentages indicating the likelihood of receiving each, all of which varied across trials. Eye-tracking
allowed us to observe the amount of time subjects spent looking at both
gains and losses. We then estimated the parameters of a prospect theory
model for each subject, and also for pooled trials with above and below
average relative fixations to losses. Consistent with the first hypothesis,
we found that more loss averse subjects paid more relative attention to
losses. Consistent with the second hypothesis, we found that individuals
were more loss averse in trials in which they paid more relative attention
to losses.

methods. The current fMRI study investigates the neural correlates associated with the most commonly studied systems. Prior to scanning, participants learned the following three different category structures:
unstructured (US), ruled-based (RB) and information-integration (II). In
67

Poster Session B — Sunday, April 3, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse
US tasks, each stimulus is learned individually; there is no rule, verbal or
nonverbal, that facilities performance. In RB tasks, participants learn to
correctly classify the RB stimuli via an explicit reasoning process. In II
tasks, information from both stimulus dimensions is integrated at a predecisional stage. The participants saw similar stimuli for each structure,
but a colored box around the stimulus cued the three different structures, i.e., red for US, blue for RB, and green for II. Participants were
cued to switch between three different structures every 15-20 trials. Basal
ganglia (BG) activation and left hippocampal deactivation were associated with successful categorization across all category structures. Additionally, successful US categorization was associated with activation in
the parietal cortex, successful RB categorization was associated with activation in the frontal lobe, and successful II categorization was associated
with activity in both parietal cortex and frontal areas, as well as strong
activation in visual areas. Switching between the respective systems
modulated activity in the basal ganglia.

ANTICIPATION AND HEDONIC REACTION TO REWARDS VERSUS LOSSES

E. Smith1,2; 1Columbia University, 2New York State Psychiatric Institute,
3University of Colorado at Boulder, 4University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill — Converging evidence in human and animal studies has shown that
dopamine signaling underlies incremental, feedback-based learning,
which supports the brain’s ability to anticipate outcomes from associative cues. Dysfunctional signaling may result in deficits in predicting
and/or updating hedonic value of outcomes, which has been shown to
exist in patients with schizophrenia. However, the extent to which dysfunction is related to the motivational deficits associated with the negative symptom domain of schizophrenia (e.g., anhedonia, avolition,
flattened affect), and how this differs in goal-seeking versus loss-avoiding contexts, is not well understood. To address this question, we tested
patients with schizophrenia with a range of symptom pathology, and
healthy controls. On each trial, subjects made a choice, received feedback, and then received a reward. In the “reward” condition, correct
feedback was associated with monetary gain, whereas in the “loss” condition, correct feedback was associated with avoiding monetary loss.
Our findings indicate that while controls outperformed patients, the
patients performed relatively better in the loss condition than the gain
condition, as indicated by selection of optimal choices, feedback sensitivity, and model-based analyses. Further, performance in the gain condition was negatively correlated with increasing negative symptoms.
Performance in the loss condition was positively correlated with working memory. These findings suggest a relatively selective deficit in incremental learning in the context of seeking rewards, which may be related
to dysfunctional signaling in cortico-striatal dopamine pathways. FMRI
is currently being used to examine brain systems supporting choice,
anticipation, and hedonic reaction in patients with schizophrenia and
controls.

VALUE TRANSFER IN SENSORY PRECONDITIONING IN PARKINSON’S
DISEASE AND HEALTHY AGING G. Elliott Wimmer1, Karin Foerde1, Erin

stimuli
Kendall Braun1, Daphna Shohamy1; 1Columbia University — When
are related through coinciding experiences, subsequent rewards and
punishments associated with one pair member can impact preferences
for the other. This value transfer effect, as demonstrated in the sensory
preconditioning paradigm, has been known experimentally since the
early days of conditioning research. However, the neural and cognitive
mechanisms supporting sensory preconditioning remain largely
unknown. Guided by recent animal research, we hypothesized that
value transfer in this paradigm may depend on multiple cognitive processes and neural systems: the dopamine-innervated basal ganglia may
support initial value learning, while the medial temporal lobe may be
necessary for successful transfer of value. To explore the effects of aging

68

and the role of dopamine in value transfer, we tested individuals with
Parkinson’s disease, healthy older adults, and healthy younger adults. In
our sensory preconditioning paradigm, stimuli are first incidentally
paired (with no reinforcement). Then, one stimulus from each pair is
used as a predictor of reward. Finally, preferences are assessed in a test
phase. Preliminary results indicate that Parkinson’s patients were able to
learn the reward and loss associations, with better learning for rewards
than losses. Value transfer, assessed by preference for the incidentally
paired but unrewarded stimuli, was variable in all groups, with moderately higher transfer of value for reward than loss. Preliminary results
using additional measures of transfer suggest that Parkinson’s patients
show a different memory signature of value transfer than older adults,
possibly due to its dependence on the interaction of memory systems
susceptible to age- and disease-related functional impairments.

MANIPULATION OF SENSORI-MOTOR TRANSFORMATIONS IN
PERCEPTUAL DECISION MAKING Drew Erickson1, Andrew Kayser1;
1Ernest Gallo Clinic And Research Center — The

ability to link sensation and
action is integral to even the most simple and quick decisions. Previous
studies have revealed a role of parietal cortex in both sensory and motor
processing during perceptual decisions, but often these components can
be difficult to dissociate. Recently, we demonstrated that a sensory
manipulation of a decision task including relevant and irrelevant visual
stimulus features dissociates BOLD activity within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). If IPS is involved in sensori-motor transformations, then BOLD
activity in the IPS should also dissociate during a motor manipulation of
a decision task, with an increase when sensori-motor transformations are
performed. In a variation of our previous task, subjects performing a
dot-motion discrimination task responded with either button presses or
saccades after a delay. Information for response modality and/or withinmodality response mapping was given either during the presentation of
the dot-motion stimulus or during the motor response cue, allowing for
motor components to be dissociated from sensory discrimination components. Subjects’ responses were increasingly accurate with increasing
motion coherence, with no significant variation for task or modality.
Investigation of BOLD activity in IPS showed that during the stimulus
cue, activity is significantly greater when response information is given.
Furthermore, activity following the response cue is stronger when the
response information is given then instead, indicating that this increase
coincides with the point when the subject is performing sensori-motor
transformations. Examination of other regions of interest, such as FEF
and IFS, should further define the network underlying motor planning
and execution.

OUTCOMES IN REWARD-PUNISHMENT CIRCUITRY – AN FMRI STUDY

Hartford Hospital, 2Dept. of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine,

Dept. of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University — Background: Few neuroimaging studies focus on the outcome of tasks assessing reward/punishment. We hypothesized that fMRI-measured brain activity in 178
screened, healthy subjects during performance of a monetary incentive
delay (MID) task in reward and punishment outcomes would differ in
regions comprising a well-described human reward neural system.
Methods and Materials: From the above total, 95 subjects (age 24.76 ± 9.5
yrs, 65% women) had sufficient numbers of reward and 100 (age 25.26 ±
10.22yrs, 67% women) sufficient punishment trials to estimate brain activation. One-sample t-tests in SPM5 using small volume correction examined $5 reward relative to non-reward contexts, and $5 punishment
relative to non-punishment outcomes for preselected regions-of-interest
in NAcc, amygdala, insula, mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and orbitalfrontal cortex (OFC) (significance evaluated using FDR). Results: In the
Reward vs. Non-Reward outcome comparison, participants had greater
activation to reward in bilateral NAcc (q<.0.0001), right MPFC
(q<.0.005), right OFC (q<.0.009), and right amygdala (q<.0.006). Insula

activity was not significantly greater in the actual reward delivery context. Contrast of $5 Punishment vs. Non-Punishment outcome trials
found that participants had greater activity in left and right MPFC
(q<.0.001) and left and right OFC (q<.0.0001). Conclusions: Consistent
with previous reports, most of the brain’s reward system was shown to
be engaged when actual rewards were delivered, emphasizing the personal salience of receipt rather than just knowledge of winning. In contrast, actual receipt of punishment elicited greater activation only in
MPFC and OFC, suggesting these regions play a broader role in evaluating behavioral contingencies.

RESPONSE-RELATED BRAIN POTENTIALS FOLLOWING CORRECT AND
INCORRECT RESPONSES: EVIDENCE FROM TEMPORAL-SPATIAL PCA
Tanja Endrass1, Moritz Ischebeck1, Norbert Kathmann1; 1Humboldt-University
Berlin, Germany — Two event-related brain potential components have

been repeatedly reported following correct and incorrect responses, the
error-related negativity (ERN) and the correct-related negativity (CRN).
The functional significance of these components and its underlying processes are part of an ongoing debate. Recently, it was shown with independent component analysis (ICA) that the negativities following both
responses can be accounted for by the same independent component
that is corresponding to a dipolar source in the rostral cingulate zone.
However, differential effects on ERN and CRN were reported with clinical or motivational variables. Further, ICA might not be capable to dissociate two components with similar timing and topography. With the
present study we studied performance monitoring in a visual discrimination task with three difficulty levels and utilized a temporal-spatial
principal components analysis (PCA) to examine whether ERN and CRN
could be explained with one or more factors. Results indicate that the
ERN was reduced with higher task difficulty whereas the CRN did not
vary across difficulty levels. PCA revealed two spatial factors within the
time course of response-related negativities that were characterized by a
fronto-central distribution and significantly differed between correct and
incorrect responses. These data support the idea that ERN and CRN
might reflect a combination of two underlying cognitive processes that
contribute to both components.

DISTINCT REWARD-SEEKING AND LOSS-AVERSE SIGNALS DURING
DECISION-MAKING IN THE BALLOON ANALOGUE RISK TASK (BART)
Rena Fukunaga1, Joshua W. Brown1, Tim Bogg1; 1Indiana University,
Bloomington, IN — There is debate over the roles of the anterior insula

(INS) and anterior cingulate (ACC) in decision-making. The present
study focuses on distinguishing decision-making and feedback-related
processes in the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) when subjects decide
whether to pursue a gain while the probability of loss increases parametrically. We modified the BART relative to previous studies to address a
confound between decision-related and feedback-related signals by
including a longer variable delay, which allowed for independent analysis of choice vs. feedback-related brain activity. The results showed
within-subjects correlations of brain activation with the probability of
explosion during the decision-making period. When subjects chose to
discontinue inflating the balloon (win option), we observed greater bilateral INS activity at the time of decision as the probability of explosion
increased, consistent with increased loss-aversion. In contrast, we found
robust ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and medial frontal
gyrus (meFG) activity when subjects chose to continue inflating the balloon (risky option), consistent with reward-seeking. However, in the
regions of ACC, right INS, thalamus (THAL), and middle frontal gyrus

probability of explosion increased, —findings consistent with a reduced
loss-aversion signal. This is the opposite of what has been found in previous studies that did not distinguish decision-making vs. feedback signals. Our results highlight the existence of distinct reward-seeking and
loss-averse signals during decision-making, as well as the importance of

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY (FRN)
IN A SIMPLE GAMBLING TASK Jill Grose-Fifer1, Sheneeka Saul1, Ozlem

Yuksel-Sokmen1, Tina M. Zottoli1, Steven Hoover1, Katherine Navarro1; 1John
Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY — Men are generally reported to show
higher rates of risk taking than women. To investigate whether this prevalence might be related to gender differences in feedback processing, we
compared the feedback related negativity (FRN) elicited in a simple
monetary gambling task, in men and women. The FRN is thought to
reflect the arrival of a dopaminergic reward prediction error in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which serves as a rapid, relatively automatic, but coarse appraisal of the motivational impact of ongoing events.
The error signal is believed to be important in developing avoidant
behaviors that minimize risk taking. In this study, EEG was recorded
while participants chose between two colored cards that appeared on the
computer screen and then received feedback about their choice. Consistent with previous studies, the FRN was found be larger to losses than to
gains. However, males but not females, also showed a significant magnitude (large, small) x valence (win, loss) interaction. Both males and
females showed significantly larger FRNs for large losses compared to
large wins. However, only females showed a significant difference
between small wins and small losses. This suggests that while females
clearly differentiated between wins and losses of any magnitude, males
processed a small win much like a loss. Our results may help to explain
why risk taking is more prevalent in men than women, since it appears
that a small win is less rewarding for males.

THE VALUE OF VICTORY - NEURAL MECHANISMS OF THE WINNER’S
CURSE Wouter van den Bos1, Arjun Talwar1, Sam McClure1; 1Stanford
University, Department of Psychology — One of the most interesting but
unresolved phenomena in auction behavior is the winner’s curse — the
strong tendency of participants to bid more than rational agent theory
prescribes, often at a significant loss (Kagel & Levin, 2002). In order to
determine the nature of the mechanisms that underlie this bidding
behavior we set up a hyper-scanning (Montague et al., 2002) experiment
in which 5 participants were simultaneously scanned while they participated in a competitive common value auction. In total, 25 healthy adults
participated in this study from which we acquired 22 usable fMRI data
sets. In a previous behavioral study we have showed that the level of
social competition in auctions predicted the magnitude of the winner’s
curse (van den Bos et al., 2008). Furthermore, we observed that the magnitude of the curse declined over time, suggesting that bidding decisions
are made on the basis of feedback acquired during the auction. Based on
the hypothesis that bidding strategies (which depend on the expected
values of bids) are the result of feedback-based learning and social values, we develop and employ an extended reinforcement learning model
to fit behavioral and neuroimaging data. Our behavioral analyses
showed that this model is able to predict the behavior of naïve auction
participants. More importantly, fMRI analyses revealed that neural systems implicated in reinforcement learning (particularly the ventral striatum) correlate significantly with reward prediction errors from the best
fitting learning models.

schizotypal traits of healthy subjects. A recent work also showed ERP
effects of the induction of paranoid feelings in healthy subjects. The
present study was aimed at exploring the effect of a single and minimal
dose (i.e., 2.5mg) of antipsychotic (i.e., olanzapine) taken on the eve of
the testing of healthy subjects. We used the visual primed semantic-categorization task utilized in previous studies in normals and patients.
Healthy participants (N=47) were tested in a double-blind placebo-control cross-over paradigm. With the medication, ERPs were slightly less
negative in the N400 time window at fronto-central electrode sites for
both the exemplars and the non-exemplars of the category used (i.e., the
animal category). Unexpectedly, anterior slow positive waves (ASPWs)
were larger with olanzapine than with the placebo within a 700-1200 ms
post-onset time-window. ASPWs have been proposed to be related to
more in-depth, re-evaluation processes that delay the return of the ERPs
to the baseline. Further analyses of these data were made to investigate
the focus of such re-evaluation. They revealed: 1) that the amplitudes of
the ASPWs correlate with reaction times: faster subjects had greater
ASPWs than slower subjects and, 2) that the ASPW difference found
between the two conditions (placebo vs. olanzapine) does not exist in the
case no response choice had to be made in the task. These results suggest
that antipsychotics could boost re-evaluations of our choices.

the study didn’t differentiate the underlying process and how the brain
processes the information. In our experiment, the attractiveness of the
proposer was manipulated. The reaction time, EEG data and subjective
rating of participants as responders were recorded. Thirty undergraduates (15 males vs. 15 females) from National Chengchi University in Taiwan were recruited as participants. In subjective rating, it revealed that
subjects rated the attractive proposers more attractive than non-attractive proposers. In behavior data, 2(attractiveness) X2(gender) X3(offer)
ANOVA showed the reaction times under offer 10 and offer 30 were
both longer than offer 50. Furthermore, the acceptance rate at offer 10
was lower than offer 30 and offer 50, also the acceptance rate of offer 30
was lower than offer 50. The other effects remained non-significant. In
EEG data, a 2(attractiveness) X2(gender) X3(offer) x3(position) ANOVA
was performed. A two-way interaction of attractiveness and gender and
a three-way interaction of attractiveness, offer and position were
observed in FRN (feedback-related negativity). It showed the non-attractive proposers elicited larger FRN than attractive proposers in female
participants, but no difference was found in male participants. Furthermore, FRN was larger in frontal (FZ) when participants faced non-attractive proposers than attractive proposers under offer 30, but no difference
was found under offer 10 and offer 50. With the findings of FRN, it
revealed the attractiveness only had an influence under conflict situation
in the ultimatum game.

Department of Psychology, New York University, New York, NY 10003, 2Center

reinforcement learning (RL) theories propose that “prediction error” signals in the brain’s nigrostriatal system guide learning for trial-and-error
decision-making. However, since different decision variables can be
learned from quantitatively similar error signals, a critical question is
what is the content of decision representations trained by the error signals. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor
neural activity in a two-arm-bandit counterfactual decision task that provided human subjects with information about foregone as well as

70

obtained monetary outcomes so as to dissociate teaching signals that
update expected values for each action, vs. signals that train relative
preferences between actions (a “policy”). The reward probabilities of
both choices varied independently from each other. This specific design
allowed us to test whether subjects’ choice behavior was guided by policy-based methods which directly map states to advantageous actions, or
value-based methods such as Q-learning where choice policies are
instead generated by learning an intermediate representation (reward
expectancy). Behaviorally, we found participants’ choices were significantly influenced by obtained as well as forgone rewards from the previous trial. We also found human subjects’ blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) responses in striatum were modulated in opposite directions by
the experienced and foregone rewards but not by reward expectancy.
This neural pattern, as well as subjects’ choice behavior, is consistent
with a teaching signal for developing “habits” or relative action preferences, rather than prediction errors for updating separate action values.

THE NEURAL CODING OF PREDICTION ERRORS: DISSOCIATIONS
BETWEEN ACTIVE AND OBSERVATIONAL REWARD-BASED LEARNING

Christian Bellebaum1, Daniel Jokisch2, Elke Gizewski2, Michael Forsting2, Irene
Daum1; 1Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, 2University Hospital Essen,
Germany — Associations between stimuli and financial outcomes can be

learned actively or by observation. Recent electrophysiological evidence
suggests that the neural mechanisms of feedback coding differ depending on the active involvement of the subject. The present study examined
potential differences in prediction error coding in active and observational learning from feedback using functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). Two groups of fifteen subjects each, one learning
actively and one by observation, participated in the study. On each trial,
active learners chose between two abstract visual stimuli, followed by a
probabilistic monetary outcome stimulus (50 C win, 0 C or 50 C loss).
Each observational learner watched the choices and accompanying outcomes of one active learner. Subjects in both groups learned to predict
the outcomes associated with particular stimuli. In active learners, positive and negative prediction errors were coded in the right basal ganglia
(Putamen and Caudate Nucleus) and amygdala, respectively, while in
observational learners the right hippocampus and the left insula were
involved. As revealed by direct comparisons between groups, the right
caudate nucleus was activated more strongly in active learners compared to observational learners, whereas the reverse pattern was found
for the right hippocampus. These findings show that the neural coding
of outcome prediction errors depends on the relevance of the feedback
for the learning subject’s behavior. The BG appear to link actively performed behavioral responses and the accompanying outcomes. Differential recruitment of the caudate and the hippocampus in active and
observational learning may further indicate differences in learning strategies.

subset of patients with Parkinson’s disease who are treated with dopamine agonist therapy develop impulse control disorders (ICDs) such as
pathological gambling and compulsive eating (Nirenberg and Waters,

are prone to ICDs may have a variant of Parkinson’s disease characterized by a disproportionate impairment of mesocorticolimbic versus
nigrostriatal dopaminergic function (Rabinak, 2010). Since the mesolimbic pathway provides direct input to the hippocampus, we hypothesize
that Parkinson’s disease subjects with ICDs might be impaired at hip-

pocampal-dependent learning, as compared with Parkinson’s disease
subjects without ICDs. We tested subjects with Parkinson’s disease on
dopamine agonist therapy with and without ICDs. Subjects were tested
using a computer-based acquired equivalence task, in which they first
use feedback-based learning to acquire information, and must subsequently generalize this information to novel contexts without the aid of
feedback. This task has previously been used to show that subjects with
Parkinson’s disease have impairment at the striatal-dependent acquisition phase, and subjects with hippocampal atrophy have impairment at
the hippocampal-dependent generalization phase (Myers, et al., 2003).
We show that, although subjects with Parkinson’s disease with and
without ICDs perform similarly at acquisition, those with ICDs are
impaired at generalization. Thus, Parkinson’s disease subjects with ICDs
perform more like subjects with hippocampal atrophy than like non-ICD
Parkinson’s disease subjects, providing further evidence for a mesocorticolimbic subtype of Parkinson’s disease and highlighting the potential
role of hippocampal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ICDs.

THE RECOGNITION HEURISTIC STUDIED BY EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS
(ERPS) Timm Rosburg1, Axel Mecklinger1, Christian Frings1; 1Saarland
University — The recognition heuristic describes a simple decision rule,
saying that, when two objects have to be ranked with regard to a criterion and only one of the objects is recognized, the recognized object is
ranked higher. Here, we investigated this heuristic in a city size comparison task by means of ERPs. Participants had to decide which of two cities has more inhabitants. To enforce the usage of the heuristic, only pairs
of well-known and relatively unknown city names were presented. Data
analysis revealed that participants chose the well-known city name in
90.5 % of the trials, resulting in 79.3 % correct decisions. ERPs to wellknown city names were characterized by a larger positivity at early
latencies (300-450 ms and 450-600 ms), as compared to unknown city
names, while at later latencies (1000-1500 ms) unknown city names elicited more positive ERPs. We tried to predict the participants’ decision on
the basis of single trial EEG data in a binary logistic regression analysis.
Just taking into account the fronto-central EEG data of the earliest time
window (the putative correlate of familiarity related memory processes),
we could predict 55.8 % of the decisions. EEG data of this time window
remained a significant predictor, even when EEG data of later time windows were added to the regression model. Findings indicate that familiarity assessment, i.e. a form of context-free recognition, contributes to
decisions made on the basis of the recognition heuristic.

THE MAGNITUDE EFFECT IN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE RESULTS FROM
INCREASED SELF-CONTROL Bokyung Kim1, Anthony Liatsis1, Ian Ballard1,

Samuel McClure1; 1Stanford University — People value options less as a
monotonic function of their delay until delivery and choose immediate
rewards over larger, delayed rewards due to this tendency. Previous
work on intertemporal choices has shown that discount rates decrease
dramatically as the value of individual options is increased, a phenomenon known as the magnitude effect. The dominant explanation for this
finding depends on curvature of utility functions as at larger magnitudes. We report that this explanation is insufficient. In three experiments we demonstrate that the magnitude effect remains under the mere
impression of larger magnitudes as created by changing the denomination of monetary offers. For example, Koreans in America and Americans in Korea are significantly more patient for Korean Won than US
Dollars (approx. 1100:1 conversion rate). We hypothesized that the magnitude effect results from enhanced self-control, rather than systematic
differences between subjective values. We find support for this hypothesis in a functional MRI experiment with 15subjects instructed to choose
between smaller/immediate rewards and larger/delayed rewards. We
analyze brain activity in two conditions – high and low magnitude. We
find that higher magnitude recruits more activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. Previous studies have shown
that these areas are involved in executive functions including self-conCognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

trol. Additionally, there was no difference in dopamine-related regions
across conditions. This study has confirmed that deciding in favor of
long-term outcomes, especially for higher stakes, depends on the exertion of cognitive control and this effect can be evoked by the mere
reframing of outcomes.

RELIABILITY OF REWARD-RELATED NEURAL SIGNALS: DO YOU GET
WHAT YOU PAY FOR? Charlene C. Wu1, Andrew J. Trujillo1, Gregory

Samanez-Larkin1,2, Brian Knutson1; 1Stanford University, 2Vanderbilt
University — Early studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging

(FMRI) to examine reward processing in humans identified increased
blood oxygenated level-dependent activation in the nucleus accumbens
(NAcc) during reward anticipation and in the mesial prefrontal cortex
(MPFC) in response to reward outcomes (Knutson et al., 2001). These
reward-related neural responses have recently been linked to individual
differences in impulsivity (Beaver et al, 2006) and psychopathy (Buckholtz et al., 2010). However, the test-retest reliability of reward-related
activation has been questioned (Fliessbach et al., 2010), implicitly raising
concerns about the robustness of links to individual differences. In this
study, participants (n=6) completed two FMRI sessions of a monetary
incentive delay (MID) task separated by 2 years. During the MID task,
participants anticipated and experienced the outcomes of six cue types
signaling varying amounts of potential monetary gains and losses (±0.00,
±$0.50, ±$5.00). To examine test-retest reliability of activation, peak individual responses were extracted from both NAcc and MPFC volumes of
interest across the two sessions. Test-retest reliabilities during reward
anticipation in the NAcc and in response to reward outcomes in the
MPFC demonstrated significant test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients of ~0.6) for the highest level of gain (+$5.00) but not for
the lowest level of gain (+$0.00). Loss trials did not induce reliable activation. These preliminary findings suggest that reward paradigms that
use a range of incentives may better establish test-retest reliability of
reward-related neural activation, thus strengthening the support for
using FMRI to index individual characteristics with potential relevance
to decision making.

LATERALIZED READINESS POTENTIAL REFLECTS A DYNAMIC
REPRESENTATION OF REWARD IN A SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING
TASK Sharareh Noorbaloochi1, Dahlia Sharon1, James L. McClelland1;
1Stanford University — In

perceptual decision making tasks, prior knowledge about choice payoffs biases decisions toward the higher paying
alternative. However, little is known about how payoff information
affects the neural circuits underlying these biased choices in human subjects. In this study, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals
from 13 participants while they performed a deadlined two-alternative
forced-choice task. The participants had to determine whether a rectangle was longer to the left or right of center and squeezed a dynamometer
with their left or right hand to respond. On each trial, payoff information
was disclosed 1.5 sec prior to stimulus onset. Two stimulus difficulty
levels were employed, and the payoff was either balanced (equal reward
for both alternatives) or unbalanced (one choice worth twice as much as
the other). All conditions were randomly interleaved. Behaviorally, with
unbalanced rewards, fast responses were associated with high reward
bias; bias was reduced for slower responses. Neurally, reward bias was
observed in the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), a response-related
negative-going potential contralateral to the responding hand, in two
ways: (1) a shift in the baseline activity toward the higher reward alternative prior to stimulus onset, (2) an abrupt rise in activity toward the
higher reward alternative 150-200 ms after stimulus presentation, before
stimulus information started to affect the LRP. These results suggest that
payoff information is reflected in preparatory activity in movement
planning structures before sensory information is available. Furthermore, this biased preparatory activity increases quickly once movement
is allowed but before stimulus information is integrated.

WITH AGE COMES WISDOM: DECISION-MAKING IN YOUNGER AND
OLDER ADULTS Darrell Worthy1, Marissa Gorlick2, W. Todd Maddox2;
1Texas A&M University, 2University of Texas at Austin — Frontal

brain regions
are implicated in model-based and striatal brain regions are implicated
in model-free reinforcement-learning (Glascher et al., 2010). The modelbased system develops and tests specific hypotheses regarding the task
reward structure to guide decision-making. In contrast, the model-free
system uses reward prediction errors to guide behavior. Older adults are
thought to use “frontal compensation” mechanisms to offset age-based
neural declines (Park & Reuter-Lorentz, 2009). We propose and test the
hypothesis that older adults rely more on the model-based system, and
younger adults on the model-free system. We present behavioral data
from two choice-dependent tasks where the rewards available were
dependent on previous choices. Because optimal performance requires
uncovering the choice-dependent nature of the reward structures used,
older adults should perform better than younger adults if they are relying more on the model-based system. In both versions, the decreasing
option is short-run optimal, but the more that the decreasing option is
selected the smaller are the rewards associated with both options. In the
Increasing-Optimal version, the long-run optimal strategy is to repeatedly select the increasing option. In the Decreasing-Optimal version, the
long-run optimal strategy is to repeatedly select the decreasing option.
Younger adults (aged 18-24) performed similarly on both tasks, showing
relative insensitivity to the difference in optimal strategy. However,
older adults (aged 61-86) were highly sensitive to the nature of the optimal strategy and earned more points than younger adults on both tasks.
This suggests that older adults may be better at flexibly responding to
the reward environment.

making in multiple sclerosis (MS) so far only used the Iowa Gambling
Task (IGT) and included only patients with relapsing-remitting MS subtype. When MS-patients were reported impaired in the IGT, their deficits
were unrelated to other neuropsychological dysfunctions. Here we used
the Game of Dice Task (GDT), sensitive to aspects of decision making
that rely on executive functions, in a mixed sample of relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) MS-patients. Methods: Unlike
the IGT, the GDT assesses decision making by displaying decision rules
and probabilities explicitly and therefore focuses on decision making
aspects that rely more on executive than emotional functions. RR, SP MSpatients and demographically-matched healthy controls were studied.
Only patients with MRI-confirmed diagnosis of MS were included. The
GDT, a standard neuropsychological battery, questionnaires on mood,
fatigue and disability were administered to all participants. Results:
GDT netscores (risky minus safe decisions) were lower in patients than
controls, with more pronounced deficits in SP MS. Patients’ ability to
benefit from feedback in the GDT was also impaired. Patients’ Expanded
Disability Status Scale scores (a clinical index for MS disease-severity)
were negatively correlated with GDT performance. In patients, GDT performance was related to neuropsychological indicators of frontal lobe
dysfunction. While mood was uncorrelated with GDT performance,
fatigue did influence GDT but did not eliminate the correlations with
frontal lobe functions. Conclusion: The GDT revealed decision making

impairments in MS patients that rely on executive functions and covary

Jennifer Whitman1,2, Woodward Todd1,2; 1University of British Columbia,
Vancouver, Canada, 2BC Mental Health and Addictions Research Institute,
Vancouver, Canada — In the current study, we investigated neural regions

associated with the processing of integrating disconfirmatory evidence
using event-related magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 20 healthy participants completed a perceptual interpretation task, in which they rated
the degree to which a morphed image composed of two different animals (e.g., 40% koala, 60% cougar) appeared to be an image of one animal or the other. Following a delay, participants were either presented
with the same image (confirmatory evidence condition) or a second
image of the animals morphed at a different ratio (e.g., 60% koala, 40%
cougar; disconfirmatory evidence condition), and were asked to re-rate
the images. Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRICPCA) revealed five components, one of which was specifically responsive to integration of disconfirmatory evidence, and another specifically
responsive to confirmatory evidence. While both networks involved activation in visual and right lateral prefrontal cortex, that responsive to disconfirmatory evidence additionally involved activation in the dorsal
anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and deactivation in the default network. These results suggest that the dACC, which has been implicated in
the detection of conditions that require adjustments in the current cognitive state, is activated during the processing of disconfirmatory but not
confirmatory evidence.

EFFECTS OF AMBIGUOUS FEEDBACK ON LEARNING AND FEEDBACKRELATED BRAIN ACTIVITY Benjamin Ernst1, Marco Steinhauser1;
1University of Konstanz — Feedback

processing is crucial for adaptive decision-making. However, feedback can be ambiguous and different
sources of feedback can provide contradicting information. In this case,
it is necessary to select relevant, valid feedback while suppressing the
processing of irrelevant, potentially invalid feedback. The present study
used event-related potentials to investigate how learning in a simple
choice task is influenced by automatic processing of irrelevant feedback.
During a learning phase, participants had to guess which one of two
stimuli was associated with reward, and feedback had to be processed to
learn the correct response. Feedback was a Stroop color-word compound
consisting of an irrelevant word providing potentially invalid feedback
and a relevant but delayed presented color providing valid feedback.
Performance in a subsequent test phase indicated that learning was
impaired when relevant and irrelevant feedback dimensions were
incompatible. The analysis of feedback-locked brain activity revealed
that this effect did not reflect automatic learning from invalid feedback
but rather impaired processing of relevant feedback due to interference
from irrelevant feedback. Irrelevant feedback was not associated with
feedback-related brain activity but led to a reduced feedback-locked
P300 for relevant feedback when relevant and irrelevant feedback
dimensions were incompatible. These results demonstrate that learning
from feedback in decision making is strongly affected by automatically
processed, irrelevant feedback.

quently changed. It has been previously suggested that cognitive control
is recruited to facilitate adaptation to volatile and uncertain environments (Bland & Schaefer, under review). In order to further examine this
possibility, we used a decision-making task with high SRO volatility in
which each decision trial was preceded by a task depleting cognitive
resources. 25 participants took part in a decision making task interleaved
with an Erikson Flanker task using a 2 [Volatility (Volatile vs. Stable)] x 2
[conflict (congruent vs. incongruent)] design. Behavioural results
revealed that the behavioural effects of volatility were increased when
decision-making was preceded by an incongruent flanker trial. EEG/
ERP results showed a significant interaction of volatility and congruency
in an N1 component, driven by a larger volatility-related N1 after incongruent compared to congruent flankers. Consistent with prior ERP
research on cognitive effort, the Volatility X Congruency interaction may
reflect greater volatility-related demands on cognitive control systems
when cognitive resources are depleted. These findings highlight the
importance of the role of cognitive control and attentional processes for
successful adaptation to volatile and uncertain contexts.

PROBLEM GAMBLERS EXHIBIT ATYPICAL REWARD PROCESSING IN
FRONTAL CORTEX FOLLOWING FEEDBACK DURING GAMBLING Scott

A. K. Oberg1, Gregory J. Christie1,2, Andrew Butcher1, Matthew S. Tata1;
1University of Lethbridge, 2Simon Fraser University — Problem or Pathological Gambling (PG) is a serious mental health disorder that affects
approximately 2% of the North American population. It is increasingly
conceptualized as an addiction, rather than an impulse control disorder,
however the mechanism of addiction remains unclear. Unlike substance
abuse, gambling behaviour is driven by sensory feedback – wins and
losses – during a cognitive task. In gambling, the addictive stimulus
crosses the blood-brain barrier via the retinae and basilar membrane.
Previous research in healthy participants has shown that feedback during gambling tasks triggers stereotypical neural responses evident in the
electroencephalogram (EEG) and in the Event-Related Potential (ERP).
These include the Feedback-Related Mediofrontal Negativity (FRN), the
feedback-related P300, and an increase in induced theta-band (4 - 7 Hz)
power. We tested the theory that abnormal feedback processing characterizes brain activity in problem gamblers while gambling. EEG was
recorded from non-gamblers and self-identified gamblers while they
engaged in a computer version of the Iowa Gambling Task. Feedback
following high-risk/high-reward bets triggered the FRN in both gamblers and controls, however in gamblers the FRN was preceded by a
larger fronto-central difference not found in non-gamblers. We localized
this early FRN in gamblers to medial frontal cortex using distributed
source imaging (LORETA). We also found that feedback-induced theta
power commonly found in such tasks was absent in gamblers. We conclude that EEG and ERP techniques reveal neurophysiological differences between gamblers and non-gamblers and suggest that this may
lead to insights into the broader problem of reward processing in addictive behaviours.

was found at frontal leads (LFN) across all task conditions. For low monetary reward trials, a less negative LFN was associated with higher selfreported anhedonia among all participants, and increased nicotine
dependence among smokers (p’s <.05). Smokers had a smaller LFN relative to non-smokers on low-monetary-gain trials that remained robust
after controlling for self-reported anhedonia (p <.05). Findings from the
present study identify the P300 and LFN as neurophysiological correlates of reward processing that differ across smokers and non-smokers,
where the P300 is broadly associated with nicotine dependence, and the
LFN is sensitive to differences between smoking groups and selfreported anhedonia. A reduced neural response to reward is associated
with smoking dependence and pleasure capacity.

THE VALUE OF EXPERIENCE: A DOUBLE ECHO FMRI STUDY OF THE
MODULATION OF VALUE JUDGEMENT BY RECENT EXPERIENCE Timothy
Mullett1, Richard J. Tunney1; 1University of Nottingham — New

models of
decision making emphasize the effect of recent experience upon value
judgements. Mounting behavioural evidence supports this assumption,
yet there have been few studies employing imaging techniques to identify underlying neural representations of these effects. We report an
fMRI study investigating the neural response to objectively identical
monetary rewards when presented in blocks with either comparatively
higher or lower average reward value. Results show that BOLD response
for the critical overlap value was not modulated by recent experiences.
However, initial analyses suggest an activation in the Posterior Cingulate Cortex where BOLD response is higher during high value blocks.
This activation is not modulated by the absolute values of individual
stimuli on a trial by trial basis, which suggests a representation of long
term average value which changes with the environment.

SINGLE UNIT AND LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS RECORD IN HUMAN
VENTRAL STRIATUM DURING A REWARD TASK Bradley Lega1, Kareem

Zaghloul2, Gordon Baltuch1, Michael Kahana3; 1University of Pennsylvania,
Department of Neurosurgery, 2National Institutes of Health, Department of
Neurosurgery, 3University of Pennsylvania, Department of Psychology — Substantial evidence obtained from animal studies suggests that the ventral
striatum plays a central role in reward processing. More recently, deep
brain stimulation (DBS) surgery has enabled researchers to extend neurophysiological recording during reward experiments to human subjects. We present data recorded from human ventral striatum during
DBS surgery for the treatment of medically refractory major depression
as a participant played a video game coupled to visual reward images.
We describe the first evidence of reward-sensitive single unit activity in
the human literature, and we present novel findings of oscillations that
are responsive to different types of feedback. Local field potential data
identify a prominent alpha oscillation sensitive to positive rather than
negative feedback, and a beta oscillation that exhibits significantly
higher during reward-neutral trials as compared to positive or negative
feedback. Our findings have implications for establishing the relationship between animal and human data and for future generations of DBS
stimulation technology targeted to the ventral striatum.

uncertain environments poses a conflict between the goals of exploiting
past knowledge in order to maximize rewards and exploring less-known

frontopolar cortex activity reflects the decision-maker’s level of internal
conflict (or uncertainty) about the state of the decision environment, and
further, it is active when decision-makers forego valuable options in

order to make exploratory decisions. We reasoned that if deciding to
explore versus exploit requires arbitrating conflicting beliefs about the
currently optimal action, we should find increased autonomic arousal
just prior to making exploratory choices. Using a simple repeated-choice
task that affords unambiguous classification of participants’ choices as
exploitative or exploratory, we find larger skin conductance responses
(SCRs) prior to making exploratory choices compared with exploitative
choices, suggesting that the conflicting demands of exploration and
exploitation are indexed by autonomic arousal. We also find elevated
SCRs in response to “prediction errors” upon presentation of outcomes
that violate previously learned payoff expectancies. Further, we specify
an ideal observer model that performs incremental belief updates with
respect to the currently optimal action. By elucidating hidden decision
variables, we are able to evaluate the hypothesis that anticipatory SCRs
index the decision-maker’s degree of belief that the to-be-explored
option is superior—thus, engaging higher-level control mechanisms—
rather than merely indexing anticipation of cognitive or monetary costs
as suggested by previous work investigating involvement of the autonomic system in decision-making.

THE VMPFC VALUE SIGNALS ARE COMPUTED BY INTEGRATING VISUAL
AND SEMANTIC INPUTS FROM FUSIFORM GYRUS AND THE PSTG
Seung-Lark Lim1, John O'Doherty1, Antonio Rangel1; 1California Institute of
Technology — Dozens of fMRI and electrophysiology studies have shown

that the vmPFC encodes stimulus value signals at the time of decision to
guide choices. But very little is known about how those value signals are
actually computed. We hypothesized that the stimulus values are computed by first assigning separate values to the stimulus attributes, and
then integrating them into a common value signal. We tested this
hypothesis using a semantic learning paradigm with novel Korean
words and a subsequent fMRI choice task in which subjects made decisions about T-shirts depicting the Korean word in different colors and
fonts. Participants who had no prior knowledge of Korean completed
initial visual and semantic liking-ratings (day 1) and Korean learning
sessions (day 2-3). In the fMRI experiment (day 4), participants rated
their likings for Korean word art T-shirts. We found that activity in the
fusiform gyrus (FG) correlated with the visual ratings of the stimuli, but
not with the semantic ratings, while the opposite was true for activity in
the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). Consistent with previous studies, overall stimulus values were represented in vmPFC. Consistent with our hypothesis, the vmPFC showed stronger functional
connectivity at the time of choice with the pSTG for the T-shirt stimuli
containing words for which they new the meaning. Our findings suggest
that the vmPFC computes stimulus values at the time of decision by integrating attribute values computed elsewhere in the cortex.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF NONSYMBOLIC AND SYMBOLIC NUMBER
PROCESSING IN CHILDREN Lisa Sprute1, Margaret Gullick1, Elise

Temple1; 1Dartmouth College — Previous studies using the neural distance
effect (increased brain activity when differentiating numbers closer
together) have indicated that number representations rely on a parietofrontal network. However, there have been no investigations of simple
symbolic (digit) and nonsymbolic (dot) representation across development from childhood to adulthood. In a pilot event-related fMRI design,
17 children (ages 5 to 17) and adults compared pairs of dot arrays or digits (one through nine). Accuracy, reaction time and BOLD signal were
measured for close (1-3) and far (5-7) comparisons. Distance was associated with extensive parietofrontal activation in both children and adults,
collapsed across format. In the nonsymbolic condition, the neural distance effect was associated with increased parietofrontal activation for
both children and adults, although children showed greater frontal activation, consistent with previous developmental research. Compara-

tively, in the symbolic condition, there was less activity for distance
overall, and adults showed more parietal activation than children. These
findings of number processing differences related to format have not
been reported in the developmental literature previously.

AN EARLY ERP MARKER FOR ARITHMETIC ABILITIES IN 7-YEAR-OLD
CHILDREN Linda P.M. Essers1, Lisa Jonkman1, Erik van Loosbroek1;
1

Maastricht University — Behavioral studies indicate that number representations possibly relate to differences in arithmetical skill. Numbers
are represented as if they form a ‘mental number line’. Numbers close to
one another share more representational overlap than numbers far apart,
resulting in greater cognitive demands and prolonged reaction times.
This representational effect is known as the distance effect (DE) but the
neurophysiological basis for the relation between DE and arithmetical
abilities is unknown. In the present study, 7-year-old children performed
serial symbolic (Arabic digits) and non-symbolic (dots) comparisons for
quantities smaller than 10 while concurrently EEG was recorded. Children’s addition and subtraction abilities were assessed using a standardized mental arithmetic test. Behaviorally both symbolic and nonsymbolic comparisons showed no relation with mental arithmetic but
EEG data did. Whereas normally DE arises around 170 ms at parietal
sites, our results showed a DE-effect earlier in time (around 123 ms) and
at more occipital sites. It had a higher amplitude for close distances and
coincided with the first positive ERP component, P1, a component considered to be reflecting early sensory processing. More importantly, only
the symbolic DE of this component was negatively associated with arithmetical abilities in general and with subtraction specifically. The association with subtraction may be due to higher computational demands that
rely on number representations in subtraction than addition. Although
P1 modulation as an orienting effect is known from the visuospatial
domain, a more definite interpretation of the DE effect for P1 awaits further investigation.

LONGITUDINAL PREDICTORS OF MATHEMATICAL REASONING DURING
DEVELOPMENT Chloe T Green1, Kirstie J Whitaker1, Joel S Steele2, Ferrer

Emilio2, Bunge A Silvia1; 1University of California, Berkeley, 2University of
California, Davis — The development of fluid reasoning (FR) is critical for

academic achievement, and is thought to rely on specific cognitive processes such as working memory (WM) and processing speed (PS). As
part of our longitudinal study on the development of fluid reasoning, we
aimed to investigate how specific cognitive factors, namely, PS, Spatial
WM (SWM), and FR measured at one timepoint differentially predict
later mathematical reasoning (as measured by WJ Number Series test) at
a second timepoint. We collected behavioral data from 201 participants
ages 6-18 (M=10.3, SD=3.2) on a wide battery of cognitive assessments.
Participants returned for a second wave of data collection approximately
1.5 years later (n=75). Results from our longitudinal analysis reveal that
FR at time 1, measured by WASI Matrices, was the strongest predictor of
math reasoning 1.5 years later (p=.0001). Spatial Working Memory
(SWM) at time 1, measured by a computerized cognitive testing battery
(CANTAB), was also a significant predictor of later math reasoning
scores (p=.005). By contrast, PS at time 1 did not significantly predict
math reasoning scores (p=.52). Findings support the theory that FR
paves the way for the development of quantitative abilities by serving as
a scaffold that allows a child to acquire other cognitive abilities, including numerical relations (Cattell, 1984). WM supports the emergence of
math reasoning, as it enables individuals to maintain and manipulate
goal-relevant information (Engle et al., 1999b).

in which it is necessary to abstract the semantic relationship between the
first two items to identify the correct response. To examine within-person changes in this form of reasoning over childhood and adolescence,
we developed a propositional analogy task involving pictures of common objects. 1st-order problems identified objects that were semantically
related to a cued object. 2nd-order problems followed the A:B::C:? format, with four answer choices: the correct response, a semantic lure
(semantically related to item C, but did not fit the 2nd-order relationship), a perceptual lure, and an unrelated lure. 109 participants (age 6-19,
M= 11.2) performed this task; 22 have returned for a second testing session, ~18 months later. Performance improved quadratically with age
(p<.001), with a large improvement on semantic lure problems from age
6-10. We conducted a mixed effects linear regression with the fixed
effects of age, matrix reasoning and vocabulary predicting accuracy, and
allowing a random intercept for the subjects with repeated measures.
1st-order problem accuracy was predicted by matrix reasoning score
over and above the quadratic effects of age (p<0.005), but was not significantly predicted by vocabulary. 2nd-order problem accuracy was predicted by both matrix reasoning (p<0.005) and vocabulary scores
(p=0.01), after correcting for age. Our data demonstrate not only the
depth of semantic knowledge required for analogical reasoning but also
the power of abstract reasoning in solving analogical problems.

NEURAL MECHANISMS OF LOSS AVERSION ACROSS DEVELOPMENT

Emily Barkley-Levenson1, Linda van Leijenhorst1, Adriana Galván1; 1UCLA —
Adolescence is a time of increased risk-taking; understanding the cause
of this behavioral change across development is critical to the goal of
preventing negative consequences of risky behavior. People differ in
their willingness to take risk, and these individual differences are driven
by differences in the combination of cognitive and affective processes.
These processes engage separable neural mechanisms, which have been
shown to mature at different rates. Differences in the function of these
mechanisms lead to measurable individual differences in loss aversion,
the tendency to avoid losses rather than seeking gains. To date developmental research has focused on the role of reward sensitivity in adolescent risk-taking, while the influence of losses and loss aversion on risky
decision-making in adolescents remains poorly understood. Our goal
was to investigate the neurodevelopmental trajectory of loss aversion,
and explore how sensitivity to gains and losses drives risk-taking behavior across development. In this study, adolescent participants completed
a modified version of a loss aversion task, in which they accepted or
rejected mixed gambles with various gain and loss amounts while fMRI
data were collected. Preliminary analyses of task performance showed
no behavioral changes across age. A preliminary analysis of the imaging
data revealed age-related changes in brain regions that show greater
activation increases with increasing gain amounts and greater deactivation with increasing loss amounts, including the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex and ventral striatum. These findings shed light on the developmental changes in loss aversion that may contribute to differences in
risk-taking behavior during adolescence.

Southern California, 3Brown University, 4University of Texas, Austin, 5University

dopamine levels in brain regions involved in reward processing and
research with humans shows that stress increases the attractiveness of
addictive drugs. The current study tested the hypothesis that stress
increases reward salience, leading to more effective learning about positive than negative outcomes in a probabilistic selection task. Given welldocumented changes to dopamine pathways with age, this study also
examined whether effects of stress on reinforcement learning differed for
younger (age 18-34) and older participants (age 65-85). Cold pressor
stress was administered to half of the participants in each age group and

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

salivary cortisol levels were used to confirm biophysiological response
to cold stress. Following the manipulation, participants completed a
probabilistic learning task involving positive and negative feedback.
Stress enhanced positive feedback learning, with similar effects in
younger and older adults. In addition, higher cortisol levels were associated with poorer negative feedback learning across age groups. These
results suggest that recent stress increases the salience of rewards relative to negative consequences and exert a similar effect on reinforcement
learning in early and late adulthood. These findings underscore the
importance of considering stress-related influences on learning.

DEVELOPMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXACT AND APPROXIMATE
SUBTRACTION Liane Moneta1, Bruce McCandliss1; 1Vanderbilt
University — Exact and approximate numerical processing engage different brain networks in adults, with exact number processing showing
increased recruitment of the angular gyrus and approximate number
processing showing increased recruitment of the intraparietal sulcus. To
examine the development of these systems we created a non-symbolic
subtraction paradigm to directly contrast these two systems in early elementary school children (grades K-3). Children viewed videos of a
woman removing a small set of discs (1-7) from a bucket and selected
which of three disc pictures (1, 2 or 3) showed how many discs remained
in the bucket. By varying the exposure time of the numerosities, this paradigm isolates exact vs. approximate arithmetic processing. In the exact
subtraction version, children had ample time to identify both operands
in the subtraction problems. In the approximate version children viewed
the operands for 125ms. Performance degraded systematically with set
size, yet in different ways across the duration manipulation. For approximate subtraction, all grades showed the same effect of set size and similar error patterns. In contrast, exact subtraction set size effects changed
dramatically across grade levels, with strongest effects occurring in kindergarten age children. Additionally, exact subtraction error distribution
(ratio of one-away errors to two-away errors) showed a sharpening of
acceptable responses with grade level, potentially reflecting progressive
sharpening of ‘number neuron’ tuning curves. This paradigm provides
cognitive metrics separating exact and approximate processes critical to
studying development of these brain systems in fMRI.

WHITE MATTER STRUCTURE UNDERLYING INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN
CHILDREN’S MATH AND READING ABILITIES Arnaud Viarouge1, Suzanne

Avery1, Bruce McCandliss1; 1Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN — Microstructural properties of distinct white matter tracts correlate with individual differences in academic performance in both typically and
atypically developing children. For example, multiple studies demonstrate a consistent association between fractional anisotropy (FA) in the
left Superior Corona Radiata (lSCR) and children’s reading scores that
are distinct from other cognitive abilities such as short term memory
(Niogi & McCandliss, 2006). However, recent investigations linking
mathematical abilities to FA in the lSCR (Van Eimeren et al., 2009, 2010)
raise new questions regarding cognitive specificity. To examine this
issue, 3T HARDI DTI scans were collected on 28 typically developing
children (ages 6 to 16) along with standardized behavioural measures of
math and reading skills, and non-verbal IQ. LSCR regions of interest
(ROIs) were individually selected using the Reproducible Objective
Quantification Scheme (ROQS). Results replicated previous findings
associating standardized reading scores with FA in this region, which
remained significant after controlling for age and IQ. In contrast,
although scores of mathematical abilities were only marginally associated with FA in this region, multiple regression analyses demonstrated
that math skills accounted for unique variance in FA after controlling for
reading, suggesting that this region plays a role in both reading and
math development.

COGNITIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NONSYMBOLIC ENUMERATION
AND SYMBOLIC MATH FLUENCY Gillian Starkey1, Bruce McCandliss1;

1Vanderbilt University — Functional neuroimaging studies of symbolic
arithmetic skill development indicate a developmental shift from frontal
to parietal activity with increasing math fluency (Rivera et al., 2005), yet
such developments are critically dependent on earlier cognitive developments in exact enumeration skills (Barth et al., 2005). The present study
investigates two forms of cognitive development supporting fluency in
nonsymbolic exact enumeration: the ability to sequentially enumerate
random arrays, versus the ability to more rapidly enumerate arrays
arranged in subgroups such that early arithmetic insights can facilitate
enumeration. Although previous fMRI studies in adults suggest both
abilities are subsumed by the same cortical systems (Piazza et al., 2002),
these abilities are likely dissociated in cognitive development of number
skills. In the present study, children in kindergarten through third grade
were asked to enumerate random and grouped arrays of dots while
naming latencies were recorded. Enumeration was facilitated for
grouped relative to random arrays, as evidenced by discrepancies
between enumeration latencies for the two types of stimuli. Furthermore, this facilitation increased with age, and correlated with children’s
fluency scores in symbolic arithmetic. This paradigm lays the basis of
novel developmental neuroimaging research to explore the neural correlates of nonsymbolic exact enumeration in children.

WHITE MATTER INTEGRITY PREDICTS FLUID REASONING ABILITY

Kirstie J. Whitaker2, Chloe T. Green2, Silvia A. Bunge2,3, Emilio Ferrer1;
1Department of Psychology, UC Davis, 2Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, UC
Berkeley, 3Department of Psychology, UC Berkeley — In this study we investigated the extent to which white matter integrity relates to the associations between fluid reasoning and processing speed in children and
adolescents aged 6-19. Diffusion tensor imaging and behavioral data
were collected from 85 participants (49 males, 36 females; Mean age =
11.79, SD = 3.73). Whole-brain white matter integrity (WMI) was
assessed using fractional anisotropy, whereas fluid reasoning (FR) and
Processing Speed (PS) were assessed using standardized psychometric
measures. We hypothesized that strong WMI, measured across the
whole brain, would predict both FR and PS. To evaluate this hypothesis,
we tested two models: (a) high WMI leads to both FR and PS, and (b)
high WMI leads to high PS only, and this, in turn, is predictive of FR. The
results from these analyses indicated that the second hypothesis was
more tenable. In particular, the findings indicate that whole-brain WMI
is predictive of PS (? = .61, p < .01) and this, in turn, predicts FR (? = .84, p
< .01). According to this model, including the direct path from WMI to
FR was not necessary (?2 (1) = 0.56, p = .81). These findings illustrate the
influence of global white matter integrity on the structural relations
between FR and PS for children and adolescents. As neural pathways are
reinforced during development, they influence PS directly, which in turn
influences FR.

GREATER NEURAL PATTERN DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN SIMPLE AND
COMPLEX ADDITION IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER ARITHMETICAL
ABILITIES Sarit Ashkenazi1, Miriam Rosenberg-Lee1, Vinod Menon1;
1Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences Stanford University School of

Medicine — What is the relationship between brain activity and task performance in cognitive domains? We investigated this question by comparing two types of addition problems in a verification task (e.g. 3 + 4 =
7) in 41 children (age 7-9). In complex problems: one operand ranged
from 2 to 9, the other from 2 to 5; in simple problems: one of the operands was always ‘1’. The two conditions have the same sensory and
response selection demands; but have different arithmetic processing
76

demands. We used fMRI to compare brain activation between problem
types. GLM analysis revealed that the complex compared to the simple
problems, had higher activation in left lateral parietal areas. However, in
none of these regions was activity significantly correlated with task performance. Next, we examined the similarity between the representation
of simple and complex problems in cytoarchitectonically defined maps
of parietal cortex. Representational similarity analysis considers the
voxel-wise similarity between the activation patterns of task conditions
within a region of interest (ROI). We hypothesized that the simple and
complex conditions will have different representation in the brain areas
that specifically process quantities, so we considered the intraparietal
sulcus (IPS). The results indicated that dissimilarity levels in a left anterior IPS region predict individual differences in performance. Specifically, as the dissimilarity increases (i.e. larger differences between the
patterns of activity for complex and simple) participants were faster and
more accurate. These results suggest 1) Patterns of activation rather than
levels of activity are fundamental for understanding variation in cognitive performance. 2) Distinct representations underlie task performance.

STUDYING A SIMPLE METHOD TO COMMUNICATE WITH A SINGLE
CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE Eric Altschuler1, Resha Soni1, Ahmed Meleis1;
1New Jersey Medical School — The

ability to be able to easily communicate
with a single cerebral hemisphere would be of tremendous theoretical,
practical (performance training and game playing) and clinical value.
Currently, to communicate with a single cerebral hemisphere it is necessary to use an invasive procedure—intracarotid administration of
sodium amobarbital—study the exceedingly rare commissurotomy
patient or use an unwieldy and expensive apparatus with a bite bar and
eye tracker. Leung et al. (Vision Sciences Society Annual Meeting 2008
Program page 10) found that when two random dot displays are cycled
at 75 Hz individuals observe that the screen appears a uniform grey.
However, when one moves one’s eyes, saccades, or blinks the screen
then appears just the random dot pattern. With someone thus fixating on
the center of the screen, stimuli can be shown on the left or right (or further top/bottom left/right) of the screen. Such images in the left (right)
visual field will then go to only the right (left) cerebral hemisphere!
Using this method we have replicated the known advantage of the left
over the right hemisphere for reading in right-handers. For right-handed
subjects there was no significant difference in reading ability between
hemispheres for 1-3 letter words. However, for 4-8 letter words there
was a very significant advantage of the left hemisphere for words of
these lengths in aggregate (p<0.001) and for each individual letter
length. For right-handed subjects there was no significant difference in
reading ability for either hemisphere for words of any length individually or in aggregate.

MANIPULATING INFORMATION STRUCTURE AS A METHOD OF
LOCALIZING INFORMATION PROCESSING IN THE BRAIN Michael

Ramscar1, Samuel McClure1; 1Stanford University — When formalized in
terms of prediction and cue competition, symbolic learning takes two
forms: learning to predict labels from the features of objects and events,
or learning to predict features from labels. When the information available in training is structured in one or another of these formats, qualitative differences in symbolic learning occur. Discrimination learning is
facilitated when objects precede labels, because the structure of information promotes cue competition between individual features. However,
this competition is inhibited when labels predict objects (Ramscar et al,
2010). We report an fMRI investigation of these Feature-Label-Ordering
effects in learning. Participants were trained and tested on a categorylearning task while the frequency of confusable categories was manipulated so that successful discrimination was essential to successful categorization. Participants trained to predict labels from features showed
higher levels of dorsal striatal activity (caudate and putamen), which
correlated with overall performance at test. The opposite pattern was
observed with ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activation, which
Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Sunday, April 3, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session B
was greater in participants trained to predict labels from features, and
which correlated negatively with performance on the difficult to discriminate low frequency items. The increased striatal activity we
observed in the Feature-to-Label-trained participants is consistent with
evidence linking this area to discrimination learning, while the correlation between VLPFC activity and poorer discrimination in the Label-toFeature-trained participants supports the idea that the structure of information in training forced participants to rely on working memory, fixating on cues that were frequent, salient, and yet ultimately uninformative.

fMRI neurofeedback to increase the functional connectivity between the
right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) and right anterior insula
(AI), which has been associated with metacognitive awareness. Together
with real-time fMRI neurofeedback, mindfulness increased the functional connectivity between the lateral PFC and AI, providing more
direct support for their joint role in metacognitive awareness. Thus, combining objective neuroimaging measures with subjective reports
informed by meditation can lead to more specific theories about the
underlying brain dynamics of spontaneous thought.

Franco3, Helen S. Mayberg3, Xiaoping P. Hu3; 1University of Arkansas for
Medical Sciences, 2Baylor College of Medicine, 3Emory University — We pre-

viously proposed spatially constrained spectral clustering for parcellating human functional neuroimaging data into an atlas of functionally
independent subunits. Such an atlas would advance neuroimaging
methods by providing standardized regions of interest (ROIs) for acrossstudy comparisons, and by reducing the number of timecourses analyzed by statistical methods that are otherwise computationally intractable. Using resting-state fMRI data from 41 healthy control participants,
we generated 100 atlases (ranging from 10 to 1000 ROIs in increments of
10). Cross-validity, content validity, and construct validity approaches
were used to determine the ideal atlas. Leave-one-out cross-validation
identified atlases with fewer than 300 ROIs as having the greatest reproducibility across participants. Content validity was assessed by examining these atlases for several neuroanatomic features such as bilateral
symmetry and separation of cingulate from frontal cortex. The 120ROI
atlas met the most neuroanatomic criteria with the fewest ROIs. Construct validity was assessed by an independent component analysis
(ICA) of a separate resting-state dataset with a)all voxels, b)120ROI atlas,
c)AFNI’s Talairach-Tournoux atlas (TTatlas), and d)the Automated Anatomic Labeling (AAL) atlas. All atlases produced motor and visual networks comparable to (i.e. sharing high spatial correlation with) the
voxelwise analysis. However, networks recruiting prefrontal cortex were
better reproduced by the 120ROI atlas than either anatomic atlas. We
attribute this disparity to the capability of anatomically and cytoarchitecturally homogenous frontal regions (such as Brodmann area 9) to mediate diverse cognitive tasks. These findings suggest that functionally
derived atlases are more suitable for fMRI analyses than anatomically
derived atlases.

Fielding Graduate University, 3University of Toronto — Spontaneous mental

processes (e.g., mind wandering) take up as much as one-third of our
waking lives and are thus crucial areas for scientific inquiry. However,
the lack of methods for direct, immediate, and reliable observation of
spontaneous thought during neuroimaging experiments means its neural correlates remain unclear. Vipassana or mindfulness meditation,
which trains introspective observation of moment-to-moment mental
processes (i.e., metacognitive awareness), can provide the first-person
expertise required for more precise investigations of spontaneous
thought. Thus, rather than simply studying the effects of meditation on
brain and behavior, we used experienced Vipassana meditators in fMRI
experience sampling and neurofeedback paradigms to investigate the
neural bases of spontaneous thought generation and awareness. To
examine spontaneous thought generation, subjects practiced mindfulness during fMRI experience sampling, pressing a button whenever a
thought (e.g., inner speech, images) arose. Reports of spontaneously arising thoughts were preceded by enhanced activation of the brain’s
default network, consistent with its hypothesized involvement in the
generation of spontaneous thought content. To examine spontaneous
thought awareness, subjects practiced mindfulness during real-time

ship between brain chemistry and creative cognition is a topic that has
been poorly researched. Based on previous studies analyzing the lateralization of creativity in the brain, and studies showing concentrations of
N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) relating to cognitive ability and creativity
(Jung et al., 2009); we sought to analyze metabolite lateralization in the
brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1HMRSI). Our study was comprised of 60 healthy young adults (27
Females). Subjects did not differ significantly in terms of age (mean =

measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI).
The Composite Creativity Index (CCI) was derived by summation of the
Free Condition and Four Line Condition of the Design Fluency Test
(DFT), and Uses of Objects Test (UOT). The Consensual Assessment

left – NAA right). We then conducted a step-wise linear regression with
each metabolite (NAA, Choline, Creatine) against the CCI. We found
that relatively high NAA concentration in the right hemisphere of the
brain predicted low CCI scores and, conversely relatively high left hemisphere NAA compared to right predicted high CCI scores (F = 12.7, p =
0.001, r2 = 0.182). These findings contradict the popular notion that creativity is localized in the right hemisphere.

THE TIMING OF SPACE AND TIME IN PERCEPTUAL CAUSALITY Adam J.

Woods1, Matthew Lehet1, Annika Hillebrandt1, Anjan Chatterjee1; 1University
of Pennsylvania — The ability to infer causality is central to human cognition (Michotte, 1946/1963). Temporal contiguity and spatial continuity
contribute to the perception of causality in simple launching events
(Straube & Chatterjee, 2010). Individuals in our previous research were
typically more sensitive to time (75%) than space (35%). Our experiments, like others, depicted launching events in which violations of temporal contiguity preceded violations of spatial continuity. We evaluated
whether this order of relevant information influenced sensitivities to
time or space for causal judgments. Participants (n=16) viewed launching events comprised of a blue ball approaching and contacting a red
ball, which then moved away. Spatial continuity was parametrically
manipulated with changes in the spatial angle of approach for the blue
ball (0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30, 45, or 60 degrees) and temporal contiguity with
different time delay before initial movement of the red ball (0, 33, 67, 100,
133, 200, or 267ms). Thus, the angle of the first moving ball was variable,
unlike previous research in which the angle of the second ball varies.
Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that 87.5% of participants
were sensitive to violations of spatial continuity and 81% to violations of
temporal contiguity. Compared to Straube & Chatterjee (2010), highlighting spatial variability first influenced sensitivity to space (?2=10.5,
p=.001) without decreasing sensitivity to time (?2=.18, p=.7). These
results suggest that while both space and time contribute to the perception of causality, time does so more robustly, and the relative contribution of space to perceptual causality is itself modified by timing.

FRONTAL VERSUS PARIETAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
CHILDREN’S NUMBER CONCEPTS Edward M. Hubbard1, Bruce D.

McCandliss1; 1Vanderbilt University — During early elementary schooling
(K-3), children’s number concepts undergo radical changes, especially in
the small number range (5-9, the “counting range”) where children can
perform exact calculations. One of these critical conceptual changes is an
increased understanding of the larger/smaller relations between numbers. While parietal regions are sensitive to differences in non-symbolic
quantity in 4-month old infants, symbolic processing of quantities in this
range depends on frontal circuitry more in children than in adults. To
examine frontal and parietal contributions to symbolic and non-symbolic
quantity processing in the counting range, we modified an fMRI-adaptation paradigm that has previously demonstrated quantity sensitivity in
children and adults. Arrays of dots of a standard quantity (6 or 8) were
presented repeatedly, alternated with rare deviants that were either
numerically close to or far from (5 or 9) the standard, in either the same
format (dots) or a different format (digits). Children and adults showed
larger responses to far deviants than to close deviants (context-dependent dishabituation), but these responses included frontal regions in
children that were not activated in adults. Additionally, responses to
symbolic quantity differed: For adults, we observed context-dependent
dishabituation for both dots and digits, while for children contextdependent dishabituation was reliably observed for dots, but was less
reliable for digits. These results suggest that understanding numerical
relations and explicit representations of the links between quantities and
symbols are initially effortful processes, mediated by prefrontal cortex,
with increasing practice and automaticity leading to increased specialization of parietal brain regions.

section — Soghra Akbari Chermahini & Bernhard Hommel Leiden University Cognitive Psychology Unit & Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition Leiden, The Netherlands Creative acts do not reflect the operation
of just one process, brain area, or faculty but the interplay of multiple
cognitive processes and neural networks. Importantly, the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) seems to play an important role in organizing this
interplay. So experiment 1 investigated: whether the spontaneous Eye
Blink Rate (EBR) -a well-established clinical marker (Shukla, 1985)
thought to index striatal DA production (Karson, 1983; Taylor et al.,
1999)- would covariate with the individual performance of two types of
creativity tasks, requiring divergent and convergent thinking, and experiment 2 investigated: a) whether mood induction has an effect on EBR; b)
How is benefit of positive mood induction for people with different level
of EBR. Results of two experiments show that flexibility in divergent
thinking varies with the individual dopamine level (as assessed by spontaneous eye-blink rates; EBRs) in terms of an inverted U-shape pattern
and improves with better mood in low but not medium-EBR subjects. In
contrast, the quality of convergent thinking decreases with increasing
dopamine levels Keyword: Creativity, Divergent thinking, Convergent

Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK, 2The University of Dundee, Dundee, UK —
Theories of Grounded Cognition suggest that basic sensory-motor concepts help to acquire and organize abstract concepts. In our event-related
fMRI study, we asked whether the human cortical motor system is part
of the representation of numbers, and whether organization of numerical

78

knowledge is influenced by individual finger counting habits. Recent
studies in human neuroimaging and developmental neuropsychology
indicate that neural systems for perception and action are also engaged
during higher cognitive processes. For number processing, developmental studies suggest a link between numerals and finger counting habits
due to the acquisition of numerical skills through finger counting in
childhood. In the current study single-digits 1 to 9 and corresponding
number words were presented visually to groups of adults who either
usually start counting with their left hand (left-starters) or with their
right hand (right-starters). Participants performed a simple stimulus distinction task which required foot pedal responses. Depending on participants’ finger counting habits, effects of hemispheric lateralization for
small numerals (both digits and number words ‘1’ to ‘5’) were found in
primary and pre-motor cortical areas: more left-hemispheric activation
was found in the group of right-starters, and more right-hemispheric
activation was found in the group of left-starters. Therefore, processing
of numerical concepts activates brain areas that reflect the individually
variable repertoire of finger counting. This provides neuroscientific evidence that number processing is grounded in sensory-motor experience.

SHOULD MY MIND RELY ON MY HUNCH? THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE
OF ACCURATE AND INACCURATE INTUITIONS DURING PROBLEM
SOLVING Azurii K. Collier1, Ken Paller1, Paul Reber1, Mark Beeman1;

1Northwestern University — During intuitive decision-making, does an
individual’s subjective experience vary systematically according to the
accuracy of the intuition? We investigated whether intuition would
relate to the ability to make accurate coherence judgments, the relationship between differential confidence in accurate vs inaccurate intuitive
decisions, and the subjective experience of “liking” related words during
problem solving. Participants worked on Compound Remote Associate
(CRA) problems, in which they viewed three words (crab, sauce, pine)
and had to generate another word (apple) that formed a compound
word with each of the trial words (crabapple, apple sauce, pineapple).
Seventy CRAs shown were coherent (i.e., solvable) and thirty were incoherent (i.e., unsolvable). Participants (n=35) had five seconds to make a
coherence judgment and then were asked to rate how confident they
were in their coherence judgment on a Likert scale of 1-7. Immediately
after each problem and ratings, participants viewed seven words one at
a time and rated how much they liked each word on the same Likert
scale. Unbeknownst to the participant, after each coherent trial, one of
the words presented was the solution word and the other words were
unrelated. There was a significant association between participants’
coherence judgments and the actual coherence of the problem. Of the
unsolved problems, participants demonstrated higher confidence following accurate coherence judgments (i.e., hits and correct rejections)
compared to inaccurate coherence judgments (i.e., misses and false
alarms). Taken together, these data suggest intuition can reliably facilitate accurate decision-making during problem solving.

and age to a group of typically developing children (TD) (n = 10). No significant differences were found on standardized measures of reading
and mathematics, assessed by the WIAT-II. During fMRI scanning, children verified addition equations (e.g. 7+2 = 9). Level of difficulty was
manipulated by having two types of problems: Simple where one of the
addends was equal to ‘1’ (e.g. 3+1=4), and Complex where none of the
addends was ‘1’ (e.g. 5+3=8). Performance in the scanner did not differ
between the groups on either accuracy or reaction times. Both groups

activated frontal and parietal cortex regions associated with numerical
and arithmetical processing in children. However, TDs had greater prefrontal cortex activation than children with ASD. In contrast, children
with ASD had greater activation in posterior visual areas and the right
hippocampus. In children with ASD, visual cortex responses were
inversely correlated with reaction time, whereas the opposite pattern
held for TD children. In the right hippocampus, greater activity was
associated with higher scores on the Numerical Operations subtest of the
WIAT-II in the ASD group only. Our results suggest that children with
ASD engage an atypical set of brain areas during arithmetic and further
point to the hippocampus as a key brain region underlying an ‘islet of

Mind Research Network — Intelligence is defined as “The aggregate or

global capacity of the individual to act purposefully, to think rationally,
and to deal effectively with his environment” (Wechsler, 1944). Measures of intelligence have been well linked with educational and occupational attainment and recently linked with health outcomes (Batty et al.,
2004) and even longevity (Gottfredson et al., 2004). Intelligence scores
have also been systematically linked with brain biochemistry, white matter integrity and cortical volume (Jung & Haier, 2007). We were interested whether intelligence would be related to basic physiological
processes, such as the neuronal correlates of median nerve stimulation.
Subjects were scanned with a 306 channel Elekta NeuroMag scanner.
Intelligence was measured with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Subjects for the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) somatosensory experiment were normal, college educated, subjects with high
average intelligence (Mean = 114.7, standard deviation = 12.7). In 19 subjects, controlling for age, we found a significant relationship (r = .58, p =
.01, r2 = .34) between the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient and the peak
latency in the left sensory cortex of the M20 response elicited from
median nerve stimulation of the dominant (right) hand. This same relationship was found on a second MEG run conducted on a second day (r
= .45, p = .04). To our knowledge, this is the first report wherein individual differences in intelligence accounts for significant variance (.34) in
such basic brain-behavior processes.

NEUROFEEDBACK Alexei Smaliy1, Joseph Dien1, Timothy G. George1, Henk
J. Haarmann1; 1University of Maryland, College Park — We

previously
reported a method for boosting performance on a creative problem-solving task that combined incubation with EEG neurofeedback (NFB)
(Haarmann, et al., 2010). The NFB was aimed at modulating the alphaband power of an electrode over right parieto-occipital cortex (i.e., PO8),
in view of its association with insight solutions (Jung-Beeman et al.,
2004). In our NFB study, subjects who showed a high change in alpha
power at this site solved more creativity problems. Here we present a
new analysis of the EEG data from this study to determine whether the
effect of the NFB on alpha power was global or localized to right parietooccipital cortex. Forty-seven healthy adults received 30 minutes of EEG
neurofeedback using a visual stimulus while their whole-head EEG was
recorded. The NFB was aimed at increasing alpha power over PO8 in
one participant group and at decreasing it in another group. A scree test
indicated the presence of three substantial alpha-band topographies. A
right parieto-occipital alpha component interacted significantly (p<.05)
with training segment and group. The other two components (left parieto-occipital alpha and frontal alpha) did not significantly respond to
these two factors . These results indicate that EEG neurofeedback using a
learning signal from PO8 induces a topographically selective increase in
alpha activity rather than an unselective global increase.

AN MEG INVESTIGATION INTO THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF BASIC
MATHEMATICAL PROCESSING Douglas K. Bemis1, Liina Pylkkänen1;
1New York University — The

neural bases underlying mathematical calculation have been the subject of an extensive number of hemodynamic
investigations (see Arsalidou & Taylor, 2010). The preponderance of evidence implicates the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) as critically involved in all
numerical processing (Dehaene et al., 2003). Additionally, an extended
network of neural regions including the posterior superior parietal lobe,
angular gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) also play
varying roles during mathematical processing, depending upon the
required calculation and context. Several EEG studies have investigated
the time course of these processes, generally finding two posterior positivities during calculation, suggested to reflect basic calculation (350ms)
and problem difficulty (550ms) (Ku et al., 2010). However, the spatial
limitation of EEG prevents a straightforward mapping between these
positivities and past fMRI results. In our study, we sought to elucidate
this connection using MEG, which possesses the fine-grained temporal
resolution of EEG but with an increased spatial resolution. We employed
a minimal paradigm investigating basic calculation (i.e. the addition of
two small numbers) that isolated increases in activity at the precise point
that calculation commenced compared to non-additive (i.e. working
memory) processing of identical stimuli. We found three periods of
increased activity within the left IPS during addition, peaking at 250ms,
350ms, and 500ms. The first effect was also accompanied by a significant
increase in activity in the left DLPFC. These results support previous
fMRI evidence implicating both regions in basic addition (e.g. Audoin et
al., 2005) and provide an initial temporal map of their dynamics during
calculation.

UNDERSTANDING LESS THAN NOTHING: AN FMRI STUDY OF NEGATIVE
NUMBER COMPARISONS Margaret M. Gullick1, George L. Wolford1, Elise

Temple1; 1Dartmouth College — Little work has examined how the mental
number system accommodates counterintuitive quantities like negative
numbers, which extend the left end of the mental number line and
reverse the established relationship between digit magnitude and value.
This study aimed to determine whether adults demonstrate differences
between responses to negative and positive numbers in a simple comparison task performed during an fMRI session. Mixed pairs (with one
positive and one negative number) were also included. Different patterns were seen within each sign condition. Negative number comparison pair responses were slowest and least accurate, but showed a
behavioral (close pair responses slower than far) and neural (greater
intraparietal sulcus activity for close pairs than far) distance effect. No
distance effect was seen for positive pairs either behaviorally or neurally,
potentially due to paradigm design. Interestingly, mixed pair responses
were fastest, but varied in effect directions. Polarity sensitive pairs,
requiring attention to the minus sign for accuracy, showed faster far than
close pair responses and no significant neural effect of distance; insensitive pairs (in which sign was irrelevant) evoked a reverse behavioral and
neural distance effect. This pattern may indicate that participants used
an integrated, holistic strategy for polarity sensitive pairs but a componential one for polarity insensitive. Adults may demonstrate a mature
bidirectional number line, but usage of negatives remains different from
that of positives. This work expands our knowledge of the flexibility of
the mental number system and its ability to represent difficult quantities.

(RLPFC), as essential for analogical reasoning. However, relatively little
is known about the computations performed by this ares of the brain that
enable analogical processing. Early models of analogy hypothesized that
the reasoner must first extract the relations between entities before mapping between relations. Bunge et al. (2009) designed a study that used
fMRI methods to separate these operations. Across blocks of trials, participants either judged whether pairs of geometric objects were similar
with respect to shape or texture (extraction) or whether two pairs of
objects possessed the same abstract relation (mapping). The contrast
between the mapping and extraction tasks was used to isolate relational
integration (i.e., analogical mapping). Bunge et al. found differences in
activation in left RLPFC. In order to study the time course of this activation and to investigate potential strategy differences, electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected during task performance. Subtractions
of the extraction from the mapping task yielded event-related potentials
(ERPs) that differed in mean amplitude in bilateral prefrontal electrodes
beginning around 300 ms and continuing until response, and the voltage
for the analogy condition was strongly correlated with accuracy, thus
confirming the importance of PFC in analogy. However, the subtraction
also yielded a difference in the N170, an ERP component frequently
associated with analytic versus holistic processing. Together, these findings are consistent with fMRI studies suggesting RLPFC activity reflects
the number of relations analytically processed during problem solving.

Christopher Tyler1, Spero Nicholas1; 1Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute,
San Francisco — To target cognitive calculation processes per se, the
present study used non-repeating three-digit numbers, requiring the full
calculation process on each trial. The further purpose of the present
study was to break the mental calculation task down into a set of sequential operations and determine the role of each cognitive component to
the contributory subnetworks of the cortical processing. BOLD
responses were measured throughout the human brain with a time-jittered event-related design for sequenced stimuli consisting of a numeric
equation followed by a 3-digit trial solution and an error feedback symbol. To estimate the temporal characteristics of the neural signals in each
activated cortical region, a biophysically-based forward-optimization
procedure for the functional imaging waveforms was constrained by a
plausible parametrized model of local neural population responses, convolved with an overall hemodynamic response. For the calculation
phase the pattern of activation was strongly bilateral throughout the cortex, with activation of the supplementary motor area, the ventral motor
area, ventrolateral prefrontal area, intraparietal sulcus, fornix, and
grapheme area of the ventral temporal lobe, and the peripheral representation of primary visual cortex (V1). While the responses to the initial
number and operator presentations were typically brief throughout retinotopic cortex, responses in IPS1-4 showed strong involvement number
memory and calculation, while IPS5 was predominantly active during
the evaluation and response selection for the trial solution. Waveform
optimization allows estimation of the neural signal dynamics underlying
the BOLD waveforms in the processing sequence throughout the cortex
during a demanding calculation task.

HOW HYPOTHESIS-CONFIRMING AND HYPOTHESIS-DISCONFIRMING
INFORMATION IS TREATED ACROSS THE PSYCHOSIS CONTINUUM

Ryan Balzan1, Paul Delfabbro1, Cherrie Galletly1; 1University of Adelaide —
Background: In recent years there has been increasing attention to how
individuals with active delusions and those identified as “delusionprone” treat hypothesis-confirming and -disconfirming information. Initial research suggested that individuals with delusions typically exhibit a
jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias when administrated the probabilistic
reasoning “beads task” (i.e., decisions made on limited evidence and/or
decisions are over-adjusted in light of disconfirming evidence). More
recent research instead proposes that that the “beads task” may instead
represent a hyper-salience to hypothesis-evidence matches. Moreover,

80

other tasks have found that disconfirming evidence is actually ignored
rather than being over-adjusted to. This study attempted to clarify this
set of findings across two cognitive-reasoning tasks. Methods: A total of
75 participants were recruited, consisting of 25 individuals diagnosed
with schizophrenia and 50 controls (25 delusion-prone; 25 non-delusion
prone, as identified with the Peters et al Delusions Inventory). Cognitive
tasks employed included two “confirmation bias” tasks, where participants evaluated pieces of information which were either consistent or
conflicting with the given hypothesis. Results: The results suggested that
people with delusions and delusion-prone individuals were hypersalient to hypothesis-confirming evidence, whilst tending to downplay
hypothesis disconfirming information, as compared to healthy controls.
Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest individuals with
delusions are more hyper-salient to hypothesis-evidence matches yet
under-employ disconfirming evidence. This bias may influence delusion
formation and/or maintenance.

THE ROLE OF OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY IN THE COMPARISON OF
COMPETING HYPOTHESES DURING A PROBABILISTIC REASONING
TASK Jennifer Whitman1, Todd Woodward1; 1University of British
Columbia — We used MEG to investigate the oscillatory activity involved
in making comparative judgments between competing hypotheses. On
each trial of our probabilistic reasoning task, participants judged the
probability that a given focal hypothesis, rather than its alternative, was
true. Evidence was objectively quantifiable and visually presented. The
focal hypothesis was either more or less probable than the alternative to
which it was compared, and the comparison was either difficult (similar
levels of support) or easy (very different levels of support). Oscillatory
activity was localized onto each individual's structural MRI using a
DICS beamformer as implemented in Fieldtrip software. Beta (18-24 Hz)
power decreased along the precentral and postcentral gyri contralateral
to the hand used for responding. Alpha (8-12 Hz) power decreased bilaterally in superior and inferior parietal cortex (BA7 & 40), the middle and
inferior occipital gyri (BA 39 & 19), and the cerebellum. Theta (3-7 Hz)
power increased bilaterally in the lingual gyri and calcarine fissure (BA
17 & 18), the medial superior frontal gyrus (BA 8 & 9), and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (BA11). Both increases in theta activity and suppression
of alpha activity were modulated more by difficult comparisons than by
easy ones. This is consistent with the interpretation that both processes
are involved in the optimal allocation of attentional resources in
response to cognitive difficulty.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common impairing neurodevelopmental disorders. Individuals with ASDs have difficulty extracting
meaning from complex patterns of reinforcement. The goal of the study
was to investigate the neural substrates of this deficit using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and to relate findings to repetitive
behavior symptoms in affected individuals. Participants were young
adults aged 18 – 40 with ASDs (n=8) and age, IQ, and gender-matched
controls (n=12). They were scanned while completing a probabilistic
reinforcement learning task including three stimulus pairs with 80%,
70%, and 60% valid reinforcement contingencies. Two hypotheses were
derived from a model of the inter-workings of prefrontal cortex (PFC),
orbito-frontal cortex (OFC), and basal ganglia (BG) during the paradigm
(Frank et al., 2004). These were (1) that individuals with ASDs would
show less activation in fronto-striatal neural circuits required for flexible
learning, and (2) that repetitive behaviors would be associated with poor
top down control of the BG. The probability of learning (assessed by

ganglia in neurotypical adults. In individuals with ASDs, rituals/sameness behavior was negatively associated with activation in the OFC (r = .67, p = .098) and positively associated with activation in the putamen
(r=.64, p =.12). Findings provide support for the hypotheses of the model
that ASDs involve atypical activation in fronto-striatal neural circuits,
which are related to repetitive behaviors found in the disorders

REPETITION SUPPRESSION FMRI REVEALS DOMAIN-SPECIFIC AND
DOMAIN-GENERAL COMPONENTS OF THE THEORY OF MIND
NETWORK Adam S. Cohen1, Scott T. Grafton1, Michael B. Miller1, Tamsin C.

German1; 1University of California Santa Barbara — Central to social cognition is the ability to explain, predict, and interpret another person’s
behavior in terms of mental states. The current study concerns whether
there are specialized mechanisms for processing beliefs, desires, intentions, and other mental states or general-purpose mechanisms that process not only mental representations but also non-mental, "other"
representations such as photos, maps, and signs. On each trial, participants read a hybrid false-belief/false-other story followed by a primetarget sentence pair that related back to the story. Participants had to
provide true/false responses to each of the two statements, which were
either about mental or non-mental representations. We predicted that if
there are domain-specific mechanisms that support theory of mind, then
we would observe repetition suppression of the BOLD signal whenever
mental primes preceded mental targets and release from suppression
when non-mental primes preceded mental targets. Suppression of the
BOLD response in temporal parietal junction (TPJ) was observed in the
mental-mental condition. As predicted, release from suppression in TPJ
was observed in the other-mental condition, but only in the right hemisphere. In the left hemisphere, suppression persisted even when mental
targets were preceded by non-mental primes. This suggests that specialization might be lateralized to the right hemisphere, whereas left-lateralized parts of the theory of mind system have a broader response profile.
These results are considered with respect to theories that differ in their
emphasis on specializations in theory of mind processing.

B111
THE NEURAL BASIS OF NON-VERBAL ANALOGICAL REASONING

Christine E. Watson1, Anjan Chatterjee1; 1University of Pennsylvania — Reasoning analogically requires the ability to ignore superficial features of
stimuli and appreciate abstract, relational similarities, instead. Only
recently has attention turned from the behavioral to the neural basis of
analogical reasoning, with most studies implicating left anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) as critical for analogy. Many studies have used verbal
stimuli, potentially contributing to the lateralization of aPFC activity.
Moreover, analogical reasoning is often more difficult than reasoning
tasks that do not require attention to relational similarities, appropriately
matched control condition are sometimes not used. We used functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants solved non-verbal, visuospatial analogies. While the analogy task required participants
to evaluate the abstract similarities between the colored shapes used as
stimuli, the high-level, perceptually identical control task only required
attention to concrete stimulus features. Based on previous studies of
analogy and abstract spatial relations, we predicted greater activity during the analogy task in aPFC, inferior frontal gyri, and parietal cortex.
Conversely, we predicted greater activity during the control task in areas
involved in object identification. Within anatomically-defined regionsof-interest (ROIs), we observed greater activity during the analogy task
in right, but not left, aPFC. We also found greater involvement of right
inferior parietal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus ROIs in analogical reasoning. No differences between analogy and the high-level control were
observed in object identification areas. These results suggest that the lateralization of aPFC involvement depends on the visual or verbal nature
of the stimuli or information derived during the analogical reasoning
process.

RAPID DETECTION AND FOCUSING OF ATTENTION TOWARD AUDITORY
TARGETS EMBEDDED IN AN ARRAY OF AUDITORY STREAMS Marissa
Gamble1, Marty Woldorff1; 1Duke University — Gamble and Luck (In Press)

recently reported an electrophysiological correlate (termed the “N2ac”)
of lateralized auditory attentional focusing toward target sounds during
simultaneously presented left and right auditory stimulation, similar to
the N2pc, which has been used to study lateralized shifts of attention
within visual arrays. Here, we investigated the neural dynamics of auditory target detection and attentional focusing when the stimuli are distributed across both time and space. Each trial consisted of ten 40millisecond sounds (half to each ear, in pseudo-random order), separated by 10-ms interstimulus intervals. Eight of the ten sounds were
standards and two were deviants (a high and a low tone), presented to
opposing ears. On each run, one of the deviant types was designated as
the target, with pseudo-randomized target/nontarget presentation side
and within-trial order. Participants attended for the designated target
deviant within the tone series and discriminated whether it was pure or
amplitude modulated. Subtracting the standard-tone ERP (on the same
side) from the nontarget ERP yielded the contribution of the mismatch
negativity (MMN). By comparing the target-minus-standard and the
nontarget-minus standard difference waves contralateral to the tone, the
N2ac activity specific to the lateralized focus of attention toward the target could be isolated. This activity started ~120 ms after target onset and
closely followed the MMN. Furthermore, enhanced activity to the target,
compared to the nontarget, in the N1/MMN latency range was
observed. This suggests an early preparatory top-down template for the
target sound, despite lack of foreknowledge of its location or timing.

DOES THE TEMPORAL ORIENTING LATE POSITIVITY REFLECT MOTOR

Duesseldorf, Department of Experimental Psychology — It has been shown
repeatedly that temporal orienting enhances a late, P3-like positivity even for stimuli that do not require any response. The present study
tested a motor inhibition account of this effect, which has recently been
proposed as an explanation of the NoGo-P3. In a temporal orienting
task, the participants were asked to respond when a rare violin or piano
sound (deviant) was presented at the time point indicated by the cue, but
not when a burst of white noise (standard) was presented. Only stimuli
at the attended time point required a response. Therefore, motor activation should be higher for the attended than the unattended time point.
Because standard stimuli never required any response, these should trigger motor inhibition, particularly if presented at an attended time point.
Crucially, the amount of advance knowledge about the possible
response alternatives was also varied: More specific advance knowledge
about the possible response should lead to an overall increase of motor
activation and should, consequently, require even stronger motor inhibi-

82

tion in the case of a standard stimulus. In a specific preparation condition, the same response was required for both types of deviants. In an
unspecific preparation condition, violin and piano sounds required different responses. Thus, if the enhanced P3-like positivity to temporally
attended standard stimuli reflects enhanced motor inhibition, this effect
should be larger for the specific preparation condition than for the
unspecific preparation condition. Consistent with this notion, the P3-like
positivity was larger in the specific than the unspecific preparation condition.

IMPAIRED GAP DETECTION DURING CONCURRENT SOUND
PERCEPTION: TOP-DOWN OR BOTTOM-UP EFFECTS? Ada W.S. Leung1,2,

Claude Alain1,2; 1Rotman Research Institute, 2University of Toronto — The perception of a brief silent interval (i.e., gap) is more difficult when listeners
hear two concurrent sounds than when they hear a single sound object.
This impairment may reflect low-level interaction (bottom-up effects) or
a division of attention (top-down effects) among the sounds which interfere with signal detection. To distinguish between these two possibilities,
we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to complex harmonic
tones that might comprise a mistuned harmonic and/or a gap. Sixteen
participants, eleven women and aged between 18 and 35, either indicated on every trial whether the complex sound comprised a gap irrespective of mistuning (active listening) or watched a subtle muted movie
of their choice while the same sounds were presented (passive listening).
The result showed that gap detection performance was lower when the
complex sound comprised a mistuned harmonic that popped out of the
complex as a separate sound object. The analysis of the ERP data
revealed an early gap related activity that was little affected by mistuning during both active and passive listening. However, there was a mark
decrease in the late positive wave that indicated decision and responserelated processes for sounds containing mistuned harmonics during
active listening. In conclusion, the results suggest that the limitation in
detecting the gap is related to attention rather than deficits in encoding
the gap in sensory memory.

FUNCTIONAL BRAIN CONNECTIVITY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS DURING
AUDITORY SELECTIVE ATTENTION Tony Herdman1, Sam Doesburg2;
1University of British Columbia, 2Child and Family Research Institute — We

recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the brain's
functional connectivity in children (11-13 years old) and adults (18-35
years old) performing an auditory selective attention task. Our main
hypothesis was that during selective attention children recruited frontal
networks to a greater extent than adults. We performed time-frequency
analyses on beamformed brain sources for task-dependent event-related
synchronizations (ERS) and desynchronizations (ERD) within six frequency bands spanning from 7 to 90 Hz. We found several significant
ERS and ERD peaks throughout the brain that served as regions of interest for phase-coherence analyses. Cost-efficiency functions and smallworld properties of a brain's network connectivity were determined
using Graph Theory methods. We found that the average adult brain

Sunday, April 3, 1:00 - 3:00 pm, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session C
had large beta-band (15-22 Hz) ERD within temporal, frontal and parietal regions whereas the average child brain had large beta-band ERS
within frontal regions and less prominent beta-band ERD elsewhere.
Functional connectivity results showed wide-spread beta-band phase
desynchronizations throughout the brain, which were larger and more
distributed in adults than children. Notably, children’s beta-band phase
synchronizations showed significant small-world properties with stronger functional couplings between frontal-frontal and frontal-parietal
regions that were not as evident in adults. These findings fit with emerging evidence that children recruit more frontal executive networks to
facilitate control of auditory attention.

TRAINING ATTENTIONAL FILTERING IN TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY Neil

Robertson2, Paul Dockree2; 1Headway, 1-3 Manor Street Business Park, Manor
Street, Dublin 7, Ireland, 2School of Psychology and Trinity College Institute of
Neuroscience, Dublin 2, Ireland — Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury
(TBI) are less able to filter out interfering information (e.g., concurrent
conversations in a room, traffic noise, background music etc. See
Arciniegas et al. 1999; 2000) This debilitating problem means that TBI
patients show impairments when attending to and encoding information. In the current study, TBI patients were engaged in a dichotic listening procedure designed to drive improvements in their signal-to-noise
processing capabilities. Training blocks were administered in eight 1hour blocks conducted once a week over an eight-week period. Training
was based on a modified version of Attention Process Training (Sohlberg
& Mateer, 2001) in which participants were required to sustain attention
and identify infrequent auditory targets. One group of patients (Adaptive Training Group; n=10) were engaged in adaptive training to concurrent and distracting speech noise. Noise intensity was systematically
increased from baseline (no-noise) across five decibel-level steps.
Patients were required to attain auditory target detection performance
equivalent to 80% baseline level before progressing to the next level of
noise distraction. A second group of patients received equivalent attention training with concomitant noise but were not trained adaptively
(non-adaptive training group; n=10). Results from a key outcome measure -speech-in-noise processing - revealed that a linear decline in performance as a function of increasing distraction was offset by training.
To conclude, cognitive remediation techniques for retraining cognitive
deficits after Traumatic Brain Injury can improve engagement with
everyday activities.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF AUDITORY DISTRACTION IN
NORMAL LISTENERS AND LISTENERS WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT
HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER Karla D. Ponjavic1, Matthew S. Tata1;
1

University of Lethbridge — The auditory Event-Related Potential (ERP) has
been used to investigate focused attention. In classic cue-target paradigms the N1 amplitude of the ERP waveform is greater when the target
is validly cued and smaller when invalidly cued. This suggests that early
auditory mechanisms handle task-relevant and task-irrelevant input differently. We tested the hypothesis that N1 amplitude evoked by task-relevant (i.e. attended) stimuli would be modulated by different levels of
distraction, despite a constant endogenous attentional instruction to
maintain focus on the target. We further hypothesized that susceptibility
to distraction would be severe in subjects with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Healthy controls and adults with a prior
diagnosis of ADHD were recruited for this study. The ADHD group was
split into individuals taking stimulant medication (e.g. Ritalin) and those
who were un-medicated. Participants focused their attention on a stream
of long and short noise bursts presented to one ear while simultaneously
ignoring a pre-recorded story (high distraction) or amplitude matched
broadband noise (low distraction) presented to the other ear. Behavioral
data showed significantly higher sensitivity to detect targets (d’) under
low distraction relative to high distraction conditions across all groups.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

N1 amplitude was greater when evoked by targets in the low distraction
relative to high distraction conditions across all groups. Both listener
sensitivity and N1 amplitude varied similarly across groups and across
low and high distraction conditions. These results suggest that modulations of N1 amplitude indicate the degree of distraction in healthy controls and in individuals with ADHD.

THE RELATIONSHIP OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS, SENSORY GATING
AND NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS Emerson Epstein1, Per Lysne1,

Jason Long1, Bobby Sena1, Molly Monnig1, Jessica Pommy1, Jeff Lewine2,
Robert Thoma1; 1University of New Mexico, 2The MIND Research Network —
Sensory gating, a neurophysiologic measure of sensory filtering, is
impaired in psychotic disorders, and some studies have shown impairment in alcohol use disorders (AUD). For the current study, participants
were healthy controls (HC, N = 10), alcohol use disorder-current (AUDC, N = 10), and alcohol use disorder-remission (AUD-R, N = 10). Concurrent EEG and MEG data were collected during an Auditory Paired Click
Paradigm to measure auditory sensory gating, which is the ratio of the
amplitude of responses from two identical stimuli (clicks) presented
with an ISI of 500 ms. The Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC;
Miller, 1996) was also used as a measure of negative consequences of
alcohol use apart from dependence symptoms. A neuropsychological
battery was devised to assess a range of neuropsychological domains
and to test those domains expected to be impaired in those with ETOH
histories. A marginally significant positive correlation was found
between DrInC score and left hemisphere gating in the AUD groups
(r(31) = .33, p = .07), suggesting that alcohol has a harmful effect on left
hemisphere gating over the long term. Further confirmation of this effect
was found in the neuropsychological test scores, with DrInC score predicting poorer sustained attention (CPT overall attention index score,
r(31) = .44, p = .02), and poorer executive ability (Trail Making Test Part
B, r(31) = .36, p = .05) in the AUD groups. These results suggest that left
hemisphere gating as well as cognitive functions are impaired in the
long term by alcohol use disorders.

PARENTING INTERACTS WITH DRD4 TO PREDICT YOUNG CHILDREN’S
ATTENTION AND NON-VERBAL IQ Alice Graham1, Anna Dennis1, Theodore

A. Bell1, Helen J. Neville1; 1University of Oregon — Recent work has emphasized children’s biological sensitivity to context (BSC) as a means of
understanding differential effects of parenting. According to the BSC
hypothesis, genetic factors will be harmful or beneficial depending on
the quality of the caregiving environment. Variation in the DRD4 gene
appears to play a role in determining sensitivity to parenting. Previous
work has identified children carrying the 7r allele of the DRD4 as exhibiting higher levels of externalizing problems in the context of insensitive
parenting, and showing greater gains in the context of parenting interventions. The current study sought to extend this work to the cognitive
domain in a low SES sample of 3-5 year olds. One set of analyses focused
on the influence of traditional parenting values, including an emphasis
on parental control and a structured environment, on children’s selective
auditory attention. A significant interaction between parental traditionalism and children’s DRD4 classification emerged such that traditionalism predicted higher levels of selective attention indexed by ERPs only
for children carrying the 7r allele. For children not carrying the 7r allele
there was no significant effect of traditionalism. In a separate analysis we
examined the effects of an intervention focused increasing child attention and structure in the home. In children carrying the 7r allele the intervention condition was associated with an increase in non-verbal IQ in
comparison to the control group. These results are discussed in the context of the BSC hypothesis and the potential importance of children’s
attention and a structured home environment.

CHANGE DEAFNESS: A CASE OF "MISALLOCATION" OF AUDITORY
ATTENTION Kristina Backer1,2, Claude Alain1,2; 1University of Toronto,

2Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Centre — Change deafness describes
the surprising failure of listeners to detect salient changes in complex
auditory scenes consisting of several concurrent sound objects. The
underlying causes of change deafness are not well understood but could
include a failure in concurrent sound segregation, working memory,
and/or a misallocation of attention. In the present study we investigated
the role of attention in change deafness. First, we generated complex
auditory scenes composed of three different sounds arising from unique
loudspeaker locations. A control experiment was conducted to choose a
subset of auditory scene stimuli, in which the three sounds could be easily segregated, to use in the change deafness experiment. During the
change deafness experiment, we used a delayed match-to-sample paradigm in which participants reported if the two auditory scenes were
identical or different. If they noticed a change, then they indicated which
sounds switched locations. On some trials, participants’ attention was
directed to one sound via a visual spatial or semantic cue (71% valid).
Relative to uncued trials, performance was enhanced (decreased reaction
time (RT) and increased accuracy) when presented with a valid spatial or
semantic cue. However, when attention was invalidly directed to the
non-changing sound in the scene, participants’ performance suffered
(increased RT and decreased accuracy). This suggests that change deafness arises, at least in part, from a “misallocation” of attention to a nonchanging sound, even when listeners can segregate concurrent sounds
within an auditory scene.

VISUAL ATTENTION AND DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA. PARAMETERBASED ASSESSMENT OF DISORDERED AND INTACT COMPONENTS OF
VISUAL ATTENTION Johanna Egetemeir1, Kathrin Finke2, Prisca

Stenneken1; 1Bielefeld University, 2Ludwig Maximilians University Munich —

Despite the clinical heterogeneity of developmental dyslexia, neurocognitive studies have repeatedly described that persons with dyslexia
show impaired performance in tasks which require visual attention.
However, specific aspects of visual attention that may cause this deficit
have not yet been unequivocally identified. In this study, a group of children affected by developmental dyslexia and a matched control group
without any reading disorder performed whole report and partial report
of brief letter arrays. In whole report, five letters were vertically
arranged in the left or right visual hemi-field. Participants had to report
as many letters as possible. In partial report, red target letters were presented either alone or accompanied by a second target or a green distractor letter presented in the same or in the opposite hemi-field. Here,
participants had to report only target letters. Based on mathematical
equations provided by the Theory of Visual Attention (TVA), the
response patterns from these tasks were used to estimate four mathematically independent, quantitative measures of attentional components:
perceptual processing speed, storage capacity of visual working memory, efficiency of top-down control, and spatial distribution of attention.
A comparison of parameter estimates between groups revealed reduced
perceptual processing speed and reduced storage capacity of visual
working memory in the dyslexic group, whereas top-down control and
spatial distribution of attention were unimpaired. Moreover results indicated a correlation between storage capacity of visual working memory
and the severity of the reading disorder. Results are discussed in relation
to a previous TVA-study investigating visual attention in dyslexic
adults.

EXPRESSION OF FACILITATION AND SUPPRESSION IN VISUAL
SELECTIVE ATTENTION IN ADOLESCENTS Jane Couperus1, Brittany

Alperin1; 1Hampshire College — Selective attention modulates activity at

early levels of visual processing, as is reflected in changes in the P1
event-related potential (ERP) component. Recent research suggests that
the process of selection may involve both the relative enhancement of the
signal of the attended stimulus as well as relative suppression of the
unattended stimulus (e.g., Couperus and Mangun, 2010). However,
while studies suggest facilitation is present even in young children (e.g.,
Harter et al., 1989), the development of suppression in visual selective
attention has not been deeply explored. This study examined these two
processes in adolescents (11-15 years) and adults using a spatial cuing
paradigm. We examined target and distracter processing as a function of
the expectancy of distracter presence versus absence. Participants were
cued to the spatial location of a target (100% valid cues) as well as to the
presence or absence of distracters in the opposite hemifield (70% valid
cues). Analysis of distracter-present displays in adults showed that in
addition to relative enhancement of the occipital P1 in the hemisphere
contralateral to the target, processing contralateral to distracters was
reduced when a distractor was anticipated compared to when the presence of a distractor was not anticipated. In contrast, only relative facilitation contralateral to the attended target was seen in adolescents. These
findings suggest that both enhancement and suppression are involved in
visual-spatial selective attention in adults, but that suppression may still
be undergoing development in adolescence.

RELIANCE ON CS-MODULATION VS. US-MODULATION MECHANISMS
FOR BLOCKING IN CATEGORY LEARNING VARY WITH AGE Dale

Swanton1, Mark Gluck1; 1Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience,
Rutgers University, Newark — Blocking refers to the finding that when a
compound of two cues is associated with an outcome, learning about
one of the cues can be prevented if the other cue has been previously
associated with the same outcome (Kamin, 1969). Two competing theories have arisen to account for why learning about a cue can be blocked.
The Rescorla-Wagner model (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) argues that
blocking occurs due to modulation of the reinforcing US's ability to promote learning through reduction in prediction error. Conversely, Mackintosh (1975) posited that blocking occurs because of a modulation of the
cue's ability to enter into learning. Allen, Padilla and Gluck (2002)
offered support for the former US-modulation mechanism in the blocking found during rabbit eye-blink conditioning, while Kruschke and
Blair (2000) offered support for the latter CS-modulation mechanism in
human category learning. In the current experiment, subjects learned to
predict which disease a fictional patient had based on that person’s
symptoms (adapted from Kruschke & Blair, 2000). We found that both
healthy young adults and healthy older adults show the basic blocking
effect and that younger adults show attenuation of the blocked cue in a
transfer test, supporting a US-modulation mechanism. In contrast, older
adults showed no evidence of sustained attenuation of learning to the
previously blocked cue, indicating that their previous learning was
mediated solely by US-modulation mechanisms. The current results suggest that blocking can occur in two qualitatively different ways and that
the mechanism by which blocking occurs may change with age.

ventions. Here, we present a multi-modal assessment (simultaneous
EEG/fMRI) of attentional engagement in young and elderly populations. The oddball task elicits a robust P3 ERP component which is a sensitive biomarker of attention. By using a 3-stimulus oddball we were able
to investigate distinct P3 topographies relating to distractor processing
(P3a) and target detection (P3b). Fourteen elderly (65-80yr) and fifteen
young (18-30yr) participants showed no differences in task performance.
ERP results replicated the well documented P3 age-effects (decreased
amplitude and increased latency). No significant within-or betweengroup differences were found when comparing recordings taken inside
or outside the MRI scanner. Distractor and target onsets were modelled
in an fMRI general linear model with single-trial amplitudes from electrodes FZ and PZ included as parametric modulators. This approach
allowed us to identify unique EEG-informed fMRI activations that were
not apparent when analysing fMRI alone. The elderly group showed
increased activity within the prefrontal cortex(BA9), striatum, and hippocampus during target detection and increased prefrontal(BA44), parietal(BA7), cingulate(BA23) and striatum activity during distractors. It
has been previously shown that ageing produces a general shift in activity from posterior-to-anterior regions. By combining EEG with fMRI we
demonstrate that the elderly group were able to match the attentional
performance of young participants by recruiting a more complicated network of regions, particularly frontal-striatal circuits.

SENIORS SHOW INCREASED VISUAL SENSORY ATTENUATION WHEN
MIND-WANDERING Lindsay Nagamatsu1, Nicole Laurence1, Teresa Liu-

Ambrose1, Todd Handy1; 1University of British Columbia — Mind-wandering
refers to the natural ebb and flow of how much attention we pay to what
we’re doing over time. When in a mind-wandering state, our attention
has momentarily drifted off-task. Recently, it has been shown in young
adults during these “off-task” attentional states, there is a decrease in
visual sensory-evoked activity specific to the upper visual hemifield.
Here we examined the extent to which the visual sensory effects of “offtask” attentional states change with age. Participants (aged 65-75 years)
performed a simple target detection task at fixation while task irrelevant
probes were presented in the upper and lower visual hemifield. At the
end of each task block, participants reported on whether their attention
had been on- vs. off-task. We found that visual sensory-evoked activity
decreased for probes in both hemifields just before reports of off-task vs.
on-task attention, as measured via the P1 ERP component. Our findings
suggest that age-related changes in visual sensitivity during mind-wandering may contribute to clinical problems in seniors, most notably falling.

detection of a change in the acoustic environment that can be measured
in infants, children and adults. The aim of this study was to examine for
the first time the maturational changes of the MMN and the AERPs in
response to both speech and non-speech stimuli, which may respectively
reflect language and attention processing. Using an oddball paradigm,
AERPs were recorded in 24 healthy participants at different developmental stages (4-7 years old, 10-13 years old and young adults (mean
age: 22), n=8 in each group) using a 128-channel Geodesic Sensor Net
and system. Verbal stimuli were the frequent (standard) syllable /Da/
and the rare (deviant) /Ba/; non-verbal stimuli were frequency synthesized, using the second and third formants of the verbal stimuli. Results
revealed group differences in the MMN and AERP components in

response to both verbal and non-verbal stimuli. In young children, the
P1 and N2 components were of higher amplitude and longer duration
compared to those observed in the adult response. N1 and P2 components were not found in the younger children but were present in the
two older groups. A negative mismatch response was elicited in adults
and older children whereas a positive mismatch was observed in the
younger group. These differences in maturation of the cortical activation
in response to speech and non-speech stimuli are discussed in light of
the central auditory development involved in attention and language
processing.

Keck Center for Integrative Neurosciences, University of California, San
Francisco, 2Department of Psychology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR —
Visual working memory performance declines in normal aging and has
often been attributed to interference by distracting sensory information.
However, it has recently been proposed that susceptibility to being ‘captured’ by distracting stimuli may not differ greatly between individuals,
but instead the speed in which one disengages from capture is what varies. Here, we tested younger and older adult’s susceptibility to visual
capture by relevant and irrelevant flankers and their time of disengagement by jittering stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) of the flankers
before the onset of a target array. Using this approach, we demonstrated
that although both age groups were equally captured at the shortest
SOA (50 ms), older participants display a prolonged disengagement
from visual capture in the presence of relevant flankers (?350 ms), compared to younger adults (250 ms). Furthermore, an extended time of disengagement from relevant capture (550 ms) in a subgroup of older
participants was related to lower working memory capacity. A similar
relationship recently found in younger participants, supports the notion
that prolonged disengagement from visual capture of relevant sensory
information may be related to a misallocation of working memory
resources. Therefore, declines in working memory performance commonly reported in normal aging may be the result of a delay in the speed
of disengagement from distracting information and not the result of a
greater magnitude of distraction.

YOUNG CHILDREN CAN ADJUST THE SCALE OF VISUAL SELECTIVE
ATTENTION William Bush1, Jane Couperus2, Lisa Sanders1; 1University of

Massachusetts Amherst, 2Hampshire College — Adults contract or expand
the size of an attended region to match a cued area or attended object
(Eriksen & St. James, 1986; Castiello & Umilta 1990; Eimer, 1999; Muller
& Hubner, 2002). Due to the challenges of measuring covert visual spatially selective attention in young children little is known about the
development of this ability. However, the available behavioral data suggest control of the scale of attention develops later than the ability to orient attention (Enns & Girgus, 1985; Akhtar & Enns, 1989). In the current
study, small and large line drawings of different objects were presented
simultaneously. Nineteen adults and fifteen 4- to 6-year-olds were
instructed to monitor only one of the objects to detect rapid changes in
the color of the lines. Steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs)
were measured time locked to the different flicker rates of the two
objects. Adults evidenced greater amplitude SSVEPs in response to
attended compared to unattended objects. There was no interaction
between attention and object size, suggesting adults are equally capable
of attending to large and small objects. The 4- to 6-year-olds also showed
attention effects on SSVEP amplitude with the same pattern of results
observed in adults. Children in this age group are capable of adjusting
the size of an attended area to facilitate monitoring an object. Further, the
finding that the modulation of SSVEP amplitude was largest over posterior regions suggests that this facilitation occurred at perceptual stages of
processing.

hypothesized that binge-pattern exposure to alcohol during adolescence
would result in reduced frontal lobe activation and poorer scores on tests
of attention and executive ability. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data
and magnetic resonance images (MRI) were collected from thirty adolescent volunteers comprising three groups: ten healthy, non-drinking control adolescents (HC), ten adolescents with DSM-IV criteria for alcohol
abuse or dependence (AUD-C), and ten non-drinking adolescents considered to be at high risk for alcohol use disorders (HR), ages 12-18. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG data were recorded during an auditory
oddball paradigm including standard stimuli (1000 Hz), target stimuli
(1500 Hz) requiring response, and truly novel stimuli, which consisted of
a variety of sounds randomly interspersed among other stimuli. Neural
activation in HC and HR began in sensory cortex, was mirrored shortly
thereafter in cingulate cortex, and then progressed to highly distributed
cortical regions, most notably, strong lateral and medial prefrontal cortical responses in the novel and oddball conditions beginning at approximately 300 ms. There were no group differences in M100 activation in
auditory cortex. In the left lateral prefrontal cortex, HC had greater M300
activation than HR and AUD-C (who were equivalent), suggesting that
left hemisphere abnormality is a risk factor for AUDs. In the right lateral
prefrontal cortex, HC and HR showed equivalent activation and had
greater responses than AUD, suggesting that alcohol use results in
reduced right M300 activation.

MATURATION OF SELECTIVE AUDITORY ATTENTION IN ADOLESCENTS: AN
EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL STUDY Elif Isbell1, Christina Karns1, Helen

Neville1; 1University of Oregon — The ability to selectively attend to relevant
information and to suppress distractors starts developing in the early
years of life. Research has demonstrated that neurophysiological markers of selective auditory attention can be observed in children as young
as 3 years old. However, the characteristics of such neurophysiological
responses observed in children differ markedly from the responses of
adults. While these differences have been documented between adults
and children, there is little research that focuses on how this ability
develops during adolescence and when it matures. To investigate the
development of selective auditory attention throughout adolescence, we
recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from 13 year-olds, 16 year-olds,
and young adults in a dichotic listening paradigm that included both linguistic and nonlinguistic probe stimuli. The results revealed a complex
developmental trajectory for selective auditory attention. The attentional
modulation of linguistic stimuli displayed a more linear path such that
the observed attention effect became more adult-like as age increased.
On the other hand, the attentional modulation of nonlinguistic probes
appeared to follow a non-linear course, such that during late adolescence
a more idiosyncratic profile was observed compared to earlier and later
stages of development. These findings suggest that distinct elements of
selective auditory attention are not mature even in late adolescence and
continue to develop into adulthood.

PERCEIVING TIME ACROSS A LIFETIME: THE EFFECTS OF TIME
PERCEPTION ON ATTENTION IN YOUNGER AND OLDER ADULTS Carson

Pun1, Tracey A Herlihey1, Susanne Ferber1; 1University of Toronto — We
all
experience the passage of time and this experience seems to change as
we get older. Interestingly, the perceived passage of time seems to influ86

ence cognition and also has clinical implications. For example, older
adults with faster time perception experience less clinical depression,
have an enhanced sense of purpose and a “younger” perceived age.
However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are still unclear. Some
researchers have attempted to study time perception by altering the
sense of time using cross modality stimuli (e.g., visual and auditory) or
by depleting working memory resources. Here we present a novel technique that can alter the perception of time using a purely visual manipulation. We took advantage of an established temporal replication
paradigm in which judgments of the passage of time are measured by
replicating a standard duration. We manipulated the display by presenting dots that moved in a circular pattern around a target stimulus at various speeds. Our results demonstrate that a simple visual manipulation
can indeed alter an observer’s sense of time: slow moving dots induced a
sense of time that was slower and fast moving dots induced a sense of
time that was faster. We also show how an altered perception of time can
influence attention: reaction times differed significantly on a basic reaction time task depending on the observer’s sense of the passage of time.
We explored these effects across younger and older adults to gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying time perception changes in
aging.

higher cognitive processes and attention allocation during multitasking
of cell phone conversations and driving. Behavioral results indicate that
hands-free cellular phone conversations cause statistically significant but
small reaction time effects (compared to no conversation) for braking
responses to visual events during simulated and on-road driving. The
validated Static Load driving paradigm gives rise to high correlations of
red light reaction times between lab and road. We used that paradigm
during ERP and fMRI brain imaging. Our results with subjects younger
than 65 confirm as expected that cellular conversations increase brain
activation in language and attention areas. The novel finding is that an
angry emotional tone improves behavioral reaction time performance
compared to a neutral tone; and at the same time, elicits the right frontoparietal networks and desynchronizes or dampens the left frontal activity. Preliminary results of subjects older than 65 showed significant
effects of conversation and emotion on performance measures in addition to reaction time (e.g., accuracy; central vs. peripheral positions of the
visual event). We conclude that an emotional speech tone provides a
processing advantage compared to neutral speech during hands-free
conversations while driving. The neural mechanism may be linked to an
early central negativity and later posterior positivity, or an enhanced
“readiness to respond” in central and posterior cortical regions linked to
attention. These findings could have prominent implications for automotive telecommunication designs.

Attention: Multisensory

MULTISENSORY DISTRACTION OR ENHANCEMENT: STIMULUS
PRESENTATION RATE DETERMINES THE NEURAL INTERACTION OF
IGNORED VISUAL STIMULATION Ulrike Zimmer1, Robin Mi1, Marty

Woldorff1; 1Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Duke University — Previous

studies have shown that the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) can
be modulated by focused auditory spatial attention, particularly when
the stimulus presentation is rapid. Adding a visual stimulus to an auditory, depending on the circumstances, can result in either multisensory
enhancement or suppression. Here, we asked if and how the stimulus
presentation rate might influence auditory MMNs in unisensory versus
multisensory attentional contexts. We utilized two auditory selective-

attention paradigms, differing only in the stimulus-onset-asynchronies
(SOAs) (120-320ms versus 240-640ms), that required subjects to attend to
one of two dichotically presented tone streams. Half of the sounds were
accompanied by a spatially and temporally aligned visual flash. Reaction
times were shorter for unisensory than multisensory conditions at fast
rates, but longer at slow ones. Correspondingly, in the unisensory conditions the MMN amplitude increased with attention in the fast but not the
slow paradigm, consistent with previous studies. Importantly, however,
multisensory MMNs were smaller than unisensory ones at fast rates, but
larger at slow ones. This pattern suggests that when sounds are presented rapidly and half of them are accompanied by a visual stimulus,
then the visual stimuli are temporally also so close together that they
form a strong template stream of their own, thus decreasing their ability
to capture auditory attention on individual events. In contrast, more
slowly presented visual stimuli are more clearly separated, allowing
residual auditory resources, which are greater at slow rates, to spread
and bind to the synchronously presented visual stimulus, resulting in
multisensory enhancement of processing.

ATTENTIONAL CUEING MODULATES PERCEIVED STIMULUS CONTRAST
AND EARLY CORTICAL PROCESSING Viola S. Störmer1, John J.

McDonald2, Steven A. Hillyard3; 1Max Planck Institute for Human
Development, Berlin, 2Simon Fraser University, 3University of California San
Diego — In a recent study we found that auditory cueing of attention can

boost the perceived contrast of subsequent visual objects by increasing
the signal strength in early visual pathways (Störmer, McDonald, Hillyard, 2009). Previous psychophysical studies had demonstrated that
visual cueing of attention can also increase apparent stimulus contrast
(Carrasco, Ling, Read, 2004). To determine whether this unimodal cueing effect of attention similarly arises from early sensory enhancement,
we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants judged
the relative contrast of two Gabor patches (2º × 2º; 4cpd) presented to the
left and right visual fields following an unpredictive lateralized visual
cue (black dot; cf. Carrasco et al. 2004). Visual cueing of attention
increased the perceived stimulus contrast and was accompanied by an
enhanced positivity over the occipital scalp contralateral to the visual
cue beginning 140ms after target onset, similar to our findings with
cross-modal cueing of attention. To investigate the mechanism of this
exogenous attentional cueing effect, we examined the ERPs in the cuetarget interval on trials in which no target stimulus occurred (30% of trials). An enhanced positive deflection was found over the occipital scalp
contralateral to the cue starting at about 200ms after cue onset and lasting for about 250ms. This occipital positivity was also found even when
the initial cue was auditory. We conclude that the exogenous cueing of
attention increases the neural response in early visual pathways, thereby
preparing the perceptual processing of possible subsequent targets at
that location.

MUSIC ENHANCES VISUOSPATIAL WORKING MEMORY IN WOMEN BUT
NOT MEN Julia Mossbridge1, Marcia Grabowecky1, Satoru Suzuki1;
1Northwestern University — Many

people listen to music while performing
tasks requiring working memory (WM), but it is not clear how simultaneous music affects WM performance. There is disputed evidence from
other laboratories that music helps performance on visual WM tasks
such as remembering the identity of objects, while music may hurt verbal WM tasks such as remembering letters and words. In the present
study, in each trial of a dual 1-back task, 32 subjects (16 female) had to
remember both the position (one of four possible locations) and identity
of an abstract, non-verbalizable image and respond when the position or
identity of this image, or both, matched that on the previous trial. These
subjects also performed a verbal version of the task with pronounceable
nonsense words instead of images. Women were significantly more
accurate on the visual WM task while listening to instrumental music as
compared to no music whereas men’s accuracy trended toward worsening with music. Music had no effect on accuracy in the verbal WM task.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

In a second experiment, the same protocol was repeated (n=32, 16
females), except that a looped recording of a baby crying was used in
place of music. Performance was not affected by the presence of the
baby-crying sound, suggesting that music itself, not just any auditory
stimulus, preferentially assists female visuospatial WM performance.
The mechanism underlying this effect is currently under investigation.
In summary, it appears that some sounds can facilitate visuospatial WM,
especially among women.

and internally-directed cognition within the human default mode network (DMN) remains largely unknown. Here we use intracranial recordings in the human posteromedial cortex (PMC), a core node within the
DMN, during conditions of cued rest, autobiographical judgments, and
arithmetic processing. We found a heterogeneous profile of PMC
responses in functional, spatial, and temporal domains. While the majority of PMC sites showed increased broad gamma band activity (30-180
Hz) during rest, some PMC sites, proximal to the retrosplenial cortex,
responded selectively to autobiographical stimuli. However, no site
responded to both conditions even though they were located within the
boundaries of the DMN identified with resting-state functional imaging
and similarly deactivated during arithmetic processing. These findings,
which provide novel electrophysiological evidence for heterogeneity
within the core of the DMN, will have important implications for neuroimaging studies of the DMN.

INTERNAL VERSUS EXTERNAL BODY-FOCUSED ATTENTION HAVE
OPPOSITE EFFECTS ON SOMATOSENSORY PERCEPTUAL DECISIONMAKING Laura Mirams1, Ellen Poliakoff1, Richard J Brown1, Donna M

Lloyd1; 1The University of Manchester — Although ‘body-focused attention’

is thought to affect somatic perception, the concept is not always well
defined and different types of body-focused attention may have opposing effects. The current research investigated the effects of interoceptive
and exteroceptive body-focused attention on somatic perception using
the somatic signal detection task (SSDT). Healthy participants often erroneously report near-threshold vibrations presented to their fingertip in
the absence of a stimulus on this task, particularly when a nearby light
flashes. In experiment one, thirty-seven participants completed the SSDT
without and after performing an interoceptive heart beat perception
(HBP) task. The HBP task was expected to raise levels of sensory noise
during the SSDT, leading to increased touch reports due to confusion
between internal bodily sensations and the target vibration. The HBP
task led to a more liberal response criterion, due to increased touch
reports both in the presence and absence of a target vibration. This finding is consistent with suggestions that attending internally contributes to
symptom reporting in patients with medically unexplained symptoms.
In experiment two, forty participants completed the SSDT before and
after an exteroceptive grating orientation task (GOT). The GOT task was
expected to reduce touch reports by decreasing sensory noise. The GOT
led to a more stringent response criterion, due to decreased touch reports
in the presence and absence of the target. This work demonstrates that
internal and external body-focused attention can have opposite effects

TEMPORAL DURATION JUDGEMENTS: EFFECTS OF MODALITY, LOCATION
SHIFT AND ATTENTION Chrysa Retsa1, Tristan Bekinschtein2, Thomas Bak1;
1University

of Edinburgh,

2Cognition

and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge —

Temporal perception can be affected by several factors such as attention,
modality and spatial position. Recent studies reported an overestimation
of the duration of stimuli presented on the right side and underestimation of those presented on the left. We conducted a series of experiments
to investigate the effects of modality and location on duration judgments. Participants were presented with a standard stimulus followed
by a comparison stimulus and were asked to indicate whether the comparison stimulus was longer or shorter than the standard. Comparison
stimuli were presented either on the same or different location than the
standard. We varied the position (left/right, top/bottom) across visual
and auditory modalities. Visual and auditory trials were presented separately as well as intermixed. Across all experiments we found no effect of
location (left versus right, top versus bottom). However, in the experiments where different modality trials were intermixed, in visual condition participants were overestimating the durations when comparison
stimuli were presented at different locations to the standard. In the conditions where the location of the comparison was different to the standard, visual stimuli were judged to be longer than the auditory.
However, when the location of the comparison stimulus was at the same
side as the standard a reverse effect was observed. These findings call
into question a static influence of the position per se on temporal judgments. Instead, the effects of position could be accounted for by a shift of
spatial attention between two locations and by peri-saccadic effects such
as chronostasis.

INTERMODAL ATTENTION BIASES MULTISENSORY INTERACTIONS IN THE
Karns1,
VISUAL AND TACTILE PERIPHERY: AN FMRI STUDY Christina

Mark Dow1, Jolinda Smith1, Scott Frey1, Helen Neville1; 1University of
Oregon — Intermodal attention may enhance neural processing relatively

early in the sensory stream independently of spatial and selective-attention (Karns & Knight 2009), therefore we hypothesized that intermodal
attention also biases multisensory interactions. We employed fMRI to
determine the degree to which coregistered vision and touch interact
and to characterize mechanisms of intersensory attentional selection for
unisensory and multisensory stimuli. Weak lights and air-puffs were
coregistered in far-peripheral visual space, ~45° above or below the right
eye, to elicit robust multisensory interactions. In a whole brain analysis,
we modeled the effects of visual stimuli, tactile stimuli, and super- and
subadditive interactions relative to embedded rest blocks. Among taskpositive regions with a robust BOLD response to visual stimulation, two
areas were superadditive with visual attention to multisensory stimuli:
the contralateral lateral occipital complex (LOC) -- overlapping with
motion sensitive regions (V5/MT+) and extending into the posterior
fusiform -- and the superior parietal gyrus. Task-positive regions more
responsive in tactile blocks included the posterior and middle insula,
supramarginal gyrus, parietal operculum, precentral sulcus, and inferior
central sulcus (BA6). Weak BOLD increases in the middle insula were
superadditive and only with tactile attention. In task-negative regions of
the ipsilateral intraparietal sulcus, inferior postcentral sulcus, occipital
pole, and anterior calcarine sulcus, multisensory blocks were more negative than their unisensory counterparts. Overall, the results are consistent with an intermodal selection mechanism that operates in sensory
cortices and influences multisensory interactions: with intermodal selection, multisensory-interactions are shifted to brain regions biased toward
the attended sensory modality.

IS ATTENTION TO THE BODY ABNORMAL IN PEOPLE WITH UNEXPLAINED
SYMPTOMS? AN INVESTIGATION USING THE MODALITY SHIFT EFFECT
PARADIGM Eleanor Miles1, Richard J Brown2, Ellen Poliakoff2; 1University
of Sheffield, UK, 2University of Manchester, UK — It has often been assumed

that people with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) have an attentional bias for the body, which leads them to amplify normal physical
sensations and experience them as symptoms. However, this conclusion
is largely based on self-report measures of attention. Experimental investigations have the benefit of providing more direct evidence for an attentional bias, and can also provide more specific evidence about the nature
of the bias. The current study applied an experimental paradigm from
the attention literature (the modality shift effect; cf. Spence, Nicholls &
Driver, 2001) to an analogue MUS group and a control group, in order to
investigate whether symptom experience was associated with a deficit in
the ability to shift between touch and vision. Both groups showed a relative RT benefit when the same modality was repeated across two trials
(and a relative cost when the modality switched), and this effect
decreased over time after target presentation. However, the analogue
MUS group showed a longer-lasting benefit when the tactile modality
was repeated. This might imply that impaired disengagement from tactile stimuli is the key attentional process contributing to symptom experience. Future research should take into account the possibility that
attentional deficits in MUS are more complex than simply attending
towards the body.

There is growing evidence that spatial attention and visual awareness
are distinct and independent processes. However, spatial location may
not be an intrinsic component of the content of awareness, in the sense
that one may be aware of an object without knowing precisely where this
object is located. Attention to intrinsic features of an object, such as shape
or color, might be much more relevant because those features determine
the content of awareness. We therefore designed an experiment in which
we manipulated simultaneously attention to color and awareness. Color
cues indicated, on each trial, the most likely color of the upcoming stimulus. On top of the color target, a faint grating, at threshold for conscious
detection, was presented. Physically identical stimuli could therefore be
attended or not and consciously seen or not. We observed typical attentional effect, with a shortening of reaction times for attended targets in
the aware condition. However, magneto-encephalographic data results
revealed distinct and independent neural correlates for visual awareness
and feature-based attention. Attention to color modulated event-related
fields around 220ms, and this attentional modulation was present for
both consciously seen and unseen stimuli. Stimuli that were later
reported as consciously seen elicited larger responses between 260 and
300ms than undetected stimuli. Our results therefore suggest that feature-based attention can operate on neural activity independently from
awareness, and conversely that there can be neural correlates of awareness independently from feature-based attention. These results strongly
support the idea that attention and awareness correspond to two distinct
neural mechanisms.

AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE OF RAPID ATTENTIONAL
CAPTURE BY BIOLOGICAL MOTION Laura Chubb1, James Thompson1,
Craig McDonald1; 1George Mason University — Recent work provides evi-

dence of top-down attentional influences in the processing of biological
motion. However, bottom-up, salience-based attentional processing may
also play a role in certain contexts. To test this possibility, we recorded
event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants performed a variant of
the three-stimulus oddball task. Participants were probed with taskirrelevant point light walker (PLW) and scrambled point light walker
(sPLW) stimuli in the context of a target detection task. The PLW and
sPLW served as probes in separate blocks. Common and target stimuli
were various forms of tool motion. We found that the PLW elicited a significantly larger occipital P1 component than did the sPLW. This effect
was localized to the right hemisphere. The N1 component elicited by the
PLW was also significantly larger in the right hemisphere. In addition,
we found a significant hemisphere by stimulus interaction for the P3a
component. However, this right-lateralized increase in amplitude only
approached significance. Importantly, the P1, N1 and P3 components
elicited by target stimuli did not differ in amplitude between PLW and
sPLW blocks. Our findings provide electrophysiological evidence of
rapid (<150 ms), involuntary attentional capture by biological motion.

Schoenfeld1,2,3; 1Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, 2Leibniz-Institute
for Neurobiology Magdeburg, 3Kliniken Schmieder Allensbach — Attentional
selection on the basis of non-spatial stimulus features produces a sensory
gain enhancement by increasing the firing-rate of individual neurons
tuned to the attended feature, while responses of neurons tuned to opposite feature-values are suppressed. Here we recorded event-related
potentials (ERP) and event-related magnetic fields (ERF) in human
observers to investigate analogous neural correlates of global featurebased attention at the population level. During the task subjects attended
to the direction of a moving transparent surface located in the left visual
field, while in the right visual field a second transparent surface moved
briefly into varying directions. The direction of these movements deviated from the motion-direction of the attended surface by 0°, 45°, 90°,
135° or 180° and were completely irrelevant for the task. The spatiotemporal analysis revealed that the neural activity elicited by these probe
stimuli was localized to the contralateral motion-sensitive area human
MT and was parametrically modulated as a function of the similarity
between their motion-direction and the direction of the attended surface.
These results provide strong support for the “feature-similarity gain”
hypothesis by showing that the feature-based attention related multiplicative scaling of single-neuron activity converges into an enhanced
direction-selective response at neural population level.

NEURAL BASES OF ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF FOCUS OF ATTENTION:
AN FMRI STUDY ON UNPREDICTABILITY Chandramallika Basak1, Cris

Hamilton1, Yu-Hsuan Chang1, Debshila Basu Mallick1; 1Rice University — In
addition to accessing and updating information (Oberauer, 2003), focus
of attention (FoA) has been proposed to direct attention to the relevant
informational unit (Basak & Verhaeghen, in press). (Un)predictability of
stimulus occurrence in the sequence determines whether focus switching
cost, the process of switching information in and out of FoA, is constant
or increases with working memory load (N); the latter is indicative of
controlled search process outside the FoA. In the current study, we
manipulated the stimulus predictability across blocks for N>2, with the
rest of the parameters remaining constant, in a new continuous memoryupdating paradigm (N varied from 1 to 3). In the predictable sequence,
e.g. 2-pred, the sequences appeared in a known sequence whereas in the
unpredictable sequence, e.g. 2-unp, the stimulus appearance was ran-

dom. The main goal was to determine the neural substrate of pointer
unpredictability in FoA (i.e., unp>pred contrast). For this contrast, we
found significant activations in hippocampus, left insula and post-central gyrus. In addition, there was significant predictability (pred, unp) by
set-size (N=2, N=3) interaction for hippocampus/ para hippocampus
gyrus (PHG), left insula and middle frontal gyrus. In accordance to previous researchers, we found increased significant activations for items in
FoA, compared to outside FoA, in the frontal pole, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus and insula (Oztekin et al., 2010; Osaka et al., 2007;
Nee and Jonides, 2008). These findings suggest that the neural substrates
of controlled search induced by pointer unpredictability are based on
hippocampus, fronto-insula network.

ATTENTION CAPTURE MODULATES THE ATTENTIONAL BLINK Simon

Nielsen1, Tobias Andersen1; 1Technical University of Denmark, Richard
Petersens Plads, Lyngby, Denmark — When two targets (T1 & T2) are presented in rapid succession, observers often fail to report T2 if they attend
to T1. Bottleneck theories propose that this attentional blink (AB) is due
to T1 occupying a slow processing stage when T2 is presented. Accordingly, if increasing T1 difficulty increases T1 processing time, this should
cause a greater AB. Attention capture hypotheses suggest that T1 captures attention, which cannot be reallocated to T2 in time. Accordingly, if
increasing T1 difficulty, decreases T1 saliency, this should cause a
smaller AB. Studies examining how T1 difficulty affects the AB have
reported inconsistent results. For example, some found a negative correlation between T1 contrast and T2 performance (Chua, 2005) where others find a positive correlation (Christmann & Leuthold, 2004). Here, we
use additive Gaussian noise to tease apart the exogenous capture effect
from the effect of T1 contrast. The capture effect is varied by the overall
contrast energy for signal and noise. In two T1 conditions we adjust T1
performance to 60% by signal to noise ratio (SNR). However, we vary T1
contrast energy by between conditions by approximately a factor 10.
From 17 observers we find that T2 performance correlates negatively
with T1 contrast energy. Our results indicate that T1 capture modulates
the AB. We suggest that this effect has confounded previous studies on
the effect of T1 difficulty. In an electrophysiological version of the study
we will further examine the implied relation between attention capture
and the AB.

PUPILLOMETRY AND P3 INDEX THE LOCUS COERULEUSNORADRENERGIC AROUSAL FUNCTION IN HUMANS Peter R. Murphy1,

Ian H. Robertson1, Joshua H. Balsters1, Redmond G. O'Connell1; 1Trinity
College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland —
The adaptive gain theory (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005) has recently highlighted the pivotal role of the brain’s locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LCNE) neuromodulatory system in regulating task engagement and optimizing performance according to environmental contingencies. Understanding of the functional dynamics of LC-NE activity in humans has
been hampered, however, by an absence of reliable and easy-to-acquire
neurophysiological markers that have sufficient temporal resolution to
index the tonic and phasic shifts that are observed to occur within this
system. The present study evaluated the utility of two candidate psychophysiological markers of the LC-NE system: the P3 event-related potential (ERP) and pupil diameter. Twenty-four participants completed a 37minute auditory oddball task concurrent to both pupillometry and EEG
data collection. As predicted by the adaptive gain theory, pre-stimulus
pupil diameter exhibited a significant inverted-U shaped relationship
with both P3 amplitude and task performance such that largest P3
amplitudes and optimal performance occurred at the same intermediate
level of pre-stimulus pupil diameter. Large phasic pupil dilations, by
contrast, were elicited during periods of poor performance and were followed by re-engagement in the task and increased P3 amplitudes. These
results support recent proposals that pre-stimulus pupil diameter and
the P3 are sensitive to LC-NE mode. We further argue that the large pha-

sic pupil dilations we observed may reflect phasic LC responses driven
by higher-cortical performance-monitoring mechanisms.

ENHANCEMENT AND SUPPRESSION IN ATTENTIONAL SELECTION OF

Hillyard1, Matthias M. Müller2; 1University of California in San Diego (UCSD),
2
University of Leipzig, Germany, 3University of Aberdeen, UK — In a series of

experiments, attentional selection of features was assessed by recording
steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to multiple concurrently
presented random dot stimuli together with behavioral data. Voluntary
cued shifts of feature-selective attention to one of two spatially overlapping stimuli were marked by both to an enhancement of the attended as
well as a suppression of the unattended stimulus. Interestingly, the
enhancement of the attended stimulus preceded the suppression of the
unattended stimulus by some 130ms. Analysis of single trial amplitudes
revealed that this pattern of results can possibly be explained by the
combined effects of a sensory gain mechanism biasing the competition
between the overlapping stimuli, which then leads to a suppression of
the unattended stimulus. Additionally, the time-course of SSVEP amplitudes was found to be closely related to reaction times. To examine possible interactions of bottom-up biases and top-down stimulus selection
on stimulus processing, in a further experiment stimulus contrast was
manipulated in order to produce a bottom-up bias towards one or the
other stimulus. Both voluntary attention and higher stimulus contrast
lead to higher SSVEP amplitudes. The absolute size of the attention effect
increased with higher contrast, however the relative attentional enhancement remained constant. Hence, even when stimuli are presented overlapping and thus directly compete for processing resources, both
bottom-up and top-down factors independently influence signal gain at
early levels of visual processing.

C39
RESOURCE SHARING CANNOT EXPLAIN THE ATTENTIONAL BLINK
Hannah Pincham1, Denes Szucs1; 1University of Cambridge — The attentional

blink refers to a deficit in processing the second of two masked targets
(T1 and T2) presented in rapid serial visual presentation. Considerable
debate questions whether cognitive resource sharing underpins the
attentional blink. Increasing the resources allocated to T1 may reduce the
resources available for T2 processing, causing T2 to go undetected. We
systematically investigated this claim by manipulating the difficulty of
T2 detection. Specifically, the T2 mask enabled T2 detection on approximately half of the experimental trials. We used the electroencephalography P3 component to index the resources allocated to each target. If the
resource sharing account holds, the T1 P3 should be reduced on T2detected trials versus T2-undetected trials. 24 healthy adult participants
completed an alphanumeric attentional blink task. The lag between T1
and T2 was set at three items to ensure that T2 fell within the ‘blink’
period. The targets were masked with a computer symbol such that T2
was accurately detected on approximately 50% of trials. Participants also
indicated their confidence levels using a ranking scale. The results indicated that the peak latency and amplitude of the T1 P3 did not differ as a
function of T2 accuracy. Not surprisingly, however, the amplitude of the
T2 P3 was significantly reduced on T2-undetected trials. Therefore, even
though resource sharing may play a role in the attentional blink deficit,
these results suggest that resource sharing should not be viewed as the
primary contributing factor.

EXPLORING THE NEUROCHEMICAL BASIS OF THE P300: EVIDENCE OF
DOPAMINERGIC AND NORADRENERGIC INFLUENCE Redmond

Ian Robertson1, Mark Bellgrove2; 1Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience,
Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland, 2School of Psychology and
Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland,
Australia — The P300 has been one of the most extensively studied eventrelated potentials (ERP) and has demonstrated strong sensitivity to

90

aspects of attention and memory. Despite the large amount of interest in
this component as a clinical and neuro-cognitive marker its neurochemical origins remain poorly understood, limiting its potential utility. The
present study explored the effects of three monamine (dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin) agents on P300 amplitude. Twenty-five healthy
participants entered a randomised, cross-over controlled trial in which
they received a single dose of methylphenidate (a noradrenaline and
dopamine re-uptake inhibitor), atomoxetine (a noradrenaline re-uptake
inhibitor), citalopram (a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) or placebo before
each of four testing sessions, one-week apart. EEG data were acquired
while participants performed two versions of the visual oddball paradigm: a two-stimulus version designed to elicit the P3b target-detection
component and a three-stimulus version designed to elicit the P3a distracter-processing component. Relative to placebo, methylphenidate and
atomoxetine led to significant improvement in RT and RT variability and
increased P3b amplitude over centro-parietal scalp sites on the two-stimulus task. On the three-stimulus task, only methylphenidate had a significant effect, leading to improved target detection and decreased reaction
time in addition to a significant increase in P3a amplitude over frontocentral scalp sites. No significant behavioural or electrophysiological
effects were observed for citalopram with either task. Our data provide
clear support for the role of catecholamines in generating the P300 and
suggest that the P3a and P3b components are differentially sensitive to
changes in dopamine and noradrenaline.

WHAT'S IN A PICTURE: COLOR CUES EMBEDDED IN COMPLEX VISUAL
SCENES ATTRACT ATTENTION E. Menton McGinnis1, Andreas Keil1;
1University of Florida — Affectively

relevant objects attract attention and
enhance perception. What remains unknown is what kind of features in
emotional stimuli attract resources and how. Here, we examined cueing
versus interference of color cues embedded in naturalistic picture stimuli. Effects of affective color cues on cortical processing of a concurrent
color stimulus were examined by means of frequency tagging as
afforded by steady-state visually evoked brain potentials (ssVEPs). Participants viewed a series of images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), modified such that the top 5% of the red pixels in the
mutilation images were standardized across all images, and were
replaced by red or green pixel values in otherwise gray-scale images.
Cueing effects were examined by either a 14 Hz frame (Experiment 1) or
by an embedded 15 Hz central foveal probe (Experiment 2), flickering in
either red or green. In both experiments, viewing affective pictures was
associated with suppressed ssVEP amplitude, suggesting arousing
images compete for resources in matched cue/probe conditions, irrespective of color. Green probe conditions produced an enhanced ssVEP
in affective images irrespective of cue color, also consistent between
experiments. Additionally, red cues produced enhanced ssVEP amplitude in arousing images, suggesting the context-appropriate red cue in
mutilation images resulted in facilitation of the emotionally salient feature, irrespective of probe color. These findings suggest affective stimuli

within affective stimuli, context-appropriate color cueing is beneficial.

DISSOCIATING FORMS OF ATTENTIONAL CONTROL USING THE
DISTRACTOR CONDITION SUSTAINED ATTENTION TASK: PATIENTS WITH
SCHIZOPHRENIA VERSUS CHILDREN Elise Demeter1, Sally Guthrie1,

Stephan Taylor1, Martin Sarter1, Cindy Lustig1; 1University of Michigan —
Attentional deficits represent a core cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, persisting across both periods of psychosis and remission (e.g.,
Wohlberg and Kornetsky, 1973). The distractor condition sustained
attention task (dSAT) can be used to assess attention in both rodents and
humans. Because of the dSAT’s translational potential, the Cognitive
Neuroscience Treatment to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia
(CNTRICS) initiative selected it as a candidate tool for measuring attentional control deficits in schizophrenia (Nuechterlein et al., 2009). The
paradigm compares performance in the standard sustained attention

task (SAT) versus a condition with a distracting flashing background
(dSAT). In the present study, the SAT and dSAT were performed by
patients with schizophrenia and age- and gender-matched controls. To
address concerns about ceiling performance in the SAT by the original
control group, two additional control groups were tested. The first consisted of school-age children, who are also thought to have reduced
attentional control compared to healthy adults. The second was another
group of adult controls tested under conditions that increased uncertainty about signal duration and location. Patients with schizophrenia
showed only small impairments on the SAT but were differentially
impaired by the distractor (dSAT) compared to the other groups. Children were the only group to show time-on-task effects on the basic SAT.
These results demonstrate the feasibility of using the dSAT with schizophrenic patients, and suggest that their distraction-related impairments
can be dissociated from general performance impairments and from the
performance of other groups (i.e., children) for whom reduced attentional control arises for different reasons.

DISTRACTION VERSUS DETECTION: EVIDENCE FOR DIFFERENTIALLYLATERALIZED FRONTOPARIETAL CONTROL PROCESSES FROM THE
DISTRACTOR CONDITION SUSTAINED ATTENTION TASK Anne
Berry1,

Elise Demeter1, Mary Askren1, Martin Sarter1, Cindy Lustig1; 1University of
Michigan — Sustained attentional performance requires both the longterm maintenance of top-down control to keep attention on the task, and
moment-by-moment attentional shifts to detect and respond to relevant
signals. The sustained attention task (SAT) and its distractor condition
(dSAT) were originally developed to investigate attentional mechanisms
in rodents. It has been validated for human use (Demeter et al., 2008),
and selected by the CNTRICS (Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia) initiative as a candidate measure of attentional control (Nuechterlein et al., 2009). A recent
block-design study (Demeter et al., 2010) found that right middle frontal
gyrus activity selectively increased in response to the distractor. Here we
report an event-related fMRI study of SAT and dSAT trials in healthy
young adults. On each trial, participants monitored for a brief, centrallypresented signal, indicating its presence or absence in a subsequent
response period. During dSAT trials, the background screen flickered,
impairing performance. Consistent with previous studies of top-down
attention, performance of SAT and dSAT activated frontoparietal control
networks. However, while the distraction contrast (dSAT vs SAT)
revealed right prefrontal activation, consistent with our previous findings, a contrast of hits (correct signal trials) versus correct rejections (correct nonsignal trials) revealed prefrontal and parietal activations that
were largely left-lateralized. Future analysis will include trial-type and
trial sequence effects to further examine potential links between fMRI
activation measures in humans and neurotransmitter release patterns in
animal models.

group (RG1) (n=22) compared to a matched wait-list control group (CG)
(n=22), which later underwent its own 3-month retreat (RG2). Training
consisted of focused attention techniques (4-6 hrs/d) and practices of
generating beneficial emotions (0.5-1.5 hr/d) (Wallace, 2006). 88-channel
EEG was obtained pre-, mid-, and post-retreat while participants rested

attention meditation (6-min of mindfulness of breathing). Second-order

blind source separation was used for removal of putative non-neural signals. Individual mean alpha frequency (IAF) was calculated during rest
and was used to determine EEG bands for each participant. Significant
reduction in IAF was found at mid and post test-points in both RGs but
not the CG. Changes in scalp current density spectral power across testpoints were assessed using nonparametric cluster-based analysis. During meditation (for both RGs) reduction in beta power was found bilaterally over parieto-occipital and midline fronto-central areas at mid and
post test-points compared with the pre test-point. During pre-meditation
rest reduced alpha and beta power was found at frontal, central and
parieto-occipital areas in both RGs at mid and post test-points. Further,
pre-to-post reduction in upper alpha band power during the pre-meditation rest predicted improved performance in a sustained attention task
(RG2) (MacLean et al 2010). These results suggest that training in
focused attention increases activation of attention-related systems during meditation. These effects appear to generalize to non-meditation
periods and may underlie observed improvements in tasks that require
sustained attention.

Psychology of the Catholic University, Milan, Italy — Patients with right hemisphere lesions and visual neglect fail to orient and respond to left-sided
objects. There is general agreement that neglect is a heterogenous, multicomponential syndrome, but the location and identity of the relevant
lesion sites remain debated. Twenty-five right-handed patients with subacute strokes in the right hemisphere performed a paper-and-pencil
neglect battery. Their performance (scores on each individual neglect
test) was mapped to cortical lesions by using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) method. The principal white matter (WM) association bundles were reconstructed by using diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) tractography. DTI-derived metrics of WM integrity for each tract
(fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and radial and parallel diffusivities) were also obtained. Distinct cortical regions including the right
angular and supramarginal gyri, as well as the middle frontal gyrus
were specifically associated with deficits obtained on specific tests.
VLSM and tractography both revealed that damage to the right anterior
segment of the arcuate fasciculus, connecting Broca’s territory with the
inferior parietal lobe, correlated with pathological scores in all the tests
used. These results indicate an essential role of the WM damage in
neglect and open the way for an interpretation of performance dissociations in neglect on the basis of WM bundles disconnections.

that eventually maps the symbolic quantity of the set onto a specific
number. However, the role of these mechanisms in quantity estimation
has typically been studied in isolation. In the present study we assessed
the contribution of the individuation and VWM mechanisms in visual
estimation by using a novel approach based on the N2pc and CDA, two
Event-Related Potential (ERP) measures of visual selection and VWM
maintenance, respectively. Participants saw a variable number (1, 3, 5, 7)
of lateralized,uniquely colored targets presented among distracters, and
their task was to report the number of targets. Results showed that the
N2pc amplitudes increased as a function of target numerosity, reaching
an asymptote at approximately 5 elements, in line with the capacity limit
proposed by some models of individuation. CDA amplitudes showed a
peculiar inverted U-shape pattern, with a marked decrease in activation
for the largest numerosity in the set, in line with previous research showing a predominant guessing strategy in the so-called end effect. Overall,
the present results indicate that the individuation and VWM mechanisms jointly contribute to visual estimation of small quantities.

THE INFLUENCE OF REWARD ON COMPETITION BASED ATTENTION AND
ITS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES Jessica Sänger1, Edmund
Wascher2; 1Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, 2Leibniz Research Centre for
biased
competition
Working Environment and Human Factors — The

approach on visuo-spatial attention proposes that the selection of competing information is effected by the saliency of the stimulus as well as
by an intention- based bias of attention towards behavioural goals.
Wascher & Beste (2010) could show that the detection of relevant information depends on its relative saliency compared to irrelevant conflicting stimuli. Furthermore the N1pc, N2pc and N2 of the EEG varied with
the strength of the conflict. However, this system should also be modulated by rather global mechanisms like attentional effort. The present
study investigates such modulations by testing the influence of the
reward system on the selection of competing stimuli. Participants had to
detect a luminance change in various conditions among others against
an irrelevant orientation change. Half of the participants were motivated
to maximize their performance by announcing a monetary reward for
correct responses. Participants who got rewarded had lower error rates
than participants who got no reward. The event-related lateralizations of
the EEG showed no reward-related effect on the N1pc, which reflects the
initial saliency driven orientation of attention towards the more salient
stimulus. The subsequent N2pc was enhanced in the reward condition.
Reward was also accompanied by an enhanced fronto-central N2. Thus,
the data provide evidence that the improvement of selection performance when giving a reward was not due to changes in the initial
saliency based processing of information but was foremost mediated by
improved higher-level mechanisms.

ENHANCED CORTICAL ORIENTING RESPONSE TO NOVELTY IN
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER Norbert
Kathmann1,
Moritz

Ischebeck1, Tanja Endrass1; 1Humboldt University at Berlin — Experimental
research in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has shown that OCD
patients perform abnormally in some attentional tasks. We hypothesized
that a hypersensitive threat detection system in OCD patients evokes
increased cortical orienting responses reflected in enhanced novelty P3
(NP3) amplitudes of the event-related brain potential (ERP). Novel pictures which were task-irrelevant but had either neutral or negative affective valence were presented among frequent standards and rare targets.
As expected, aversive novels elicited larger NP3 amplitudes than neutral
novels across groups. OCD patients had increased NP3 amplitudes compared to healthy control probands after novel stimuli, but not after targets. Moreover, affective valence had no effect on group differences. This
pattern was confirmed in a replication study. In a further experiment we
studied auditory novelty responses during a memory task in which in
context A only neutral and in context B mixed (neutral and aversive) pictures were memorized, in order to evaluate the effect of affective context.
Here, enhanced auditory NP3 amplitudes were found primarily in the
92

neutral condition. It is concluded that novel events elicit larger ERP
responses in OCD patients than in controls probably indicating augmented involuntary shifts of attention to infrequent irrelevant events.
This abnormally high cortical orienting response is independent from
the affective significance of event or context, and may constitute an
endophenotype of OCD which can be helpful in the search for the
genetic basis of the disorder.

State University — We examined the effect of strategy on neural recruitment during video game play. Fifty participants completed 30 hours of
training under one of two training regimes: Fixed Emphasis Training
(FET), in which participants practiced all the aspects of the Space Fortress (SF) game at once or, Hybrid Variable Priority Training (HVT), in
which participants practiced while prioritizing selective aspects of game
play at different times. After 30 hours of training, data indicated a significant advantage for the two training groups relative to a no-training control group. Following training, both groups showed reduced activation
in cortical areas involved in attentional control, namely the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and parietal cortices. The
control group continued to show activation in these areas post-training,
suggesting that the attentional demands of the task were not reduced for
control participant but were reduced for trained participants. In contrast,
areas of the default-mode network showed an increase in activation
post-training in the training groups. Initially poor performers improved
more with HVT than FET, and those receiving HVT also showed a
greater reduction in the activity of prefrontal and parietal regions. Training strategy did not produce differences in activation magnitude of initially high performing participants. These data suggest that training
reduced the attentional demands of SF, and this reduction was most evident in the HVT training group.

De Maio2,3, Sarah Raskin1; 1Trinity College, 2Institute of Living (IOL), 3Hartford
Hospital — Research has suggested that computer assisted Cognitive

Rehabilitation (CR) can produce significant improvement in daily functioning for people with schizophrenia. The goal of this research is to
examine performance on a simultaneous attention task used as part of a
CR training program and determine which variables predict improvement in training. Specifically, we analyzed two measures. The first is
improvement, defined as the difference between the first goal set in
treatment and the highest goal attained. The second measure was just
the highest goal reached on the CR task. These were compared to two
predictor variables: symptomatology (Positive and Negative Syndrome
Scale (PANSS)) and cognitive pre-tests (Brief Test of Attention (BTA),
Penn Continuous Performance Task (PCPT), Digit Span and Trails A &
B). Preliminary results showed that reaction time on the PCPT is significantly correlated with total improvement in CR. In Trails A, a measure of
attention and speed of processing, time predicts the highest goal that
will be attained. Most notably the BTA, a measure of auditory divided
attention, predicted total improvement. The data from PANSS negative
scale revealed a correlation with improvement for the passive/apathetic
social withdrawal measure. Based on the results, it appears that specific
baseline cognitive abilities measuring attention may be useful in predicting success as well one aspect of negative symptomatology. Therefore,
we may be able to predict who will most benefit from CR.

DO DIFFERENT PERCEPTUAL TASK SETS MODULATE SUBSEQUENT
UNCONSCIOUS MASKED VISUO-MOTOR PRIMING? ATTENTION TO
SHAPES AND COLORS PUT TO THE TEST Monika Zovko1, Markus Kiefer1;
1University of Ulm, Germany — According

to classical theories of automaticity and attention unconscious automatic processes are insusceptible to
higher level attentional influences such as intentions and task sets.
Recent evidence, however, shows that the cognitive system has to be
configured in a certain way for automatic processes to occur. Our attentional sensitization model (Martens & Kiefer, 2010) suggests that automatic processes require an attentional enhancement in task-relevant
pathways: Automatic processes can only be initiated if the process-relevant stimulus dimension matches the active attentional set. The present
event-related potential (ERP) study investigated whether unconscious
visuo-motor priming depends on a sensitization of processing pathways
for shape in contrast to color. Prior to the masked visuo-motor priming
task, a shape or a color decision task was presented in order to induce
corresponding attentional sets. In the masked visuo-motor priming task,
participants had to respond according to the shape of a visible target
object, which was preceded by either a response-congruent or incongruent masked prime shape. ERP data should clear influences of the induction tasks on subsequent masked visuo-motor priming effects. We found
priming effects over occipito-parietal regions only subsequent to the
shape induction task in early (140-240 ms) and late time windows (350500 ms). No such effects were found in the color induction task. The
results strongly support our notion of a differential attentional sensitization of unconscious processing pathways: As a function of an attentional
top-down signal, sensitization can also occur within perceptual subdomains, such as shape and color of objects.

RESILIENCE OF AUDITORY CHANGE DETECTION AGAINST MIND
WANDERING Julia W. Y. Kam1, Maria Stanciulescu1, Hamish Tildesley2,
Todd C. Handy1; 1University of British Columbia, 2Dartmouth College — The

propensity of the human mind to wander is evident in our everyday life,
as our thoughts frequently drift off-task. Despite the ubiquity of mind
wandering however, little is known about its influence on cognition
itself. While recent evidence suggests sensory and cognitive processing
of external stimuli are reduced during mind wandering states (Kam et
al., 2010), whether ongoing cognitive processes are directly modulated
by mind wandering are currently unknown. To address this issue we
examined the influence of task-related attention on auditory change
detection. The mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP component elicited
by deviant stimuli, serves as an index of change detection. In this study,
participants were presented a stream of auditory stimuli with deviant
tones embedded among standard tones, which they were instructed to
ignore, while they read a book. Occasionally, they were asked to report
on their attentional state--on task or mind wandering. The MMNs immediately preceding these subjective reports were then examined as a function of whether participants were in an “on-task” or “mind wandering”
state. Difference waveforms were obtained by subtracting ERP responses
to standard tones from that to deviant tones separately for both on-task
and mind wandering conditions. The MMN of the difference wave elicited during mind wandering states was significantly greater than the
MMN elicited during on-task states (F(1,15) = 4.59, p < 0.05). Our results
suggest that preattentive attentional processes can be amplified when
our thoughts drift off-task, a finding that demonstrates the adaptive
nature of information processing during mind wandering states.

terns of cognitive function following long-term MA abuse, we administered a distributed attentional network task of cognitive function (ANTI)
to 30 chronic MA abusers (mean age = 39.4 + 8.7 yrs) who were currently
drug abstinent (range 1 mos to 4 yrs) and 23 controls (mean age = 30.1 +
8.8 yrs). Mean duration of MA use was 14.2 years. In this task subjects
identified the direction of a centrally presented arrow using a keypress.
We examined the interaction between group (MA and controls), alerting
tones, location cueing and congruency between the target arrows and
flanking distractor stimuli. All participants were faster when the tone
preceded the trial onset, but no group differences emerged (p = .12). Both
groups were faster on trials in which a valid cue preceded the location of
the target arrow, but again no group differences were observed (p=.33).
Of primary interest was the finding that the MA abusers had a bigger
congruency effect than controls (p = .048). That is, MA abusers were
more influenced by the conflict between the peripheral arrows and the
central target arrow. These results suggest that chronic MA abusers display cognitive deficits that may reflect a specific vulnerability to distraction. These findings are consistent with other studies that have reported
deficits in anterior attentional systems and top-down cognitive control.

PHASE RESETTING OF DYNAMIC ATTENDING SIGNALS Karl Doron1, Mari

Jones2, Hermann Hinrichs3, Michael Gazzaniga1,4; 1University of California,
Santa Barbara, 2Ohio State University, 3Otto von Guericke University of
Magdeburg, 4Sage Center for the Study of the Mind — Attention to events in
the natural environment can be controlled by temporal context. An oscillatory process that is capable of entraining to rhythmic sequences can
model the neural and behavioral results observed in some attention
experiments. An important aspect of an entrained oscillator is its flexibility: it demonstrates a capacity to adjust its period and phase to changes
in the external driving rhythm. These adjustments to external rate
changes can be observed in phase resets of an entrained EEG or MEG
signal. To date, no studies in humans have investigated low frequency
entrainment to a rhythmic visual stimulus, nor have phase resets to temporal perturbations been reported. Here, we report phase resetting in
MEG signals recorded during rhythmical presentations of a lexical decision task. The phase of the delta band (1-3Hz) and the period of amplitude peaks in the alpha band (8-12Hz) entrain to the stimulus rate
(1.667Hz) and also demonstrate phase shifts to temporal perturbations
(+/- 120ms). These results show that neural oscillations in humans
entrain to rhythmic visual input and further, that their adaptive behavior
conforms to that of a limit-cycle oscillator when a stimulus arrives out of
phase with an expected onset time.

EMOTIONAL ENHANCEMENT OF RECALL UNDER DEPLETED VISUAL
ATTENTION: AN EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL INVESTIGATION Claire

Pottage1, Adam Rickart2, Alexandre Schaefer2; 1University of Leeds, 2University
of Durham — The current study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to

investigate the role of attention in the emotional modulation of memory
encoding. 25 participants viewed a series of negative and neutral images,
and next undertook a free recall test. During the presentation of images
at encoding a rapid number sequence was visually presented, superimposed on each image. During Full Attention conditions participants were
instructed to ignore this number sequence. During Divided Attention
conditions participants were asked to watch this sequence closely and
were then asked how many “5’s” appeared. Behavioural results show
that division of attention severely impaired recall performance, however
a significant effect of emotion on recall (negative images were recalled
more frequently than neutral) was still observed in the Divided Attention condition. ERP waveforms were formed according to the subsequent memory effect in which encoding-related ERPs are separated
based upon whether items were subsequently recalled or forgotten. In
addition, ERPs were separated according to emotion (Negative vs. Neutral) and attention (Full Attention vs. Divided Attention). Results show a
robust subsequent memory effect (ERPs are more positive-going for sub-

sequently recalled vs. forgotten items) in an early time window. The subsequent memory effect was present only for negative items in a late time
window, and this effect was present in both attention conditions. These
results suggest that emotion can modulate encoding-related neural activity even in conditions where visual attention is severely depleted. These
findings can inform long standing debates about the role of pre-attentive
processes in emotional memory formation.

CONTROLLING THE UNCONSCIOUS: ATTENTIONAL TASK SETS
MODULATE SUBLIMINAL SEMANTIC AND VISUO-MOTOR PROCESSES
DIFFERENTIALLY Markus Kiefer1, Ulla Martens2, Ulrich Ansorge3;

1University of Ulm, Germany, 2University of Osnabrück, Germany, 3University of

Vienna, Austria — Are unconscious processes susceptible to attentional
influences? In classical theories of automaticity and attention, unconscious automatic processes are thought to be independent of higher-level
attentional influences. In contrast to this classical view, our attentional
sensitization model (Kiefer and Martens 2010) proposes that automatic
processing depends on attentional enhancement of task-congruent processing pathways: A stimulus can only elicit an automatic process if the
process-relevant stimulus dimension belongs to the active attentional
set. This hypothesis was tested with a novel procedure for masked
semantic priming of words (Experiment 1) and masked visuo-motor
priming of geometrical shapes (Experiment 2). Before masked prime presentation, participants attended in an induction task either to semantic
or perceptual object features designed to activate a semantic or perceptual task set, respectively. Behavioral and electrophysiological effects
showed a differential modulation of subliminal priming by the induction
tasks: Semantic priming, involving access to conceptual meaning, was
found after the semantic but not after the perceptual induction task.
Visuo-motor priming was only observed after the perceptual but not
after the semantic induction task. This demonstrates that unconscious
cognition is influenced by attentional control. Unconscious processes in
perceptual and semantic processing streams are coordinated in congruency with higher-level action goals. Hence, in line with the attentional
sensitization model automatic processing of unconscious stimuli is susceptible to top-down control for optimizing goal-related information
processing. Reference Kiefer, M., & Martens, U. (2010). Attentional sensitization of unconscious cognition: Task sets modulate subsequent
masked semantic priming. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,

etal and occipital regions are involved in anticipatory deployment of
visual spatial attention, our understanding of the functional interactions
between brain regions and the dynamics of large-scale cortical networks
is just emerging. We used whole-head MEG source imaging to derive
measures of local synchronization and cortical-cortical synchronization
that reveal the functional organization of cortical systems underlying
anticipatory deployment of visual spatial attention. A symbolic cue
instructed subjects to covertly deploy and hold attention to the left or
right in anticipation of a unilateral S2 stimulus occurring one second
later at either the cued or uncued location (50/50 probability). Subjects
performed a go/no-go target discrimination if the S2 occurred at the
cued location. Source imaging of single trial data to the cortical surface
was performed and reduced to regions of interest for analyses. Local
synchronization was measured within each cortical region at multiple
frequency bands. Cortical interactions between regions were assessed in

94

each frequency band via phase-locking values. Results demonstrate
direction-specific modulations of local synchronization in frontal, parietal and sensory regions during the delay following the cue, in support
of large-scale networks. Significant cortical interactions were found not
only between parietal-sensory regions and frontal-sensory regions, but
also between frontal and parietal control regions. The results reveal the
dynamic modulation of sensory regions by control regions and the coordination of control processes between frontal and parietal regions during
anticipatory deployment of attention.

THE ADAPTIVE CHARACTER OF THE ATTENTIONAL SYSTEM: EVIDENCE
FROM EVENT RELATED POTENTIAL Xiaonan Liu1, Matthew Walsh1, Lynne

Reder1; 1Carnegie Mellon University — The limited capacity of the human
attentional system necessitates a mechanism for effectively selecting and
responding to goal-relevant stimuli while disregarding irrelevant ones.
To examine the adaptive character of the attentional system and theoretical accounts of the negative priming effect, we recorded response times
(RT) and event-related potentials (ERP) in a target localization task that
varied the probability of a distractor appearing in each of the 4 possible
locations while targets were equi-probable in each location. A target and
distractor were flashed briefly and the subject quickly indicated the target location. A pair of displays, prime followed by probe, defined a trial.
A negative prime trial occured when the location of the target in the
probe display was the distractor location in the prime display. RTs were
faster when the distractor occurred in its frequent location and when targets appeared in the location that never contained a distractor. ERP
results showed that the N2 component, often associated with inhibition,
was of higher amplitude when the distractor occurred in its frequent
location. Negative-prime, compared with positive-prime or control trials, were slowest and also showed the largest P300 amplitude; however,
these negative-priming effects, both in RT and P300 amplitude, were
smallest when targets followed distractors in the frequent distractor
location, a finding that is inconsistent with the episodic-retrieval account
(e.g., Neil, 1997). These results indicate that the attentional system is sensitive to statistical patterns and can make short- and long-term adjustments in preferences based on prior history of inspecting unsuccessful
locations.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PATTERN OF INTRAMODAL ATTENTIONAL
MECHANISMS: EVIDENCE FROM A CAR DRIVING SIMULATION STUDY

Manfred F. Gugler1, Claudia Sannelli2, Stefan Haufe2, Ruth Schubert1, Michael
Tangermann2, Gabriel Curio1; 1Charité University Medicine, Berlin, Germany,
2Technical University, Berlin, Germany — The goal of the present study was
to examine processing mechanisms in an intramodal divided visual
attention task by means of EEG. Therefore we used a paradigm with two
different conditions. In Condition C1 participants looked at a grey screen
and had to react as fast as possible to a randomly appearing red light by
pressing a foot pedal. In Condition C2 the grey screen was replaced by a
lane change task with subjects driving a simulated car while they additionally were asked to react to the randomly appearing red light. The
analysis of the alpha band power of the pre-stimulus EEG showed a
decreased parieto-occipital alpha band activity for C2 in contrast to C1
indicating a higher visual processing demand in C2. Furthermore, a
decreased frontal alpha band activity was present for fast compared to
slow reaction times. This latter finding indicates that fast processing of a
demanding dual task with intramodal stimulus competition requires
more activation of executive frontal cortices shown by an alpha suppression. Interestingly, a previous study using an intermodal (auditoryvisual) setting found an increased parieto-occipital alpha band activity
preceding fast reactions to auditory stimuli compared to slow reaction

EXPLORING THE MODULATION OF ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE BY SPATIAL
ATTENTIONAL CONTROL SETTINGS: CONVERGING EVIDENCE FROM
EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS Yoko Ishigami1, Jeff P Hamm2, Jason Satel1,

Raymond M Klein1; 1Dalhousie University, 2University of Auckland — Automatic attentional capture by a salient distractor can be prevented by spatial attentional control settings (ACSs) (e.g., Yantis & Joinides, 1990).
Recently, converging evidence for a spatial ACS (Schubö et al., 2007) was
found in event-related potentials (ERPs). In these studies, the ACS was
defined by a single target-relevant location. In an important extension,
Ishigami et al. (2008) demonstrated a successful ACS in performance that
was based on multiple (two) target-relevant locations. The purpose of
the current study is to seek converging evidence from ERPs for a spatial
ACS defined by multiple (two) target-relevant locations, using the methods in Ishigami et al. Any one of four figure-8s brightened uninformatively (cue) before presentation of a digit target, calling for a speeded
identification (2 or 5). A spatial ACS was encouraged because in different blocks, the digit targets appeared only on the horizontal or vertical
axis. Performance was more impaired following the attended invalid
cues than following unattended invalid cues, consistent with Ishigami et
al. and verifying a successful spatial ACS. Cue-elicited visual evoked
potentials (VEPs) by the same cue were different for different ACS orientations: the amplitudes of early VEPs were greater when the location the
cue was presented in was target-relevant than when the location was target-irrelevant. These results re-affirm that attentional capture by irrelevant salient stimuli can be modulated by spatial ACSs defined by
multiple target locations in performance and provide converging evidence from ERPs for the previously established behavioral findings.

VOLUNTARY ORIENTING OF ATTENTION WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS ?

Centre de Recherche de l'Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle epiniere, UMRproS975, Paris, France, 2Catholic University, Milan, Italy — Automatic
cesses are claimed to be independent of attention or intention and do not
require consciousness, while controlled processes require both intention
and consciousness (Posner & Snyder, 1975). Would it then be possible to
voluntarily orient attention without consciousness? In the present study
participants detected supra-threshold lateralized targets preceded by
subliminal semantic central cues. Our results demonstrated that when
the semantic value of the cue predicted the target location (i.e. on 85% of
the trials a “left” cue indicated a left presented target), participants were
able to orient attention and respond faster at the attended location, even
if the cue was never reported subjectively, and cue d’ was not significantly different from zero in all participants. Importantly, when the
semantic value of the cue was counterpredictive (i.e. the cue predicted
on 15% of the trials the location of the target, therefore a “left” cue indicated a right presented target on 85% of the trials), participants
responses were faster at the semantically indicated location during the
first block of trials, but the effect reversed during the second block, in
which participants were faster at the statistically predicted location. This
indicates that even in the absence of consciousness of the cues, participants were able to detect cue-target contingencies and voluntary orient
attention. This finding questions the traditional view of control processes, which might be exerted in the absence of consciousness of stimuli
(in the present study) or its contingencies (Bartolomeo et al. 2005).

Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, London, UK. — When two consecutive events appear at the same spatial location, responses to the second event are slower than those to the first. This effect, known as
inhibition of return (IOR), reflects a bias to preferentially attend to novel
locations, which is necessary to explore our environment efficiently.
Patients with right brain damage and left visual neglect explore their
environment asymmetrically, with a bias towards processing right-sided
stimuli more efficiently than left-sided ones. We demonstrate that
neglect patients have impaired manual IOR for right-sided, ipsilesional
targets when orienting attention covertly (without eye movements), but
their saccadic IOR (overt orienting) may be preserved. All patients with
impaired covert IOR had either parietal damage or fronto-parietal disconnection. In a second experiment, we used off-line repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on normal participants to determine
the role of two parietal regions in the right hemisphere right (intraparietal sulcus –IPS, and temporo-parietal junction -TPJ) in covert and overt
IOR. rTMS on right IPS disrupted ipsilateral IOR in both covert and
overt conditions. TPJ results are currently under analysis; we expect to
observe a dissociation between overt and covert IOR similar to that
occurring in neglect patients.

DORSAL AND VENTRAL PARIETAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPATIAL
ORIENTING Ana B. Chica1, Antoni Valero-Cabré2, Paolo Bartolomeo1;

INSERM UPMC U975, 2CNRS UMR 7225 — Influential models based on
fMRI have outlined a dorsal fronto-parietal network for the orienting of
both endogenous and exogenous attention, and a ventral system in
attentional re-orienting to task-relevant events. Nonetheless, given the
low temporal resolution and susceptibility to epiphenomenal BOLD
responses of fMRI, such depictions remain highly debated. We hereby
benefited from the high temporal resolution and causal power of eventrelated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to explore the implications of key dorsal and ventral parietal regions in endogenous and exogenous attention. We provide for the first time causal evidence of right
intraparietal sulcus (IPS) involvement in both types of attentional orienting. Temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), on the other hand, was selectively
implicated in exogenous orienting.

LEFT/RIGHT HEMISPACE DIFFERENCES IN STIMULI PERCEPTION AND
1Jagiellonian
IMAGINATION: A CASE STUDY Anna
Grzybkowska1;
University, Krakow, Poland — The goal of this study was to investigate the
left/right hemispace differences in the egocentric (related to subject's
body) and allocentric (related to object) coordinates of space. 28 year-old,
left-handed man with agenesis of the corpus callosum participated in the
study. He was asked to compare angles between clock hands of the two
clocks presented or imagined on the right or left side of the screen (egocentrically). The clock hands were localized on the right or left side of the
clock (allocentrically). The subject made responses with his left or right
hand. Only correctness level was analyzed because of generally low level
of performance (reaction time data for incorrect responses were
excluded). The left-side priority of stimuli perception was observed in
the egocentric and allocentric conditions. In the allocentric condition of
imaginary task the level of performance was higher when stimuli were
localized on the left side. In the egocentric one priority of right-sided
stimuli was observed. There was no influence of hand. Generally, these
results are in agreement with results obtained from normal subjects
which show priority of left-sided stimuli (Bowers & Heilman, 1980). The
influence of hand was hypothesized according to Kinsbourne’s theory of
attention (Kinsbourne, 1970).

THE ROLE OF THE PULVINAR IN DISTRACTOR PROCESSING AND VISUAL

Heinze1, C.N. Boehler1, J.-M. Hopf1; 1Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology and
University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany, 2Departments of Psychology
and Neurology and Center for Mind and Brain, University of California, Davis —
The pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus are hypothesized to be involved in
attentional selection in vision. Different models have, however, been
proposed for the precise role of the pulvinar in attention. One proposal is
that the pulvinar mediates shifts of spatial attention; a different proposal
is that it serves the filtering of distractor information. At present the relation between these possible operations and their relative importance in
the pulvinar remains unresolved. We address this issue by contrasting
both proposals in two fMRI experiments. We used a visual search paradigm that permitted us to dissociate neural activity reflecting shifts of
attention from activity underlying distractor filtering. Both, distractor filtering and shifts of attention produced activations in regions of the central-lateral intralaminar and medio-dorsal nuclei of the thalamus outside
the pulvinar. In contrast, distractor filtering, but not the operation of
shifting attention, was associated with strong activity enhancements in
dorsal and ventral regions of the pulvinar, indicating that distractor filtering is the preponderant attentional operation subserved by the pulvinar.

EEG DYNAMICS OF INHIBITION OF RETURN AS REVEALED BY
INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS Sven
Hoffmann1,
Edmund

Wascher1; 1Leibniz Research Centre, Dortmund — Inhibition of Return (IOR)
is one of the best investigated effects in experimental psychology. However, up to now there is still an open debate about the mechanisms
involved and their neurophysiological implementation. In the present
study, IOR was tested by means of the well known cue-target design
with varying SOAs and the EEG was simultaneously acquired from 60
electrodes. The analysis of standard event-related potentials (ERPs) replicated already known effects. However, a deeper analysis of the eventrelated EEG-activity by Independent Component Analysis revealed a
complex interaction of brain sources contributing to the IOR effect. An
unexpected but core result is that fronto-central structures, which have
been assigned to executive control, cannot easily be related to the IOR
effect. Though the components accounting for the correct response negativity (CRN) did vary with the cueing of the target location, they did not
show a data pattern which fits into theories about the generation of the
CRN or current theories about IOR, i.e. they were more pronounced for
uncued compared to cued targets indicating cue-target correspondence
rather than IOR. Furthermore, a complex modulation of component
activity accounting for early event-related potentials was found, which
indicates a considerable contribution of low-level attentional processes
to the IOR effect. Lateralized components over parieto-occipital areas
were less activated if a target was cued as if it was uncued. This effect
was stronger for the left visual field compared to the right one. A corresponding component interaction was found for occipital components
indicating inhibition of cued target locations.

ENCODING A SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS
REQUIRES SELECTION OF EACH OBJECT Lauren E. Kahn1, Steven L.

Franconeri1; 1Northwestern University — Object recognition relies on a network that codes object identities across diffuse regions of the visual field,
often leading to uncertainty about the locations of any given object. One
solution to this problem may be to isolate a single location with selective
attention, allowing recovery of the object identity at that location. We
show that this solution is used in the simplest displays involving just
two objects (e.g., a green circle on the left, a red circle on the right). When
participants are required to encode the relative spatial location of two
colored patches, eye movements reveal that they systematically select
the two objects in a left-to-right sequence. This sequence remains even

96

when participants are explicitly instructed to maintain fixation. A control experiment shows that when object locations are made irrelevant by
changing the task to a same-different identity judgment, the left-to-right
bias disappears. When identity must be attached to object locations, each
object may need to be selected sequentially, but not when a task allows
identity to be diffusely coded across space. This sequential selection
effect raises a puzzle: If we must select one object at a time, how can we
recover the relative spatial location between two objects, to judge that
the red is to the right of the green? We speculate that the sequence itself
can be used to produce this judgment: extracting the vector created by
the shift of attention (rightward) would provide the relative location of
the object that was selected second (red).

SPATIO-TEMPORAL CORRELATES OF MULTIPLE-OBJECT-TRACKING
Christian Merkel1, Christian Stoppel1, Jens-Max Hopf1, Mircea Ariel
theoretical
Schoenfeld1; 1Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg — The

framework of multiple objects tracking is a matter of debate. In the current study we employed EEG/MEG recordings in conjunction with a
modified multiple objects tracking task to investigate the spatiotemporal
correlates of the underlying neural processes. Four out of eight different
objects were presented as to be tracked targets by 2 brief subsequent
brightness alternations. During a 3 second randomized movement all
objects moved into a final spatial configuration that was identical in each
trial. Four objects were again highlighted by a brief brightness increment
(probe) of same spatial configuration that could contain all possible combinations of targets and distractors. Subjects pressed one of two buttons
to indicate whether the probe contained all targets or not and were faster
and more accurate when the probe contained either all 4 or none of the
targets. ERPs and ERFs time-locked to the probe showed an early amplitude modulation in the time range of the N180 that correlated with the
subject’s behavioral measures. A second amplitude effect in the time
range of the N270 component correlated with the number of targets contained in the probe regardless of the subject’s behavior. Source analyses
revealed bilateral sources localizing to the object-perception sensitive
area LO for the N180 effect and in the medial parietal cortex for the N270
component effect. The results suggest that multiple-object-tracking was
facilitated by the segmentation of a geometrical shape from the spatial
configuration of the target objects.

VISUAL
ORIENTING
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
SPECIFIC
NEUROTRANSMITTER GENETIC MARKERS Rebecca Lundwall1, Dong-

chuan Guo2, James Dannemiller1; 1Rice University, 2University of Texas Health
Science Center at Houston — There is currently a sense that individual differences in visual orienting show little variation by genotype (Fan, Wu,
Fossella, & Posner, 2001). Yet in previous research using this paradigm,
costs have been combined with benefits into an overall validity score. If
costs and benefits are determined by (even partially) distinct neural
mechanisms, then they should be analyzed separately. This is consistent
with Posner’s formulation of orienting as a three-step process of disengaging, moving and then re-engaging attention at a new location. This is
important because disengaging attention (which is necessary for invalid
but not for valid cues) could have separate genetic influences. Here we
show significant associations between visual orienting and genetic markers (on COMT, DAT1, and APOE; R2s from 4% to 9%). We used Posner’s
(1980) cued-orienting paradigm and added trials with dual cues of
unequal luminance (Kean & Lambert, 2003). Normal subjects (N = 161)
responded manually to the location of a target that appeared after the
presentation of one or two cues. One measure in particular -- the mean
RT cost of a single dim, invalid cue -- was associated with dopaminergic
markers on COMT and DAT1. Variations in the APOE genotype based
on the ?2/?3/?4 alleles were also associated with mean RT differences
produced by simultaneous cues with unequal luminances. Additionally,
we find increased RT variability in subjects with the GG genotype on
COMT (rs4680). We conclude that individual differences in visual orient-

Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany — Studies in stroke patients
who were tested with the subjective visual vertical (SVV) identified the
posterior insula as well as the parietal cortex as crucial cortical substrates
for visual verticality perception. As the vestibular system is organized in
a multisensory way it appears straightforward to assume a cortical representation of verticality in other senses, i.e. in the haptic modality. To
our knowledge, little is known about the neural representation of the
haptic vertical in humans. Here, we analysed which brain areas are typically lesioned in patients with unilateral right-hemispheric stroke showing deficits in the subjective haptic vertical (SHV) in the frontal (roll)
plane. Patients were blindfolded and stabilized in their head-and-trunkposition and had to adjust a movable metal rod until they perceived it as
vertical. One half of the patients showed a significant tilt in the SHV,
while performances of the other half were within the normal range.
Lesions were analyzed according to Rorden & Brett (2000) using MRIcro
1.40. Subtraction analysis revealed that the right inferior and medial temporal gyrus might be one crucial cortical substrate of impaired performance in the SHV. However, the diffuse lesion overlap of the impaired
patients seems to argue for a complex postcentral network for estimating
the haptic vertical. In conclusion, these results show that a diffuse righthemispheric parieto-temporal network is involved in the processing of
gravity information in the haptic modality.

RAPID ATTENTIONAL SELECTION OF VISUAL ITEMS IN THE ABSENCE OF
COMPETING DISTRACTORS John J. McDonald1, David J. Prime1,2; 1Simon
Fraser University, 2Douglas College — The

lateralized organization of the
visual system has made it possible to investigate the selective processing
of salient items in visual search displays. Attending to such an item is
known to elicit a lateralized component of the event-related potential
(ERP) called the N2pc, which is thought to reflect attentional processing
in the contralateral occipital lobe. Basic sensory explanations for the
N2pc have been ruled out using balanced displays containing a relevant
singleton on one side of fixation and an equally salient but irrelevant singleton on the other side of fixation. The drawback of this method is that
is does not permit investigation of attentional processing of a visual
stimulus presented in an otherwise empty visual field (e.g., peripheral
cue or target). To study attentional selection of such stimuli, we examined ERPs elicited when a lateral stimulus was attended and when it was
ignored. In separate blocks, participants performed demanding discrimination tasks involving the peripheral stimulus (peripheral condition) or
non-lateralized changes at fixation (fixation condition). Comparison of
the ERPs in the two conditions revealed lateralized selection negativities
in the peripheral condition but not in the fixation condition. The earliest
lateralized selection negativity occurred 120-180 ms after display onset
and was focused over the lateral occipital scalp. This "early N2pc" was
absent in the fixation condition, indicating that it was due to attention
rather than lateral sensory imbalance. These results indicate that spatial
attention can be allocated rapidly to targets in the absence of competing
nontargets.

ABNORMALITIES OF THE P3A WAVE IN INDIVIDUALS HIGH IN
PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY TRAITS Patrick Carolan1, Fern Jaspers-

Fayer1, Isabel Taake1, Kevin Douglas1, Mario Liotti1; 1Simon Fraser
University — Psychopathy, a subcategory of the DSM-IV diagnosis of

Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD), is characterized by two key traits:
diminished emotional capability, and the tendency to engage in impulsive, antisocial behaviours. Abnormalities in the visual attention processes of individuals with psychopathic personality disorder have been
previously observed, particularly with relation to the posteriorly distributed “P3b” component. In contrast, the influence of psychopathy on the
anteriorly distributed P3a wave has not been investigated. We hypothesized that high-trait individuals would show abnormal P3a amplitudes.
The current high-density electroencephalography (EEG) study examines
differential effects of a novel stimulus Oddball task on psychopathy
using a between groups design comparing subjects rated high and low in
traits related to the condition. High-trait and low-trait individuals were
identified using the Short Form of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI-SF). Subjects performed a modified visual Oddball task that
allowed selective averaging not only of frequent irrelevant standards
(76%) and infrequent task-relevant targets (12%), but also infrequent
novel distracters (12). Standard and target stimuli were numbers, while
novel stimuli were a variety of shapes. High-trait individuals, relative to
low-trait individuals displayed not only reductions of the P3b amplitude
to targets, but also a marked decrease in voltage of the anterior P3a
waves to both targets and novel stimuli. While additional research must
be conducted on the relation of the “P3a” component to psychopathy,
the present results suggest that psychopathy may entail abnormal processing of target relevance and novelty in frontal brain regions like the
anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

THE SPATIAL PROFILE OF SELECTIVE ATTENTION INTERACTS WITH
SEGMENTATION Yee-Joon Kim1, Preeti Verghese1; 1Smith-Kettlewell Eye
Research Institute — We investigated how selective attention to a target
embedded in a textured background interacts with segmentation processes. Observers attended to an eccentric target surrounded by a concentric annulus that was either coextensive with the target
(unsegmented) or segmented from it by the introduction of a small gap,
or a phase offset. A brief contrast increment appeared on the target on
50% of the trials. Successful detection of the increment required selecting
the target and suppressing the surround, particularly when the target
did not segment from the surround. We used steady state visual evoked
potentials (SSVEP) with target and background tagged with different
frequencies, to unambiguously monitor the response from target, background, and nonlinear-temporal interactions between them at the sum
and difference frequencies. We hypothesized that selective attention
would suppress the surround in the unsegmented condition, resulting in
a weaker response at the background frequency, and a stronger interaction between target and surround regions. For each observer we collected high-density EEG data from increment-absent trials. We then used
a minimum norm inverse procedure combined with realistic MRderived head models and retinotopically-mapped visual areas to estimate cortical activities for target, annulus, and interaction terms. Attention to the unsegmented target decreased the response to background in
area V1 (relative to the unsegmented condition), and increased the target/background interactions in retionotopic areas. The evoked response
to the target remained unchanged across the different conditions. These
results indicate that selective attention involves an active suppression of
textured backgrounds that appear co-extensive with the target.

IT'S TEA TIME! THEANINE AND CAFFEINE EFFECTS ON VISUAL
ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO AN ACUTE
STRESSOR Stephanie Gagnon1,2, Caroline Mahoney1,2, Tad Brunye1,2,

Grace Giles1,2, Robin Kanarek1; 1Tufts University, 2US Army NSRDEC, Natick,
MA — Tea is often perceived as less arousing and more relaxing than coffee, even though both beverages contain similar amounts of caffeine. The
amino acid theanine, naturally occurring in tea and more recently being
added to energy drinks, may be responsible for these reported differences by influencing brain activity, cortisol, mood, and cognition. Here
we investigated whether theanine, alone or in combination with caffeine,
would reduce stress response and impact cognitive performance on two
tasks involving visual attention and perception. Participants completed
four test sessions, receiving a combination of caffeine (0 mg, 200 mg)
and/or theanine (0 mg, 200 mg). After treatment administration, participants viewed a highly arousing and negatively valenced video, and then
completed the attention network task (ANT) and a hierarchical pattern
task. Our findings suggest that a dose of 200 mg caffeine or theanine
does not affect relatively lower order visual attention (i.e., alerting or orienting), but does influence executive control (i.e., conflict resolution).
While caffeine consumption enhanced executive control following exposure to stress, theanine reversed this effect, perhaps due to its anxiolytic
properties. We also found that theanine mitigated a caffeine-induced
global processing bias, such that performance was no different than with
placebo or theanine alone. Given theanine's growing consumption rates
in the US, these results carry implications for the way in which people
attend to and process information, and further enhance our understanding of how caffeine and theanine might modulate brain activity in areas
mediating visual attention, such as the anterior cingulate and prefrontal
cortex.

ALPHA-BAND EEG POWER CHANGES WITH WORKING MEMORY LOAD

Viswanathan2, Kristina Visscher1; 1University of Alabama at Birmingham,
Department of Neurobiology, 2University of California, Santa Barbara,
Department of Psychology — Since they were first observed, alpha EEG

oscillations have been implicated in many different processes. First
thought to reflect an idling rhythm, this hypothesis has been largely
overtaken by a framework where the amplitude of alpha oscillations
reflects a level of cortical inhibition. However, some studies found contradictory results and the precise nature of brain alpha oscillations is still
a matter of debate. Sixteen healthy subjects performed three visual attention tasks including one or two consecutive stimuli (containing 2, 4 or 6
oriented rectangles) and a probe. Depending on the task, subjects were
instructed to ignore or to remember one of the stimuli, and indicate
whether the remembered stimulus matched the probe or not. Alpha (12
Hz) oscillations were analyzed over a time window starting before the
first stimulus and ending at the probe onset. Before the appearance of the
first stimulus, preparation to ignore a stimulus elicited significantly
higher alpha power in frontal electrodes compared to preparation to
memorize a stimulus. This difference lasted until after stimulus presentation. During the memory maintenance phase, alpha power significantly increased as the number of shapes increased. This difference
evolved over time, and was located in left central region earlier, and in
left occipito-central and right frontal regions later. Moreover, left parietal
electrodes showed an increased coherence with left central electrodes as
memory load increased. Considering the temporal and spatial evolution
of these results, it is therefore likely that alpha oscillations reflect processes that can have different manifestations in different brain regions.

WHEN "IT" BECOMES "MINE": ATTENTIONAL BIASES TRIGGERED BY
OBJECT OWNERSHIP David Turk1, Joanne Brebner1, Olav Krigolson2, Todd

Handy3; 1University of Aberdeen, 2Dalhousie University, 3University of British
Columbia — Previous research demonstrates that higher order cognitive
processes associated with the allocation of selective attention are
engaged when highly familiar self-relevant items are encountered, such
as one's name, face, places and the like. The goal of our study here was to
determine whether these effects on attentional processing are triggered
on-line at the moment self-relevance is established. We recorded eventrelated potentials (ERPs) as participants viewed common objects (e.g.,
apple, socks, ketchup) in the context of an "ownership" paradigm, where
the presentation of each object was followed by a cue indicating whether
the object nominally belonged either to the participant (a "self" cue) or
the experimenter (an "other" cue). We found that "self" ownership cues
were associated with increased attentional processing, as measured via
the P300 component. In addition, that at a visual-perceptual level, spatial
attention became more narrowly focused on objects owned by self, as
measured via the lateral occipital P1 ERP component. Taken together,
our findings indicate that self-relevant attention effects triggered by the
act of taking ownership of objects are associated with both perceptual
and post-perceptual processing in cortex.

FMRI HYPOACTIVATION ON A VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION TASK AFTER

Sara LaHue1, Shelly Cooper1, Anne Heffernan1; 1University of California, San
Francisco — The present study investigated the impact of acute mild trau-

matic brain injury (TBI) on the neural circuitry of visuospatial attention.
Eleven controls and 10 patients (1 month post injury) were enrolled in
the study. In an event-related flanker task. , the congruent trials consisted of five arrows in the same direction, whereas the incongruent trials contained flankers in the opposite direction as the center arrow. The
neutral condition consisted of only one arrow. fMRI was acquired on a
3T GE scanner. All image processing was performed using SPM5. Comparison of the incongruent and congruent conditions revealed that both
healthy controls and patients engaged bilateral cingulate for conflicting
information but controls had additional activations in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA).
In the incongruent>neutral contrast, relative to controls, patients showed
decreased activations in left DLPFC and bilateral fusiform and hippocampus but increased activations in occipital gyri. In the congruent>neutral contrast, in comparison with controls, patients demonstrated
decreased activation in left DLPFC, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,
and bilateral premotor and motor cortices such as pre-SMA, SMA, precentral and postcentral gyri. Lower activations in DLPFC and medial
PFC in the incongruent condition suggest disrupted conflict processing
in the flanker task. Increased activations in the occipital cortex for incongruent condition suggests more effortful visual information processing.
The decreased activations in pre-motor and prefrontal areas in patients
in response to conditions without conflict may reflect impaired engagement of the attention network in general.

EXOGENOUS ATTENTION MODULATES ECHO SUPPRESSION Sam

London1,2, Christopher W. Bishop1,2, Lee M. Miller1,2,3; 1University of
California, Davis, 2Center for Mind and Brain, 3Department of Neurobiology,
Physiology, and Behavior — In noisy acoustic environments, the brain can
suppress distracting information through high-level processes such as
exogenous attention. It can also use relatively early “unimodal” mechanisms such as the precedence effect, or echo suppression, to achieve the
same purpose. The goal of this study was to investigate whether exogenous attention exerts top-down modulation of echo suppression. In a
psychophysical experiment, human subjects (N=22) were presented with
pairs of noise bursts: a leading burst followed 2-15 msec later by a lagging or “echo” burst, 36 degrees apart in frontal space. The sound pairs

occurred either with or without a light flash 300 msec before sound
onset, intended to orient exogenous attention. These flashes were colocalized with either the leading sound, thus orienting attention to the
veridical location, or the lagging sound, thus diverting attention away
from it. On each trial, subjects reported with a button press whether they
heard one or two distinct sounds (echo suppressed or not suppressed,
respectively). In a repeated measures ANOVA, compared to a no-flash
condition, the echo suppression rate increased by 8.23% (p<0.05) with a
flash at the leading sound location, and decreased by 9.85% (p<0.01)
with a flash at the lagging sound location. The results show that exogenous attention can modulate the much earlier process of echo suppression, thereby improving perception of distinct objects in complex
auditory environments.

Spatial neglect is a perplexing neuropsychological syndrome, in which
patients fail to detect contralesionnal stimuli. A recent study showed
that spatial neglect may reflect a combination of different component
deficits, two of which were associated with lesions in the right prefrontal
and inferior parietal regions, respectively. The present study tested for
dissociable behaviors across two tasks designed to probe for such components in 14 patients with right frontal versus parietal damage, respectively. In the “attention control” task, patients had to respond to visual
stimuli presented centrally in three conditions. Only the frontal patients
showed slower reaction times when central stimuli were presented with
a right distractor. In the “spatial remapping” task, patients were asked to
detect a target in a series of successive visual stimuli presented horizontally across three conditions. The parietal patients were unable to benefit
from the predictability of the target position, with similar reaction times
across all conditions; by contrast, patients with frontal lesions showed
progressive decreases in reaction times in conditions with a regular succession of stimuli (compared to the random condition). Taken together,
these results support the view that frontal damage may contribute to left
inattention by disrupting top-down control and resistance to distractors,
while parietal damage may disrupt the maintenance of stable locations
in space across eye movements or time. This further suggests that left
neglect may arise as a combined breakdown or impaired connectivity
between frontal and parietal regions involved (respectively) in the executive and storage components of spatial working memory.

ERP CORRELATES OF OVERT AND COVERT ORIENTING Nathan

Parks1,
Arthur Kramer1; 1Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology,
University of Illinois — There has long been a link proposed between overt
eye movements and covert shifts of visual spatial attention. A variety of
behavioral and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated considerable
overlap between human attention and saccadic cortical networks. Here,
we used event-related potentials (ERP) to examine similarities and differences in those networks. Covert and overt orienting were manipulated between blocks as subjects performed a standard spatial cuing task.
A foveal arrow cue indicated the location of an upcoming target (small
black or white dot) with 75% validity. Upon the onset of the target stimulus subjects either maintained fixation and gave a manual response to
the target (covert) or performed a saccade to the target location (overt).
ERPs time-locked to the onset of the symbolic spatial cue revealed that
the posterior P2 and late directing attention positivity (LDAP) components exhibited greater amplitude in overt relative to covert conditions.
These results are consistent with the proposal that overt and covert orienting share overlapping cortical networks but vary in the gain within
those networks.

VISUAL SEARCH FOR A POPOUT TARGET INCREASES INDUCED THETA
POWER OVER CONTRALATERAL VISUAL CORTEX Jarrod R. Dowdall1,

Artur Luczak1, Matthew S. Tata1; 1University of Lethbridge — The efficiency of
visual search for a target in a cluttered scene is known to depend on the
similarity between targets and distractors, however the differences
between the neural mechanisms subserving different kinds of search are
poorly understood. Recent work has focused on components of the
visual event-related potential (ERP) evoked by the onset of a visual
search display. The best studied of these is a negative deflection of the
ERP, known as the N2pc, which appears when the ERP waveform over
contralateral scalp sites is contrasted with that over ipsilateral sites.
Much less is known about differences in induced (i.e. non-phase locked)
electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during efficient and inefficient
search. Our goal was to characterize these differences with respect to
both phase and amplitude. Participants searched for either a C among
Os (efficient) or an O among Cs (inefficient). EEG was recorded at 128
scalp sites and induced (i.e. time-frequency) activity was analyzed, as
well as the evoked N2pc. We found the expected N2pc contralateral to
the target side. We also found that efficient search, but not inefficient
search, was characterized by low-frequency (i.e. delta and theta) intertrial amplitude increases present over the contralateral scalp.

FACILITATION AND INHIBITION OF RETURN USING NUMBERS AS
ATTENTIONAL CUES Danielle Hoffmann1, Valérie Goffaux1,2, Christine

Schiltz1; 1University of Luxembourg, 2University of Maastricht — Behavioural

studies have shown a relation between numbers and space (DeHevia et
al., 2008). Fischer and colleagues (2003) showed that digits can act as central spatial cues in a target detection task, resulting in shorter reaction
times (RT) for left-sided targets when preceded by small numbers and
for right-sided targets when preceded by large numbers. This facilitation
effect indicates that numbers orient visuo-spatial attention to the left or
right hemifield, depending on their magnitude. To date no studies investigated whether this facilitation is followed by inhibition of return at
longer intervals, as could be expected with visuo-spatial attention shifts.
To this aim, we designed an analogous paradigm to Fischer et al.’s, introducing additional longer intervals. Participants (n=22) were presented a
task irrelevant digit (1,2 vs. 8,9) for 400ms and had to detect a brief
(100ms) lateral target appearing after a variable interval (100, 250, 500,
750, 1000, 1250ms). A 2x6 repeated measures ANOVA of mean RT, with
congruency and interval as within-subject variables yielded a significant
interaction (F(5,21)=2.59, p=0.03). As expected, targets were detected significantly faster when appearing in the congruent (small-left, large-right)
hemifield after 250ms (t(21)=2.01, p=0.029) (cf. Fischer et al., 2003). At
1250ms interval, targets were detected significantly slower when they
appeared in the congruent compared to the incongruent hemifield
(t(21)=2.29, p=0.016). These findings provide the first evidence that digits
not only produce facilitation effects at shorter intervals, but also induce
inhibitory effects at longer intervals, confirming the visuo-spatial nature
of the attention shifts associated with Arabic digits.

SHIFTS OF SPATIAL ATTENTION CUED BY IRRELEVANT NUMBERS:
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FROM A TARGET DISCRIMINATION
TASK Anne-Marie Schuller1, Danielle Hoffmann1, Christine Schiltz1;

University of Luxembourg — Using a target detection task, Fischer and colleagues (2003) demonstrated that a centrally presented number can shift
attention to the left/right when its magnitude is small/large. Two recent
electrophysiological studies measured the time course of these spatial
shifts and showed attentional effects on visual evoked potentials on central parietal sites (Sallilas et al 2008; Ranzini et al 2009). Here we explore
these shifts in a target discrimination task to further characterize the subtle spatial attentional mechanisms triggered by numbers. Event-related
potentials (ERPs) were recorded on 64 electrodes while subjects performed a color discrimination task. They were presented a task irrele99

vant digit (1,2 vs. 8,9) for 400ms and had to discriminate the color (red/
green) of a brief (100ms) lateral target appearing after a variable interval
(250ms, 500ms). The target location could be congruent (left target/small
magnitude; right target/large magnitude) or incongruent to the shifts of
spatial attention induced by the digit. Target-locked ERPs were calculated for congruent and incongruent trials in time windows of -100to800
milliseconds post-target onset. Mean average amplitude was measured
on a moving 40 ms window every 10 ms. We observed a typical distribution of visual components (P1 and N1) on the occipito-parietal sites and
the N1 component was significantly enhanced in the congruent compared to the incongruent trials in both hemispheres for the intervals
between 170-230 ms (all ps<0.05). These results demonstrate that irrelevant digits also induce attentional shifts in a target color discrimination
task and thus confirm the visuo-spatial nature of attention shifts associated with numbers.

GAZE AND HEAD ORIENTATION REDUCE ATTENTIONAL BLINK FOR
SUBSEQUENT VISUAL EVENTS Chiara Maddalena Comparetti1,2, Swann

Pichon2, Patrik Vuilleumier2; 1University of Milano-Bicocca – Italy, 2Laboratory
for Behavioral Neurology and Imaging of Cognition, Medical School, University
of Geneva – Switzerland — Others’ gaze direction and body position are

powerful social cues indicating the presence of relevant information in
the environment. We investigated how the processing of gaze direction
(averted, directed) and head position (deviated, frontal) diminishes
attentional blink (AB) for subsequent visual events. AB refers to the
reduced detection of a stimulus (T2) during a brief time-window
(~250ms) following the detection of another first target stimulus (T1).
Subjects had to report the gender of a face (T1) with different gaze and
head orientation, and then categorize an indoor or outdoor scene (T2).
Both targets were embedded in a rapid stream of distractors. Behavioral
data showed that, outside the AB refractory-period, faces with gaze contact (vs. averted) facilitated the identification of T2_scenes, independently of head position. Recognition performance for T2_scenes was
diminished during the AB period, except after identification of T1_faces
with direct gaze and frontal head position. Comparison of trials where
T1_faces or T2_scenes were correctly vs incorrectly detected showed
increased activity in FFA and PPA respectively. Activity in bilateral IPS
decreased during AB in parallel to the decrease in T2 recognition performance. Analysis of trials where T1 and T2 were correctly recognized
showed that gaze contact increased activity within bilateral TPJ plus
regions of the face perception network (OFA, STS and anterior insula,
but not FFA), but these responses were drastically diminished during
AB. These results show that body and gaze position are powerful social
cues that modulate the AB effect and influence the observer's attention
for subsequent visual stimuli.

VISUAL ATTENTION AND PERSONALITY: ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL
DISSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CONSCIENTIOUS AND OPEN INDIVIDUALS ON
A LOCALIZED ATTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE TASK Kristin E. Wilson1,

Stephen M. Emrich1, Jacob B. Hirsh2, Megumi Noda1, Vince Brienza1, Susanne
Ferber1; 1University of Toronto, 2Northwestern University — Attentional abilities alter how we experience the world, thus contributing to both cognitive and personality development. This link between attention and
personality may be most evident in two of the Big Five personality traits,
namely Conscientiousness (C) - characterized by self-control, rule-following, skill on highly structured problems – and Openness (O) – characterized by exploration, creativity, and noticing peripheral information
(Ackerman, 1996; 1997; Peterson et al., 2002). To explore this relationship, participants completed a personality questionnaire before performing a Localized Attentional Intereference (LAI) task, while EEG was
recorded. The task consisted of a search array (200ms), containing a single coloured target (T) presented at different separations (Sep1, Sep3,
Sep5) from a distractor (L) among gray place-holders, positioned around
an invisible circle. Results showed a significant increase in accuracy from

100

Sep1 to Sep3 (LAI effect), where the challenge is to overcome interference and focus attention on the target; however, at Sep 5 accuracy
dropped to that of Sep1, indicating that the challenge may be to broaden
the scope of attention. C was positively correlated with Sep1 and 3 accuracy and marked by smaller Ptc amplitude, a measure of ability to inhibit
distractors. This may suggest superior performance in conditions that
rely on focused attention and distractor inhibition, reducing the load on
processing indexed by the Ptc. O showed a significant positive correlation with Sep5 accuracy and Ptc amplitude, suggesting an advantage in
this condition resulting from the deployment of a broad scope attention
and not inhibiting distractors, producing larger Ptc amplitude.

INTERHEMISPHERIC METABOLIC ASYMMETRIES ASSOCIATED WITH
VISUAL EXTINCTION IN CHRONIC PATIENTS Valentina Varalta1, Andrea

Lupi2, Carlo A. Marzi1, Nicola Smania1, Elena Natale1,3; 1University of Verona,
Nuclear Medicine, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, 3University of MilanoBicocca — Visual extinction is a spatio-temporal disorder of visual aware2

ness observed in stroke patients under conditions of stimulus competition. When examined with the confrontation technique right hemisphere
damaged patients with extinction frequently miss the left stimulus on
trials with double bilateral stimuli, whereas correctly detect it if presented alone. Moreover, in temporal order judgement (TOJ) tasks these
patients usually need the left stimulus to be presented with a temporal
lead in order to be perceived as simultaneous to the right one. The neural
correlates of these impairments are still a matter of issue. We used position emission tomography at rest to measure possible differences
between the cortical metabolism of two patients: one showing visual
extinction, both at confrontation and TOJ tasks, at a chronic stage; the
other one who recovered from extinction at a chronic stage. In both
patients, brain damage involved the fronto-temporo-parietal, but not the
occipital cortex, in the right hemisphere. We found that the structurally
intact visual cortex of the extinction patient was hypometabolic in the
right as compared to the left hemisphere, whereas no hemispheric asymmetry in the metabolism of visual cortex was found in the patient without extinction. Our data show that extinction is associated with neural
changes in structurally intact occipital areas. This is in keeping with neurophysiological evidence of abnormal activity in visual areas of extinction patients performing visuospatial tasks and suggests that this
functional impairment might be crucial to explain the lack of visual
awareness for contralesional stimuli in chronic extinction patients.

LARGE SCALE BETA AND GAMMA COUPLING DURING DIRECTED AND
AUTOMATIC VISUAL SEARCH Lawrence Behmer1, Ira E. Hyman2, K. J.

Jantzen2; 1Washington State University, 2Western Washington University —

Detecting changes in the environment involves both top-down visual
attention and bottom up processing of unique visual features. We used a
change blindness flicker paradigm in conjunction with EEG to investigate the neural dynamics of bottom up and top down processes during
visual search. We used phase locking value as a measure of large-scale
neural coupling in the high beta (20-30 Hz) and gamma bands (>30 Hz).
Nine participants searched for the change of a single letter embedded
among a field of distracters. Images were displayed for 400 ms and separated by a 200 ms grey mask. For top-down searches the change occurred
along a conjunction of features and thus require directed attention. Conversely, for bottom-up conditions the change occurred on a single
unique visual feature such that detection is rapid and automatic regardless of the number of distracters, A benefit of the change-blindness paradigm is that EEG can be time locked to search and detection processes
regardless of the number of distracters or search time. For both conditions changing targets were embedded among either 4 or 16 distracters.
We observed frontal-parietal phase locking in the beta band during topdown searches and significantly greater gamma activity during bottomup searches. These findings are in keeping with recent animal (Buschman & Miller, 2007) and human (Phillips & Takeda, 2009) work and

INVESTIGATING THE NEUROANATOMY OF SPATIAL NEGLECT WITH
MULTI-VOXEL PATTERN ANALYSIS David V. Smith1, John A. Clithero1,

Christopher Rorden2, Hans-Otto Karnath3; 1Duke University, 2Georgia Institute
for Technology, 3University of Tuebingen — Techniques for relating brain
lesions to a resulting behavioral deficit have improved dramatically over
the past decade. Nevertheless, lesion symptom mapping techniques are
inherently univariate, typically examining a single region (or voxel) in
isolation, ignoring the contributions of neighboring brain regions. We
addressed this limitation by using multi-voxel pattern analysis to identify brain regions that predict the presence or absence of spatial neglect
in a sample of lesion patients (N=140; 78 with neglect). We employed a
common machine-learning technique, sparse multinomial logistic
regression, to classify individuals based on high-resolution structural
brain scans. Performance of the classifier was tested using 140-fold crossvalidation; all classification was based on a leave-one-out testing procedure. We first identified the best univariate predictor of neglect, which
was a single voxel in superior temporal gyrus. We then utilized two
approaches for the multi-voxel analyses: 1) whole brain analysis, in
which all voxels are submitted to the classifier; and 2) combinatoric
region of interest (ROI) approach using ROIs from the Automated Anatomical Labeling and Juelich atlases. We found that the whole brain
approach was more predictive than the best-performing single voxel.
Similarly, using the combinatoric ROI approach, we found several ROI
pairs that were more predictive than the best-performing single voxel:
precentral gyrus and superior temporal pole; angular gyrus and corticospinal tract; precentral gyrus and middle temporal pole. These results
highlight the utility of multivariate approaches in lesion mapping,
potentially pointing to a revolutionary approach for using lesion data to
study brain function.

ABNORMALITIES IN WHITE MATTER CONNECTIVITY IN ADOLESCENTS
WITH CONDUCT DISORDER Emily Haney-Caron1, Michael Stevens1,2; 1Olin
Neuropsychiatry Research Center, The Institute of Living/Hartford Hospital,
2Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine — Objective:
Previous neuroimaging studies of brain structure have found only limited or no evidence for white matter volume abnormalities in Conduct
Disorder (CD), perhaps in part due to heterogeneity as a result of frequently comorbid AD/HD in studied samples. No previous studies
have tested whether CD youth have microstructural major white matter
tract abnormalities using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We hypothesized that DTI would detect frontal and temporal lobe white matter tract
abnormalities in CD youth without any psychiatric comorbidities. Participants and Methods: We used a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)
approach to compared fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of preferential diffusion along major white matter tracts, between 17 CD adolescents and 26 healthy controls (ages 12-18) with SPM8 two-sample t test,
clusterwise corrected for searching the whole brain. Results: CD adolescents had significantly lower clusters of FA in 9 tracts. In the right posterior temporal lobe, this included the inferior front-occipital fasiculus,
posterior thalamic radiation, and sagittal stratum. CD deficits were also
present in the genu and body of the corpus callosum, internal capsule,
cerebellar peduncles and midbrain. Conclusion: As hypothesized, fractional anisotropy was found to be decreased in pure CD adolescents in
the temporal lobe as well as numerous other major white matter tracts.
The results support theories that frontotemporal brain dysfunction contributes to antisocial behavior disorder risk. This study indicates that
abnormalities in the major white matter connective media among brain

regions are more prevalent than previous evidence from volumetricbased studies would suggest.

EFFECTS OF PERINATAL BRAIN INJURY ON WHITE MATTER TRACT
DEVELOPMENT EXAMINED WITH DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING
Pamela Moses1, Shauna Geraghty2, Ruth Carper3; 1San Diego State University,

PGSP-Stanford PsyD Consortium, 3University of California, San Diego — Chil-

dren who sustain focal injury to the brain during perinatal development
show resilience in their subsequent cognitive development. This resilience suggests plastic changes and alternative patterns of development
in the intact white matter to support ongoing cognitive development.
The purpose of this study was to examine the structural integrity of
major white matter tracts in individuals with unilateral perinatal lesions
(PL) to determine whether there are alterations following early injury.
Six teenagers and young adults with PL caused by stroke or white matter
injury and twenty-two matched controls were examined using diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI). Bilateral measurements of fractional anisotropy
(FA) were taken in regions of interest in the major tracts including the
corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal
fasciculus, inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus and the
corpus callosum. Comparisons of FA values between the PL and control
groups showed lower FA values in the PL group in multiple tracts
within the lesioned hemisphere. This is indicative of disruption or
maldevelopment of those tracts. Effects of the lesion were also seen as
reduced FA values beyond the injured hemisphere in the corpus callosum and superior longitudinal fasciculus of the uninjured hemisphere.
In sum, DTI analysis reveals alterations in the development of white
matter following an early injury. The measures of FA suggest site-specific attenuation of the white matter, rather than evidence for compensatory growth in the remaining tracts, even in intact regions previously
thought to be spared by the lesions.

MINDFULNESS DISPOSITION IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED
CORTICAL THICKNESS IN OLDER ADULTS Daniel Snider1, Arthur F.

Kramer2, Ruchika Shaurya Prakash1; 1Deparment of Psychology, The Ohio
State University, 2Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology,
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign — Aging is associated with global
cortical thinning, with morphological changes most pronounced in the
prefrontal cortex. Previous research has demonstrated that lifestyle factors can significantly reduce the cortical atrophy associated with aging.
Mindfulness disposition, a trait characteristic that describes the tendency
to be mindful or aware at the present moment, has recently been found
to have emotional and cognitive benefits for long-term practitioners of
meditation and young adults. In this study, we examined if mindfulness
disposition was associated with reduced age-related thinning of the cortex in community-dwelling older adults. Twenty-nine younger and
twenty-eight older adults were administered the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire to assess mindfulness disposition, and high-resolution T1 images were collected to examine cortical thickness. Whole-head,
surface-based morphometry analyses were performed to examine if
higher levels of mindfulness disposition were associated with increased
cortical thickness for older adults. A direct comparison of young and old
participants revealed widespread cortical thinning in the older cohort,
with particular reductions in the prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, consistent with previous research. We also found that mindfulness
disposition was related to increased cortical thickness of the left superior
frontal gyrus, medial orbital frontal cortex, left middle frontal gyrus, and
the right inferior parietal lobule. These results suggest that mindfulness
disposition may be an important factor in maintaining structural integrity of the brain and possibly prevent age-related cognitive decline. Further research investigating the effects of mindfulness training will help
conclusively demonstrate the relationship between mindfulness and cortical thickness.

A FUNCTIONAL POLYMORPHISM IN ESTROGEN SYNTHESIS IS
ACCOCIATED WITH RIGHT HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME IN HEALTHY YOUNG
MEN Janine Bayer1, Ulrike Schwarze1, Gabriele Rune1, Christian Buechel1,
Tobias Sommer1; 1University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf — Estra-

diol, as a prominent neurosteroid, is de novo synthesized in particular in
the hippocampus. In addition to the well known functions in the reproductive system, neuroprotective and synaptogenetic effects of estrogen
on hippocampal neurons have been observed. These functions of estrogen on the cellular level are in agreement with reports about fluctuations
in memory performance, hippocampal activity and hippocampal size
across the menstrual cycle. The conversion of testosterone to 17-beta
estradiol, the most important estrogen, is catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase . A common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the
gene for aromatase, i.e. CYP19, has been linked to differences in the
serum estradiol levels in men. In the present study, we explored whether
variations in this SNP are associated with hippocampal neuroanatomical
differences in healthy young men. We performed voxel-based morphometry on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 94 men (aged
18 - 46; mean age: 26) acquired by a 3T MR scanner. Age and the genotype in a SNP of the BDNF-gene (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) was
used as covariates because both factors correlate with hippocampal size.
In line with our hypothesis, we found that the more efficient aromatase
allele was associated with greater volume of the hippocampus in an
allele-dose-dependent fashion. In conclusion, higher levels of estradiol
might lead via its neuroprotective and synaptogenetic functions to
greater hippocampal volume.

CROSS-METHOD COMPARISONS GENERATE NEW HYPOTHESES IN
COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE Nicholas C. Hindy1, H. Branch Coslett1,
Sharon L. Thompson-Schill1; 1University of Pennsylvania — Patient

lesion
studies, functional imaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) are powerful tools for discovering structure-function relationships in the brain. While we expect converging evidence from studies
using different methodologies, this is often not the case. However, in
accord with strong within-method citation biases (Fellows et al., 2005),
much diverging evidence across methods goes unaccounted. When
diverging cross-method evidence is cited, these differences are generally
dismissed as due to minor variations in the procedures and task
demands of the experiments. We outline four instances in which nearly
identical tasks and procedures were employed in studies that used either
patient lesion analysis, functional imaging, or TMS. Common tasks
include particular versions of the recent probes task, line bisection task,
temporal discrimination task, and anti-saccade task. In two instances,
separate studies using different methods lead to similar functional-anatomical inferences. In the other two instances, conclusions made in different studies appear to contradict one another. To reconcile diverging
conclusions, we examine inferential considerations specific to each
method, and discuss evidence in the context of a recently developed
framework for specifying cognitive ontologies (Price & Friston, 2005).
Through the multiple-case-study approach, hypotheses arise that were
not anticipated by data from any one method. We emphasize the utility
of cross-method comparisons made possible only by using the same
experimental procedure across paradigms.

Center, University of Pittsburgh, 3Department of Psychology, University of

specific regions within the basal ganglia that receive projections from
distinct cortical and subcortical sites. While some of these projection
topographies have been mapped in vivo using diffusion tensor imaging

102

(e.g., frontal, limbic, motor) little is known about the microstructural
topographies of these fiber projections in humans (e.g., somatotopic
organization of fibers from motor cortex). We used a combination of
high angular resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), generalized
q-ball imaging (GQI) reconstruction, and region-of-interest based deterministic tractography to produce maps of the cortical projections into the
basal ganglia at a sub-millimeter resolution. Fiber streamlines were
tracked from a collection of anatomically distinct regions throughout the
neocortex. Across subjects (N=8), a consistent topographic organization
was observed for cortical projections into the caudate and putamen. The
spatial arrangement of these projection fields was consistent with previous histological findings in non-human primates. Within these macroscopic projection fields, we were also able to detect consistent
microstructural topographies. For example fiber projections from motor
and somatosensory areas were organized in a somatotopic manner,
while prefrontal projections were segregated into several distinct subfields. These microscopic topographies can yield valuable clues as to the
relevant computational units of the different segments of the basal ganglia, as well as provide more sensitive tools for identifying basal ganglia
dysfunction in clinical neurological populations.

and Development Center, 2Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition,
3Department of Psychology University of Pittsburgh, 4Department of
Neurosurgery University of Pittsburgh Medical Center — We describe High
Density Fiber Tracking (HDFT) Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) to
produce high resolution images of fiber tracts to reliably follow the tracts
through crossings to the cortex. Most previous techniques have poor
ability (<10%) to tract fibers through double and triple crossings. Our
HDFT can reliably track fibers to cortex, show the shape morphology of
the contact surface of the cortex, show clear gyral patterns, and allow
quantification of the tract volume and integrity. We utilize the techniques in an advisory capacity to evaluate neurosurgical and traumatic
brain injury cases. In neurosurgery the methods have been examined in
over twenty patients and in the majority of cases the information was
viewed as valuable to plan the approach and in a third influenced to procedure. HDFT methods provided historic first real-time use of HDFT to
visualize fiber tracts in the operating room to guide surgery during
tumor removal and enabled quantification of surgery-induced fiber
damage. In Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) cases we detected and quantified substantial fiber breakage using HDFT finding breakage that could
not/was not detected by current CT or MRI methods. We have detected
very high breakage rates (>50%) in TBI patients where normal control
subjects typically showed low breakage rates (<5%) and were traditional
imaging methods could not detect the breaks.

and visuo-motor symptoms reflecting widespread posterior cerebral
dysfunction. Methods: Cognitive and structural and diffusion tensor
(DT)-MRI data were collected from seven PCA patients. Using DT-MRI
tractography, bilateral inferior longitudinal (ILF), inferior fronto-occipital (IFOF), arcuate, and fronto-parietal superior longitudinal (SLF) fasciculi were obtained in patients and 13 healthy controls (HC). Corpus
callosum (CC) and cortico-spinal tracts (CST) were also studied. From
each tract, mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as
axial and radial diffusivity (D) were obtained. Grey (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy was assessed using voxel-based morphometry.
Results: PCA patients showed a clinical syndrome mainly characterized
by visual agnosia and prosopagnosia. Compared with HC, patients had
significantly higher MD, axial D, and radial D, and lower FA in left ILF
and IFOF; higher MD and radial D and lower FA in right ILF, and higher
MD in CC. Fronto-parietal SLF, arcuate fasciculus, and CST were spared,
bilaterally. PCA showed GM atrophy in posterior bilateral temporal,
inferior parietal and occipital cortices, and WM atrophy in the bilateral
ventral occipito-temporal regions. Conclusions:PCA patients showed
damage to the ventral visual WM pathways of both hemispheres, with
relative sparing of dorsal fronto-parietal connections. Accordingly, the
patients showed mainly deficits on recognizing faces and objects. These
results contribute to our understanding of the network changes in PCA
and to explain the different phenotypes of the syndrome.

Steffensen1, Bruce Brown1; 1Brigham Young University — As
event-related
potentials (ERPs) can reflect individual differences in intellectual ability,
individual differences in college grade-point average (GPA) may be
associated with specific components of the ERP waveform, such as the
P300. In this regard, our objective was to determine whether differences
in GPA are reflected in ERPs while controlling for gender and menstrual
phase. We obtained GPAs from 22 right-handed college students (11
male, age range 22 to 26 and 11 female, age range 17 to 24) at a university
with high admission and retention standards. We assessed menstrual
phase by measuring luteinizing hormone levels across the cycle and
obtained ERPs with a 64 channel EEG system for each male participant
and ERPs during each phase of the menstrual cycle for each female participant in an object-recognition visual pop-out protocol using Net Station (Electrical Geodesics, Inc., Eugene, Oregon) and E-prime
(Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania) software.
High GPA (4.0) in females and males was associated with a positive peak
at approximately 689 ms that was not present in males or was significantly diminished in females in the low-GPA (<2.0) group. Electrocortical processing of cognitive stimuli may differ between college students
with high and low GPAs.

EARLY CORRELATES OF WORD RECOGNITION IN FIXATION-RELATED AND
EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS: A COMPARISON USING SIMULTANEOUS
EYE TRACKING AND EEG Olaf Dimigen1,2, Michael Dambacher2,3, Werner

Sommer1, Reinhold Kliegl2, Arthur Jacobs3, Olaf Hauk4; 1Humboldt Universität
zu Berlin, 2Universität Potsdam, 3Freie Universität Berlin, 4MRC CBU,
Cambridge — Electrophysiological correlates of visual word recognition
have typically been studied with single-word paradigms, or using wordby-word presentation (RSVP). An alternative approach to study word
recognition under more natural conditions is to record fixation-related
potentials (FRPs) time-locked to individual fixations during saccadic
reading. While previous research has demonstrated the feasibility of this
approach, existing FRP studies have focused on late and comparatively
easy-to-measure components in the N400 latency range. The goal of the
present study was to test for early effects of word frequency in FRPs and
to compare their timing to effects in conventional event-related potentials (ERPs). Eye movements and EEG were simultaneously recorded
while participants read lists of unrelated German nouns, which varied in
word frequency. In half of the trials, participants read the lists in a normal, left-to-right fashion. In the other half, lists were presented in RSVP
at a pace matched to reading speed in the FRP condition. To control for
influences of correlated word properties (e.g. length) and oculomotor
behavior, linear mixed models (LMMs) were specified for each sampling

104

point of the event-related EEG. Word frequency modulated fixation
duration and had two temporally separable effects in the FRP: One peaking at 550 ms after fixation onset, and one around 200 ms, that is, during
the duration of the first fixation. Both effects were replicated with traditional RSVP presentation. Results suggest that it is feasible to identify
early EEG correlates of lexical processing under natural reading conditions, allowing direct comparisons between EEG measures and fixation
time.

EFFECT OF INTENSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON TIME PERCEPTION AND
EEG Irina Polikanova1, Olga Sysoeva1,2, Alexander Tonevitsky1; 1Moscow

State University, Moscow, Russia, 2Washington University School of Medicine,
St Louis, MO — The goal of the study was to examine the effect of intense

physical activity on time perception and resting EEG. Nine male student-wrestlers (mean age 19+/-1) perform short block of tests including
subjective assessment of their current state (health, activity and mood
questionnaire), Spielberg state and trait anxiety questionnaire, reaction
time tests and 3 types of tapping: comfort (press the “space” button at
any comfortable rate), maximal (press the “space” button with maximal
speed), subjective second (press the “space” button each second. This
block was performed in the baseline condition and within 15-30 minutes
after the intense physical exercise (combat wresting training with the
mean heart rate HR 159?7). Before each block the resting EEG (256 channels) was recorded. Significant increase on subjective assessment of
activity (4.6 vs 5.3, t(9)=3.1, p=0.01) and decrease in subjective second(1223 vs 1027, t(9)=2,7, p=0.03 ) were found after the physical exercise compared to baseline condition. The differences in these parameters
showed significant correlation (r= -0.69, p=0.04), indicating that degree
of increased subjective assessment of activity is related to degree of decrement in subjective second. Significant correlationwas found between
subjective second and individual alpha frequency (IAF) in occipital
region in the baseline condition (r = 0.78, p=0.12). The study showed that
intense physical activitychanges the subjective perception of time and
this changes correlates with changes in self-assessed activity. The relationship of this phenomenon with parameters of peripheral and central
nervous system will be discussed.

ENHANCEMENT OF HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY IN
NEUROGRANIN NULL MICE BY PHORBOL ESTER Freesia Huang1, Kuo-

Ping Huang1; 1Developmental Neurobiology Program, NICHD, NIH — Neurog-

ranin (Ng) is a brain-specific, postsynaptic, apo-calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein, which has been shown to enhance synaptic plasticity
through increasing Ca2+ transients. In vitro, Ng is a specific substrate of
protein kinase C (PKC) and the phosphorylated Ng exhibits lower affinity for CaM. Deletion of Ng in mice (NgKO) causes deficits in learning
and memory and the high frequency stimulation (HFS)-mediated longterm potentiation (LTP). Previously, we showed that environmental
enrichment could not improve cognitive behavior or LTP of these
mutant mice. Using acute hippocampal slices, we showed here that
PDBu caused a dose-dependent facilitation in CA1 region of hippocampus, optimally at 4-8 µM and lasted more than 2h. The facilitation (LTF)

Sunday, April 3, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session D
was not inhibited by APV, KN93, U0126 or anisomycin, suggesting that
the phorbol ester/ LTF was not mediated through NMDA receptor,
CaMKII or MEK and didn’t require new protein synthesis. The facilitation was retarded by PKC inhibitor, and its effect was less pronounced
once the LTF was established. The phorbol ester/LTF was more effective
in the slices from the dorsal than from the ventral hippocampus. The
extent of facilitation in NgKO was comparable to those of the wild type
mice, though, the KO mice clearly display deficit in tetanus-mediated
LTP. It seemed that the phorbol ester/LTF was mediated by a pre-synaptic mechanism not involving Ng/CaM interaction at postsynaptic sites.
These findings suggested the possibility of using PKC activator for
enhancing the hippocampal synaptic plasticity and providing therapeutic guidance for correcting the behavioral abnormalities of these NgKO
mice.

FREELY AVAILABLE MATLAB SOFTWARE FOR MASS UNIVARIATE
ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS David

M. Groppe1, Thomas P. Urbach1, Marta Kutas1; 1University of California, San
Diego — Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are typically analyzed via
ANOVAs on mean voltages across a priori defined time windows.
Advances in computing power and statistics have made possible an
alternative -- mass univariate analyses consisting of thousands of
univariate statistical tests (e.g., a t-test at each electrode and time point
from 100 to 900 ms post-stimulus) with savvy corrections for multiple
comparisons (e.g., control of the false discovery rate). Relative to conventional ANOVAs, mass univariate analyses have the advantage of weaker
assumptions about when and where effects occur and provide greater
temporal and spatial resolution. Thus, this approach is much better at
addressing questions as to when effects begin and may reveal unexpected effects missed by a priori time windows. While these benefits
come at the cost of some loss of statistical power, the power that remains
may often be more than adequate. Thus, mass univariate analyses are a
valuable complement to and, in some cases, may obviate the need for
conventional analyses (indeed mass univariate analyses are commonly
used in fMRI research). Here we illustrate how two savvy corrections for
multiple comparisons (permutation-based control of the family-wise
error rate and false discovery rate control), summarize their pros and
cons, and explicitly show that they provide an unconventional window
on ERPs at times revealing unexpected effects. We also present a freely
available set of Matlab functions (compatible with EEGLAB and
ERPLAB) for performing such analyses on ERP data and for visualizing
their results.

FREE VIEWING OF EMOTIONAL IMAGES: EVIDENCE FROM
SIMULTANEOUS EYE MOVEMENT AND EEG RESPONSES Jaana

Simola1,2, Jari Torniainen1, Mona Moisala1, Teemu Peltonen1, Markus
Kivikangas2, Christina Krause1; 1University of Helsinki, 2Aalto University —
Processing of emotional visual stimuli modulates the EEG (electroencephalography) brain oscillatory responses in the 4 – 6 Hz frequency
range. In the current study, we recorded EEG and eye movements simultaneously from 11 right-handed participants while they viewed images
with varying emotional valence (International Affective Picture System,
IAPS). Sets of four images were presented either serially or simultaneously. An ‘emotional’ image set included one image of high positive
or high negative valence among neutral images. A ‘neutral’ set comprised of four neutral images. After having seen a four–image set, the
participants indicated which picture - if any - was emotional and rated
the selected image on the valence and arousal dimensions (self assessment manikin scale, SAM). In the free viewing condition, the same sets
of four images were presented simultaneously on the screen, and the
brain oscillatory EEG responses were analyzed time-locked to the eye
fixations on an emotional image. This experimental setting allowed for
direct comparisons between the serial and free viewing conditions. The
results from both presentation conditions showed greater brain oscillatory EEG responses in the 4 – 6 Hz frequency range for the negative as

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

compared to the neutral images. However, the effect was somewhat
more prominent in the serial presentation condition. From a methodological viewpoint the results show that analyzing brain oscillatory EEG
responses time-locked to the eye fixations on a specific target image is a
valid technique to assess brain oscillatory responses related and triggered by natural sequence of perceptual events (free viewing of images).

P300 VS. FRONTAL POSITIVITY FOR BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE
SPELLER CLASSIFICATION Matthew Miller1, Siri Kamp1, Emanuel
Donchin1; 1University of South Florida — The goals of this study were (1) to

investigate the component structure of the event-related potential (ERP)
elicited in the P300 based brain computer interface (BCI; Farwell and
Donchin, 1988) and (2) to compare classification accuracy when the
selection was based on individual components. A principal component
analysis (PCA) revealed two major ERP components that distinguished
between flashes of target and non-target rows and columns. As
expected, target flashes elicited a parietally-distributed P300 component.
In addition, the PCA revealed an earlier frontal positivity peaking
around 250ms after the target flash. We generated two linear discriminant functions, each on the virtual ERPs of each spatial factor. Using
these discriminant functions for offline classification, we found that both
components successfully discriminated between target and non-target
flashes in the oddball paradigm implemented in the P300-based BCI.
Classification based on the frontal component lead to higher discrimination accuracy than classification accuracy based on the parietal P300.
When the P300 was used for classification, trials incorrectly selected as
targets showed a waveform that was comparable to target trials, containing a strong P300. This indicates that erroneous selections were due to
non-target flashes eliciting a P300 component for some trials. When classification was based on the frontal positivity, incorrectly selected trials
did not elicit a larger frontal component that targets, indicating that erroneous decisions were caused by other factors, such as high background
noise. Frontal accuracy was greater, indicating that BCI accuracy may be
improved by looking at patterns of ERP activity rather than singular
components.

THE EFFECTS OF A SELF-EVALUATION TASK ON THE P300 EVENT
RELATED POTENTIAL Tyler Grindstaff1, Justin Karr1, Joel Alexander1,

Ronald Alexander2; 1Western Oregon University, 2Wartburg College — It has
been shown that P300 amplitude is sensitive to self-identity stimuli (e.g.,
name) and emotional self-evaluation (Alexander, et al., 2005). The
present study is a replication of the Alexander et al. 2005 study with
more electrode locations and participants. The study was designed to
capture an introspective moment during a task that required emotional
self-evaluation related to an infrequent, random stimulus void of selfidentity qualities. The design of the study was different from previous
stimulus-driven self-identity stimulus studies in that the base sensory
discrimination task was constant across all conditions. Participants
started with a standard tone discrimination task (oddball) during condition 1. In conditions 2 and 3 participants completed a secondary cognitive task in addition to the oddball task where they made a second
stimulus-related judgment after their initial response. Condition 2
required subjects to index a mental count if the tone was a target, in
addition to oddball. Condition 3 required subjects to self evaluate it they
were surprised by the occurrence of the target, given the random/infrequent nature of the target tone presentation. During these conditions,
ERPs were recorded across 32 electrode sites. Similar to the self-identity
stimulus studies, results indicated a large increase in P300 amplitude
during the condition with the self-evaluation component compared to
the other conditions. The increase in recording sites allowed for the
delineation of the Parietal lobe being the location of the greatest increase
in P300 Amplitude. These results imply that self-evaluation may utilize
more cortical resources than non-self related cognitive-discrimination
tasks.

UNSUPERVISED BRAIN PARCELLATION FROM FUNCTIONAL
NEUROIMAGING DATA Michael Hanke1,2, Yaroslav O. Halchenko1, James

V. Haxby1; 1Dartmouth College, 2Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg —
Recent findings from multivariate pattern (MVP) classification of neural
data have shown the potential of these algorithms. Consequently, they
are increasingly often employed to investigate information encoding in
certain areas of the brain. However, in the vast majority of studies region
of interest (ROI) selection is still based on univariate localizer contrasts
or hand-drawn anatomical masks. While the former might suffer from
limitations of the employed statistical methods or data smoothing
requirements, the latter doesn't account for inter-subject variability in the
functional organisation of the brain. To address these problems and
allow for multivariate ROI generation beyond the scope of existing localizer paradigms (e.g. retinotopic mapping, fusiform face area) we propose an independent component analysis (ICA) based parcellation
strategy in combination with a rich multi-modal stimulus (a featurelength movie) paradigm. We investigate the utility of several algorithm
variants regarding the identification of homologous areas in a functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset across multiple subjects
throughout the whole brain. This includes cross-subject matching of
individual ICA components and multi-criterion (anatomical and functional) alignment to group template, as well as application of multi-subject ICA analyses. We demonstrate that this unsupervised method can be
used to derive common ROIs across multiple subjects that account for
both anatomical and functional properties of individual brains. These
ROIs can be used, for example, to streamline MVP group analysis and
aid in situations where a voxel-to-voxel correspondence across subject
datasets cannot be achieved and negatively impacts results (e.g. a searchlight analysis).

LOCATING CORTICAL COMPUTATION USING SIGNAL CORRELATION
TECHNIQUES IN MAGNETOENCEPHALO-GRAPHY Andrew
Thwaites1,

Paula Buttery2, Ian Nimmo-Smith1, William Marslen-Wilson1; 1The MRC
Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, 2University of Cambridge — The brain pro-

cesses information about the world in largely unknown ways. How can
we determine what these processes are? The field of cognitive neuroscience has made partial progress on this difficult task, but it is only with
the recent advent of cognitively plausible models of computation from
the field of artificial intelligence that testing for the existence of complex
deterministic functions using brain imaging data can start in earnest. We
construct a new method which uses high temporal resolution electrophysiological imaging techniques such as electroencephalography and
magnetoencephalography to obtain evidence about the existence of specific computational processes in the cortex. The method operates by
matching localised patterns of neural activity with the activity pattern
derived from the hypothesised process. This gives the location (in a
source-space reconstruction of the cortex) and timings of the processes of
interest (measured in milliseconds, relative to the stimulus onset). We
test this method on various auditory processes including pitch and
intensity. Preliminary results suggest that an intensity process starts
bilaterally in Heschl’s gyrus 85ms after sound onset, with change-inintensity at the same place at 130ms, while a change-in-pitch-related process can be detected bilaterally in auditory cortex at 45ms. Current work
is extending this technique to higher-order aspects of cortical computation.

SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN NETWORKS INVOLVED IN
SOURCE MONITORING AS IDENTIFIED BY CPCA AND ICA Paul

Metzak1,2, Todd Woodward1,2; 1University of British Columbia, 2BC Mental
Health and Addictions Research Institute — In the current study, we sought
to investigate the neural networks that underlie successful contextual

106

memory performance. While undergoing function MRI scanning, 21
healthy controls performed the recall portion of a contextual memory
task in which they were asked to indicate which of four operations they
had previously performed while encoding each word (reading, hearing,
semantically associating, or unscrambling letters). The data was analyzed using two separate multivariate fMRI analysis packages: CPCA
(http://www.nitrc.org/projects/fmricpca/),
and
ICA
(http://
icatb.sourceforge.net/). For the CPCA analysis, components were
selected on the amount of variance explained, whereas for the ICA analysis, components were selected on the basis of the R-square value
obtained from regressing the ICA component activity time courses on
the design matrix used to conduct the CPCA analysis. The results indicated a wide overlap between the two methods in terms of the brain
regions identified as being activated/deactivated during the performance of this task, which implies that they were converging on a common signal in the data. These areas included the dorsal anterior
cingulate, insula, and occipital cortices. However, there were differences
in the between the methods in terms of how these regions were organized into functionally connected networks, as well as in the estimate of
the activity levels in these functional networks in the various experimental conditions.

EVIDENCE FOR A DOSE-SENSITIVE RESPONSE TO FMR1 GENE
EXPRESSION IN THE FRONTO-PARIETAL CORTEX FOR THE NUMERICAL
PROCESSING So-Yeon Kim1, Ryu-ichiro Hashimoto2, Tony J. Simon1, Susan

M. Rivera1; 1University of California, Davis, 2Showa University School of
Medicine, Tokyo — Mutations of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)

gene are the genetic cause of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of mental retardation. Hypermethylation of the
FMR1 promoter region, along with repeat expansion, results in deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), ultimately causing cognitive impairments. Patients with partial methylation or patients with a
mixture of full and premutation cells may have some FMRP expression,
resulting in a less severe phenotype (i.e. FX mosaicism). Using fMRI, we
examined whether the cognitive deficits associated with fronto-parietal
brain functions is sensitive to FMRP level. We recruited adults on the FX
spectrum, including females with FXS and males and females with FX
mosaicism, and tested the effect of FMRP on numerical processing using
a magnitude estimation task. During the task, participants saw side-byside displays of sets of rectangles and were asked to indicate the set containing more objects. Numbers of objects in the sets differed by 1-3
(“small”) or 5-7 (“large”). The "distance effect" on cortical activations
was estimated by comparing activation between the “small” and “large”
conditions. The results showed that neurotypical adults and FX participants showed equivalent task performance; however, distance effects on
activation in the IPS, IPL, and DLPFC were significantly reduced in the
FX group. Interestingly, regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between the fronto-parietal activation and CGG repeat size.
Together, these results suggest a dosage response of FMR1 gene expression on the numerical functions in the prefrontal-parietal regions in FXS.

IDENTIFYING FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS THAT GIVE RISE TO INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY USING ICA Craig Bennett1, Michael Miller1;
1University of California, Santa Barbara — Individual

differences in regional
brain activity are a critical area of research in the struggle to understand
the human brain. Recently, Miller et al. (2002) have used a whole-brain
correlation technique to investigate inter-individual variability in fMRI
results. The question that we sought to answer was whether the wholebrain inter-individual differences observed using Miller’s cross-correlation approach could be localized to specific functional networks within
the brain. To investigate this question we acquired fMRI data from 22
participants on an old/new episodic word recognition task. Subjects
reported whether each displayed word was old (previously seen during
encoding) or new (the first time seen). All preprocessing and modeling
of the fMRI data was completed using SPM5. We then conducted the

standard Miller cross-correlation analysis to quantify inter-individual
variability in the task>rest contrast across subjects. To investigate functional networks we used an independent components analysis (ICA)
approach. We used the MELODIC toolbox from the FSL software suite to
perform a joint tensor-ICA decomposition of the entire dataset. There
were 146 components that resulted from this analysis. An analysis of the
component timecourses using the FEAT toolbox revealed that 56 of these
components had activity that was significantly related to the task. The
subject/session mode from a subset of 14 components was significantly
correlated (r = 0.32 to 0.45) with the inter-individual variability in the
whole-brain results using the Miller approach. We conclude that the
variability in specific functional networks gives rise to the overall pattern
of inter-individual differences present in fMRI results.

LARGE-SCALE AUTOMATED DECODING OF HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY Tal

Yarkoni1, Russell Poldrack2, Thomas Nichols3, David Van Essen4, Tor Wager1;
University of Colorado at Boulder, 2University of Texas at Austin, 3University of
Warwick, 4Washington University School of Medicine — A central goal of
1

human neuroimaging research is to map relationships between mind
and brain, enabling decoding of cognitive states from brain activity. Previous decoding approaches have focused on discriminating between
narrow sets of alternative states, overlooking the vast range of cognitive
states human beings can experience. Here we introduce a novel brain
mapping approach that uses text mining and meta-analysis to produce
accurate mappings between brain activity and a large number of cognitive states. Using automated coordinate extraction software, we generated a database of 122,627 activation foci drawn from 3,617 published
neuroimaging studies. Validation analyses verified the accuracy of this
approach, with 84% sensitivity and 97% specificity compared to a manually-coded reference database. We used the resulting database to (a)
automatically produce whole-brain meta-analysis maps for over 200 distinct psychological concepts; (b) generate ‘reverse inference’ maps quantifying the likelihood of specific psychological processes given observed
activation patterns; and (c) accurately decode cognitive states in individual subjects based purely on prior literature and without any training on
subject-level data. Collectively, these results validate a novel approach to
the long-standing problem of reverse inference in brain imaging and represent a substantial step towards open-ended decoding of human brain
activity.

USING RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY TO EXPLORE THE
HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION OF PREFRONTAL CORTEX Lisa Ankeny1,
Jeremy Reynolds1, Jessica Andrews-Hanna2; 1University of Denver, 2University
of Colorado — Experimental data suggest that a network of areas within

prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlie behavior on complex tasks (Badre &
D’Esposito, 2007). Specifically, these areas correspond to dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), anterior dorsal premotor cortex (prePMd), inferior
frontal sulcus (IFS) and anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). Previous
approaches have argued for hierarchical interactions among these
regions whereby anterior areas of PFC influence more posterior areas.
However, there have been limited attempts to directly investigate this
pattern of connectivity in human subjects. The current study used resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to investigate this proposed pattern. First, we explored whether the network of areas above is
spontaneously correlated at rest. Results indicated that 1) the prePMd,
IFS, and aPFC were significantly positively correlated with each other
and 2) none of these regions were strongly associated with the PMd. Second, we investigated whether the correlations between areas could be
characterized as direct or indirect using statistical mediation techniques.
Correlation patterns indicated both direct and indirect relationships,
such that the area of IFS partially mediated the correlation between areas
of aPFC and prePMd, consistent with work examining the anatomic connectivity among areas within PFC in macaque monkeys (Petrides & Pandya, 2007). These data suggest that even in the absence of a goal-directed
motor task, three anterior PFC areas interact in a systematic manner.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

However, consistent with some prior results (Vincent et al., 2008), these
areas appear to be distinct from a posterior network including the PMd.

the human mirror system, allowing us to predict actions and possibly
learn new actions. However, direct measures of ongoing action simulation are hard to obtain. The present study explores the role of eye movements as an implicit and online measure of action simulation.
Participants viewed predictable sequences of natural, goal-directed
actions which were occluded for a two second period. Following occlusion, the action sequence reappeared at three levels of temporal asynchrony. Participants were instructed to imagine the continuation of the
action during the occlusion period and to make a judgement about the
temporal coherence of the sequence. During natural viewing and occlusion, eye movements were recorded. Significant correlations between
eye movements during natural viewing and during occlusion are
reported. This suggests that eye movements continue to track an action
during occlusion, indicating ongoing action simulation in this period.
Moreover, initial results indicate that stronger eye movement correlations across participants predicted better behavioural performance. Further work should assess the functional role of these eye movements for
accurate action prediction.

INFORMATIONAL CONNECTIVITY: A NOVEL FMRI ANALYSIS METHOD FOR
IDENTIFYING BRAIN AREAS THAT SHARE DISTRIBUTED ENCODING
PRINCIPLES Marc N. Coutanche1, Sharon L. Thompson-Schill1; 1University
of Pennsylvania — The past decade of fMRI data analyses has led to the
advent of two new classes of analytic tools for understanding the functional architecture of the brain. One such method, multi-voxel pattern
107

Poster Session D — Sunday, April 3, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
analysis (MVPA), has been utilized to decode distributed patterns at the
across-voxel level. Another, functional connectivity, measures activation
synchrony between anatomically-distant regions to detect functional
networks. Here, we describe a novel technique that combines both methods to discover networks of regions that share related approaches to representing classes of stimuli or cognitions. We have developed a metric
that quantifies the distance between the patterns of class-confusability
found for different regions. By incorporating this measure into a roaming searchlight procedure, we are able to map the groups of brain areas
that share information-processing principles. We have applied this technique to an existing fMRI dataset recorded during presentations of
images of exemplars from eight semantic categories. The results identify
a selective set of regions that differs from groupings obtained with existing functional connectivity techniques. The regions detected with the
method vary based on the location of the seed region, suggesting sensitivity to information processing differences in regions of interest. By
selecting a hypothesis-driven seed region, this technique can be used to
move beyond the question of which areas are concurrently functionally
active, to which areas process stimuli, or engage in cognitive processes,
in a related manner.

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION TO PREFRONTAL
CORTEX ALTERS BLOOD FLOW AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN
REWARD NETWORKS Matthew Weber1, Samuel Messing1, Hengyi Rao1,

David Wolk1, John Detre1, Sharon Thompson-Schill1; 1University of
Pennsylvania — Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method

of noninvasive brain stimulation that has grown much more popular in
recent years, but little is known about its effects on human neurophysiology, especially at sites distal to the stimulated tissue. Additionally,
almost all imaging work to date has focused on stimulation of primary
motor cortex. To examine the effects of tDCS to prefrontal cortex, we
scanned subjects with conventional BOLD fMRI and arterial spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion fMRI before and after tDCS over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). ASL scans measured resting cerebral blood flow
(CBF); BOLD scans measured activity during the Balloon Analog Risk
Task, which activates DLPFC (Rao et al., 2008) and is responsive to tDCS
over DLPFC, with stimulated subjects showing greater risk aversion
(Fecteau et al., 2007). We observed post-tDCS reductions of CBF in
DLPFC and orbitofrontal cortex, as well as reductions of task-related
BOLD activity in insula and striatum. TDCS also altered functional connectivity between the stimulation sites and several other reward-related
regions including insula, striatum, and cingulate cortices. This work elucidates the neurophysiological changes caused by prefrontal tDCS and
strongly suggests that stimulation to DLPFC alters the subject's assessment of risk and reward through its effect on downstream sites.

University of Pittsburgh — Histological studies on nonhuman primate and
postmortem human brains have shown a highly detailed topography of
commissural fibers that has yet to be fully visualized in vivo. This is due
to the inability of current diffusion imaging methods to navigate regions
where callosal fibers cross with other major cortical tracts, causing whole
brain tracking approaches to fail at detecting lateral projections to areas
of the parietal and temporal lobes where fibers are known to exist. To
this end, we used generalized Q-ball imaging (GQI) reconstruction on
high angular resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) data (257
direction, TR = 9916 ms, TE = 157 ms, voxel size = 2.4 x 2.4 x 2.4 mm3,
FoV = 231 x 231 mm, b-max = 7000 s/mm2) to model the detailed directional information in white matter pathways. By combining whole brain
and local region-of-interest based seeding and then applying deterministic tractography methods, we were able to render a complete map of callosal projections to specific cortical and subcortical targets where
commissural fibers are expected to terminate. This approach yielded a
well-defined topography of parietal and temporal cortical endpoints that

108

was not visualized strictly using a whole brain tractography method
through the corpus callosum. Furthermore, connectivity analysis across
8 subjects revealed enhanced connectivity structure of caudal cortical
regions using this combined method. These results indicate that GQI
combined with local seeding compensates for the loss in detection of
fiber projections to specific cortical regions due to intricate fiber crossings.

VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY IDENTIFIES SMALLER GRAY MATTER
VOLUMES IN ADOLESCENT DRINKERS Jessica Pommy1, Mollie Monnig1,

Per Lysne1, Ronald Yeo1, Michael Bogenschutz1, Robert Thoma1; 1University of
New Mexico — Chronic alcohol use disorders (AUD) in adults are associated with smaller gray matter (GM) volumes in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The neurodegenerative effects of ethanol on
the developing brain, however, are not as well understood. It was
hypothesized that regional cortical abnormalities in adolescents with an
AUD could be identified relative to healthy, normal controls. GM volumes were assessed in 7 adolescents diagnosed with an AUD and 12
healthy, non-drinking adolescents. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM), a
neuroimaging analysis technique, was used to provide a comprehensive,
unbiased comparison of gray matter (GM) volumes between the two
groups at baseline and at a one year follow-up. A VBM multiple regression analysis identified associations between an AUD diagnosis and GM
volume. Preliminary results indicate regions of smaller GM volume in
the AUD group relative to controls, at both time points. At baseline, the
neocortical effects were greatest in the right inferior temporal gyrus, left
and right superior occipital gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, left
precuneus, and right middle gyrus. At a one year follow-up, the greatest
effects were identified in the right inferior temporal gyrus, left inferior
frontal gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, right cerebellum, and right
inferior occipital gyrus. These results, though preliminary, indicate
smaller GM volumes in adolescents diagnosed with an AUD at both time
points, and potentially suggest different patterns of cortical development in adolescents with AUD.

THE WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA PATIENT REGISTRY: A NEW RESOURCE
FOR NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH Julie Fiez1, Denise Balason1,

Rupa Ramaswamy1, Fissell Catherine1, Behrmann Marlene2; 1Dept. of
Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, 2Dept. of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon
University — The Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry (WPPR) is a joint
effort involving the Departments of Psychology and the Center for the
Neural Basis of Cognition at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie
Mellon University. The intent is to foster clinical research, specifically
human neuropsychological investigations, as a convergent method
within cognitive neuroscience. WPPR is a HIPAA-compliant clinical registry of over 800 individuals with focal brain injury who are interested in
participating in research studies. The WPPR database contains, with participants’ consent, de-identified profiles offering complete pictures of
their brain injury status, including medical reports, demographic information, clinical diagnoses, basic neuropsychological assessments, radiological reports of lesions/location, as well as actual images. The deidentified profile information is stored in a MySQL database and is
accessible to registered users through a web-based graphical interface.
WPPR was designed to serve the needs of local researchers but it has
potential value at the national level. The database tools and data management strategies that have been developed are available for other
researchers engaged in neuropsychological research. For instance, specialized software has been developed to automatically upload, reformat,
and display representative slices from medical images acquired using a
variety of formats and naming conventions. The accumulated data has
value for investigators interested in the effects of focal brain injury, or
computational approaches for automated brain registration and lesion

WHITE MATTER DIFFUSIVITY: CHANGES BETWEEN SELECT DEMENTIA
GROUPS Jeremy F. Strain1, John Hart1, Ramon Diaz-Arrastia2, Kyle B.

Womack2; 1The University of Texas at Dallas, 2University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center — Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia

(FTD) are neurodegenerative disorders that differ in their histopathology. Protein inclusions in the oligodendrocytes of white matter are
present in many forms of FTD, but not in AD. Diffusion Tensor Imaging
(DTI) is an MRI technique that measures the directional diffusivity of
water and is sensitive to changes in white matter integrity. Analyses may
utilize diffusivity measures, directly or use derived values such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Subjects: 28 patients with AD, 19 patients with
FTD, and 28 normal controls (NC) Methods: Images were collected from
a 3T scanner and processed using the brain-imaging program FSL. Global voxel-wise analyses of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity
(AxD), radial diffusivity (RD) and FA were conducted in FSL with the
tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) and Randomize modules (?=0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Results: While robust differences in FA
were seen comparing dementia groups and controls, differences in FA
were not seen between FTD and AD. Significant voxels were found for
AxD but MD and RD differences were trending towards significance
(p=0.06 and p=0.08 respectively). Conclusions: As predicted from histopathology, white matter integrity was more disrupted in FTD than in
AD. Diffusivity measures were more sensitive than FA for demonstrating this difference. Our data shows that the increased diffusivity seen in
FTD, as compared to AD, is relatively proportional in the axial and
radial directions creating a situation in which the FA remains relatively
stable in the face of increasing diffusivity.

A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF THE EFFECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND
ANTIPSYCHOTICS ON COGNITION Ahmed Moustafa1, Szabolcs Keri2,

University-Newark,

2University

of Szeged, Hungary —

Prior computational models of schizophrenia simulate either prefrontal
or hippocampal dysfunction in these patients, and most of these models
did not simulate the effects of antipsychotics on cognition. However,
empirical results have shown that schizophrenia is associated with disruption to the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and the hippocampus, as
well as to dopaminergic projections to these brain regions. Empirical
studies have also shown that antipsychotics enhance performance in
latent inhibition and acquired equivalence, but have no effect on working memory tasks. We present here a neural network model of prefrontal-striatal-hippocampal interactions which simulates cognitive
dysfunction in schizophrenia. According to our model, positive symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with hippocampal dysfunction,
while the occurrence of negative symptoms is associated with frontostriatal deficits in a subset of patients. Accordingly, our simulation results
show that the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia correlates
with impaired feedback learning, as found empirically. In our model,
latent inhibition and acquired equivalence deficits in schizophrenia are
associated with hippocampal dysfunction, while working memory deficits are associated with prefrontal dysfunction. In agreement with empirical results, our simulation results show that antipsychotics enhance
performance in latent inhibition and acquired equivalence, but not in
working memory tasks. In sum, our new computational model (a) provides a systems-level analysis of cognitive dysfunction in different subtypes of schizophrenia patients, and (b) simulates the enhancing and
deleterious effects of antipsychotics on cognition.

IMPROVING BEHAVIOR, COGNITION AND NEURAL MECHANISMS OF
ATTENTION IN AT-RISK CHILDREN Helen J. Neville1, Courtney Stevens1,2,

Scott Klein1, Jessica Fanning1, Ted Bell1, Elif Cakir1, Eric Pakulak1; 1University
of Oregon, 2Willamette University — The impact of lower socioeconomic status (SES) on the cognitive skills and brain function of children and adults
has been well documented (Hackman et al., 2010). Additionally, the considerable personal costs to individuals and the economic costs to society
of such achievement gaps have been well documented. Recent metaanalyses of costly studies initiated in the 1960s have shown that programs that target low-SES preschoolers and their parents can ameliorate
such problems (Heckman, 2010). Different systems of the brain display
different degrees and timeperiods of neuroplasticity. Relevant here are
studies showing that selective attention is a highly malleable system that
is both enhanced in remaining modalities following sensory deprivation,
shows deficits in developmental disorders and in typically developing
low SES children and that selective attention can be increased in both
typically and non-typically developing children following computerized
training (Stevens and Neville, 2010). Here we targeted highly plastic
attention systems in a randomized, pre/post training study with 104
Head Start (HS) preschoolers (at risk for school failure because of their
low SES) and their parents. It included a parenting program and attention training for children that we show boosts mechanisms of attention.
After eight weeks of such training, parenting practices improved, stress
decreased, and children’s behavior, social skills, cognition and neural
mechanisms of attention improved significantly when compared to children and parents randomly assigned to HS without training. These
results carry implications for ongoing discussions concerning evidencebased early education programs that could impact at-risk children and
reduce achievement gaps.

OBJECT INDIVIDUATION IN CHICKS: USE OF PROPERTY/KIND

Department of General Psychology, University of Padua — Object individua-

2

tion is the process by which organisms establish the number of distinct
objects present in an event. Previous research demonstrated that chicks
are able to use spatiotemporal and property information for object individuation. The ability to use property/kind information is assessed
employing imprinting objects and food items (i.e. mealworms). Newborn chicks were reared with 5 identical imprinting objects. On day 2
each chick underwent a free choice test in which 2 groups of events were
shown: a group comprised two stimuli i.e. an imprinting object and a
food item; the second group was composed by a single stimulus (i.e.
either imprinting object or food item) presented twice (Exp.1). Each stimulus in each group of events was sequentially presented and concealed
in the same spatial location; each group of events took place in a different spatial location and the number of events was equalized. Chicks
(N=24) spontaneously approached the two different stimuli rather than
the single stimulus seen twice. A possible preference for the more varied
set of stimuli was excluded by testing chicks (N=12) in a simultaneous
presentation of two imprinting objects Vs. two food items (Exp.2).

THE POWER OF SUGGESTION EXTENDS BEYOND ILLNESS. EXPECTATIONINDUCED MODULATION OF TOUCH Mirta Fiorio1, Serena Recchia1,

Federica Corrà1, Michele Tinazzi1; 1University of Verona, Italy — Evolutionary
theories explain the analgesic placebo effect as a process of interpersonal
healing, having a survival value for individuals. Being the placebo effect
deeply rooted in humans, it is conceivable that it exerts its power even in
unnecessary circumstances, beyond illness and pain. In the current study
we aimed at inducing enhancement of tactile perception, by influencing
expectation. A group of subjects, attending to a stimulated body side,
has been verbally suggested and surreptitiously conditioned about the
effect of an inert cream in enhancing tactile perception, while a control
109

Poster Session D — Sunday, April 3, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
group was informed about the real inefficacy of the cream. The placebo
group referred higher tactile sensation after treatment than before,
although the intensity of stimulation was identical in the two conditions.
In order to unveil whether the neurophysiological underpinnings of this
effect should be ascribed to early or late stimulus processing, we measured the amplitude of early-middle and late somatosensory evoked
potentials (SEP), before and after treatment. Results showed that the placebo manipulation has no effect on low level tactile processing, as the
amplitude of the early and middle SEPs. Conversely, we found modifications in the late SEPs, suggesting that the placebo effect might be
related to late cognitive processing of tactile information, probably due
to expectation and attention. Our study is the first demonstration that
manipulating subjects’ expectation has reflections in the processing of
tactile information, without obvious protective or survival value for the
individual, thus extending the power of human suggestion beyond illness.

Development, Indonesia, 2University of California at Davis, 3Georgetown
University, 4Lancaster University, UK, 5Mataram University, Indonesia, 6Harvard
University — Brain development and function throughout the lifespan

depend on adequate nutrition, including micronutrients (vitamins and
minerals). For example, during fetal and infant development micronutrients play a role in neuron proliferation and myelination, while in adulthood, micronutrients are essential for neurotransmitter synthesis. Acute
micronutrient deficiencies can lead to severe effects on the central nervous system in utero (e.g., maternal folic acid deficiency can cause spina
bifida) and throughout adulthood (e.g., thiamine deficiency can cause
memory loss). The extent to which non-clinical micronutrient deficiencies during pregnancy impair maternal and child cognition is not yet
clear. We assessed participants in a randomized trial in Indonesia, comparing maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation to iron
and folic acid supplementation provided during pregnancy until three
months postpartum. We evaluated 640 mothers on eight tests of mood
and cognition (e.g., working memory, declarative memory, reading,
motor function) after an average of 25 weeks of supplementation. We followed up by assessing 487 of their children at age 3.5 years on eight tests
of socio-emotional and cognitive development (e.g., picture vocabulary,
visual attention/spatial ability, motor function). For undernourished
mothers (mid-upper arm circumference < 23.5 cm), MMN improved cognition both in the mothers at the time of supplementation (especially
reading), and in the children 3.5 years later (especially motor function
and visual attention/spatial ability). These findings suggest that undernourishment during pregnancy is associated with cognitive impairments
both in pregnant mothers and in their children several years later, and
that both impairments can be corrected with maternal MMN supplementation during pregnancy.

DYNAMIC FACIAL EXPRESSIONS EVOKE DISTINCT ACTIVATION IN THE
FACE PERCEPTION NETWORK AS REVEALED BY PARALLEL FMRI AND
MEG ANALYSIS Elaine Foley1, Gina Rippon1, Carl Senior1; 1Aston
University, Birmingham, UK — The neural structures involved in the perception of dynamic facial expressions of emotion were investigated
using both functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). A unique set of naturalistic dynamic facial
expressions was specifically created and in both procedures participants
viewed video clips and static images of angry, happy and speech face
stimuli. Through fMRI (n=14) a dynamic face perception network was
identified, including early visual regions, such as the Inferior Occipital

110

Gyrus (IOG), insensitive to motion or affect but sensitive to the visual
stimulus; the superior temporal sulcus (STS), specifically sensitive to
motion, and the amygdala, recruited to process affect, particularly
dynamic angry facial expressions. MEG (n=12) and Synthetic Aperture
Magnetometry (SAM) were then used to examine the spatiotemporal
profile of neurophysiological activity within this dynamic face perception network. This analysis revealed an early decrease in the beta frequency (15-35 Hz) band in the right IOG at 200ms post stimulus onset for
dynamic relative to static expressions, and a slightly later decrease in the
left IOG at 400ms post stimulus onset, across the group of participants.
Bilateral STS also showed a decrease in power in the beta frequency (1535 Hz) band at 750ms in response to dynamic faces, across the group.
These findings support the presence of a dedicated network of cortical
regions that mediate the perception of dynamic facial expressions, with
the fMRI data providing information on the spatial co-ordinates paralleled by the MEG data which indicate the temporal dynamics within this
network.

INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN AMYGDALA INVOLVEMENT IN THEORY OF
MIND: AN FMRI STUDY Karen Lythe1, Andrew Lawrence1; 1Cardiff
University, UK — A key component of social cognition is “theory of mind”
(ToM) or the ability to infer others’ mental states. A network of core
regions, including temporoparietal junction (TPJ), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and precuneus is thought to underpin ToM abilities.
Lesion, functional imaging and electrophysiological studies in humans
and nonhuman animals have demonstrated a role for the amygdala in
processing stimuli with emotional and social significance. However,
there is some debate as to the extent to which the amygdala forms part of
the core ToM network. One reason for this is that there may be considerable individual variation in amygdala reactivity during ToM processing.
To examine this, we examined the influence of individual differences in
performance on advanced ToM tests (Reading the Mind in the Eyes, faux
pas recognition) and dispositional empathy (Toronto Empathy Questionnaire) on BOLD signal response in the amygdala when people reasoned about the contents of another person’s mind, relative to a control
physical condition. fMRI data were collected from 40 female participants
using a 3T GE scanner. Across participants, activity was seen in core
ToM regions (including TPJ, precuneus, dmPFC). Importantly, individual differences in Mind in the Eyes test accuracy, but not self-reported
empathy, significantly predicted left and right amygdala response during the ToM task. These results suggest that variation in amygdala
response during ToM tasks is importantly related to social cognitive abilities, and have important implications for understanding the role of the
amygdala in social cognition and its disorders.

A CORTICAL NETWORK FOR PLEASANT AND UNPLEASANT FACIAL
EXPRESSIONS PROCESSING: VALIDATION ANALYSES OF THE
LATERALITY HYPOTHESES BY DYNAMIC CAUSAL MODELLING Hiroaki

Itoh1, Midori Shibata1, Hiroki Motoyama1, Jun-ichi Abe1; 1Hokkaido
University — There are two competing hypotheses for the lateralized pro-

cessing of facial expressions. On the one hand, the right-hemisphere
dominance hypothesis (RHH) suggests that the right hemisphere is
dominant for processing all facial expressions regardless of their affective valence. On the other hand, the valence-specific hypothesis (VSH)
suggests that the left hemisphere is specialized for processing pleasant
facial expressions, while the right hemisphere is specialized for processing unpleasant facial expressions. In this study, we examined the validity of the two hypotheses using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and
Bayesian Model Selection (BMS). Eleven participants performed a
blocked fMRI paradigm, viewing pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral facial
expressions. We constructed two DCM models: The RHH model
assumes that pleasant and unpleasant facial expressions modulate forward connections from the bilateral fusiform gyrus (FG) to the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), whereas the VSH model assumes that pleasant
facial expressions modulate forward connections from the bilateral FG to

the left OFC, while unpleasant facial expressions modulate forward connections from the bilateral FG to the right OFC. BMS revealed that the
RHH model fitted marginally better than the VSH model. Regarding the
activating patterns, pleasant facial expressions enhanced forward connections from the bilateral FG to the right OFC, while unpleasant facial
expressions did not enhance any connections. Taken together, the
present results supported neither hypothesis, suggesting that processing
of pleasant facial expressions enhanced activation of the right frontal
cortex, while processing of unpleasant facial expressions did not
enhance activation of either cortex.

(S1) has been linked to both felt touch and observed touch. This has led
to the assumption that S1 forms a key part of a system for mirroring
observed touch. Moreover, recent findings have suggested social sensitivity in S1 in the sense that its anterior parts are preferably recruited
during observation of self-related touch, and its posterior parts showing
stronger responsitivity during observation of other-related touch. Here,
we aimed to explore this hypothesis further by conducting a functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study at high-field (7 Tesla). We presented short video sequences of hands being either touched or nontouched to healthy participants. Importantly, self-attribution of observed
touch and non-touch was modulated by varying hand perspective (egocentric versus allocentric) and hand identity (self versus other) in a
2x2x2-factorial design. Our results clearly relate activity increase of S1 to
observed touch versus non-touch conditions. S1 activity, however, did
not show any systematic modulatory shifts during observed touch with
respect to differences in hand perspective, or hand identity. Instead, on a
group level, similar areas within S1 were recruited irrespectively of
whose hand was being touched, or in which perspective the hand was
shown. Our findings therefore contradict previous results and do not
support the assumption that directed activity shifts within subregions of
S1 may reflect the degree of self-attribution during observed touch.

Long2, Robert Thoma2; 1The Mind Research Network, 2The University of New
Mexico — Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and per-

sistent condition with a significant affective component that can disrupt
the social relationships of those afflicted. Facial affect recognition is an
important component of social cognition, and this pilot study aimed to
evaluate the impact of PTSD on the early stages of visual processing of
facial emotion in the calcarine fissure and fusiform gyrus in combat veterans. We hypothesized that magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activation would reveal group differences in the processing of facial emotion
as seen in the amplitude and latency of the M100 visual peak in the calcarine fissure and the M160 face-specific peak in the fusiform gyrus.
MEG data were collected while five combat veterans with PTSD and five
combat-exposed controls without PTSD were presented repeatedly with
faces of happy, fearful, and neutral affect, as well as a swirled face control condition. Across groups the effect of facial versus swirled stimulus
was significant on both amplitude and latency in the bilateral fusiform
gyrus, with swirls eliciting lesser amplitude and longer latency than
faces. Group differences were found such that PTSD subjects showed
lesser activation and longer latencies versus controls. A group effect on
the response differential between happy and fearful faces was found on
right hemisphere amplitude and left fusiform latency. An effect of age on
fusiform amplitude was also found. The data suggest that the processing
of facial affect is altered in people who suffer from PTSD.

study examined the role of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plasticity in the inhibition of implicit and
explicit bias. Specifically, normal controls and patients with varied OFC
and DLPFC lesion size and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, a gene known to
either promote (Met/Val SNP) or stifle (Val/Val SNP) neural plasticity
in damaged prefrontal cortex regions, completed measures of implicit
and explicit gender bias. Patients demonstrated comparable levels of
implicit bias compared to controls, but patients’ implicit bias was moderated by lesion size and BDNF SNP. Patients with Met/Val SNPs exhibited greater stereotype inhibition to the extent they had smaller OFC
lesions compared to their Val/Val counterparts and patients with large
OFC lesions. Both patients and controls demonstrated patterns of
explicit bias consistent with hypotheses. Furthermore, patients with
Met/Val SNPs exhibited less explicit bias to the extent they had smaller
DLPFC lesions sizes compared to their Val/Val counterparts and those
with large DLPFC lesions. Findings highlight the integral role of OFC
and DLPFC in the expression of implicit and explicit bias respectively
and suggest that neural plasticity within these regions moderates their
efficaciousness in executing inhibitory and control processes.

Bridge1, Ken A. Paller1; 1Northwestern University — Memory encoding often
necessitates a bias whereby some details of an experience are prioritized
in memory while others are discarded. What factors determine what will
be remembered later? Learning context can play an important role, as
demonstrated in our prior study of memory for faces with neutral
expressions (Bridge et al., 2010). In that study, memory was systematically modulated according to whether faces were learned in a happy or
sad encoding context (HEC or SEC). Memory for HEC faces was superior
when tested in an upright orientation; memory for SEC faces was superior when tested in an inverted orientation. We inferred that the HEC
promoted holistic encoding, whereas the SEC promoted feature-oriented
encoding. In the present study, we analyzed event-related potentials to
determine whether right-occipito-temporal N170 potentials might reveal
evidence for a global or local emphasis due to encoding context. Generally, face-sensitive N170 potentials do not vary as a function of memory.
Nevertheless, we found that N170 amplitudes to remembered faces (hits
during recognition testing) were greater for HEC faces than for SEC
faces. Additionally, N170 potentials during recognition testing were significantly right-lateralized for HEC faces but not for SEC faces or new
faces. Configural information may have been under-weighted or featural
information preferentially accessed when SEC faces were successfully
recognized. In sum, encoding context can have an influence extending
well beyond encoding, in that happiness versus sadness engenders a
memory bias for configural versus featural facial information, respectively, with repercussions evident in subsequent memory.

Center for Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Department of Psychology,

China Normal University — Introduction: The neural underpinnings of
social reward (e.g. attractive face) anticipation, evaluation and their relationship investigated in the current fMRI study are crucial in understanding human decision-making in social realm and are largely
unknown to date. Method: Participants were presented in each trial with
a Gaussian-blurred picture of female face and were asked to make an
attractive/unattractive force-choice. Then a picture of clear face was presented as feedback (Fig. 1). Result: 1) upon guessing: compared with the
“unattractive” judgment, the “attractive” judgment activated right
amygdala and left insula activation (Fig. 2a); 2) upon feedback: attractive
faces activated ventral striatum and bilateral fusiform comparing with
unattractive faces (Fig. 2b); predicted outcomes elicited greater activation in ventromedial orbital frontal cortex (vmOFC) than unpredicted
ones (Fig. 3); 3) correlation between guess and feedback phases: right
amygdala activity following the “attractive” judgment correlated with
the activation difference, in both vmOFC and ventral striatum, between
attractive and unattractive faces in the feedback phase (Figs. 2c and 2d).
Conclusion: 1) differential neural activity in the limbic structure in the
guess phase reflects anticipation towards the affective nature of the outcome; and 2) affective anticipation modulates the process of outcome
evaluation in OFC and ventral striatum.

PRIMING AFFECTIVE INCONGRUITY IN BICULTURAL INDIVIDUALS USING
THE N400 Michelle Fong1, Colleen Moore2, Tracy Zhao2, Zach Schudson2,

Sharon Goto2, Richard Lewis2; 1Harvey Mudd College, 2Pomona College — The
effect of priming cultural schemas on the neural mechanisms underlying
attention is not yet well understood. Individuals in multicultural environments often switch between cultural schemas according to the immediate sociocultural context (Hong et al., 2000). Across several behavioral,
electrophysiological and neural measures, individuals from collectivist
cultures (e.g., East Asians) have been shown to allocate greater attention
to background objects and context relative to individuals from individualistic cultures (e.g., European Americans) (Masuda et al., 2008). We
sought to examine whether or not priming of independent and interdependent self-construal affects neural activity underlying attention to
social contexts in bicultural individuals (i.e., East Asian Americans).
Using a modified N400 event-related potential design (Goto et al., 2010),
we measured the degree to which 37 monoracial East Asian American
participants, undergraduates aged 18-22 years, responded to semantic
incongruity in the emotional expression of a central figure relative to the
surrounding figures. The priming procedure consisted of two tasks, the
Sumerian Warrior Story task and the Similarities and Differences with
Friends and Family task, both of which have been shown to reliably
impact self-construal (Trafimow et al., 1991). All subjects were given
both independent and interdependent primes, with the order of the
primes alternating between subjects. As predicted, when participants
were primed with interdependent values they displayed greater N400s
when viewing incongruent affective stimuli than when primed with
independent values. This finding suggests that frame switching in bicultural individuals affects the affective processing of social relationships.

THE NEURAL BASES OF UPDATING IMPRESSIONS Peter

MendeSiedlecki1, Yang Cai1, Alexander Todorov1; 1Princeton University — Person

perception is a dynamic, evolving process. Since other people are an
endless source of social information, quite often we find ourselves in situations where new information we learn about an individual is not consistent with previously learned information. Thus, the capacity to update
our impressions of those around us is critical. We devised an fMRI study

112

designed to identify brain regions involved in the process of updating
impressions. Subjects saw neutral male faces with either positive or negative behavioral information printed below them, and were asked to
form impressions of these individuals. Each face was seen five times in a
row, each time with a different piece of behavioral information. For half
of the faces, the valence of the information was kept consistent—on all
five trials, the face was paired with either positive or negative information. Critically, for the rest of the faces, the valence of the information
changed on the fourth trial—making the fourth and fifth trials inconsistent with information previously learned about that person. We ran a
contrast of all face+behavior trials against control trials (faces alone) to
identify regions involved for impression formation. Consistent with
prior work, this contrast yielded activity in dmPFC, PCC, and amygdala.
Activity in the dmPFC ROI increased significantly from trial 3 to trial 4
in the inconsistent condition, but remained stable from trial 3 to trial four
in the consistent condition. This condition-specific increase in dmPFC
activity paralleled changes subjects’ ratings of trustworthiness from trial
3 to trial 4.

COMPARISON OF BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION AND CHANNEL-BASED
EEG ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES Adrienne Moore1, Irina Gorodnitsky1, Jaime

Pineda1; 1University of California, San Diego — The goal of this study was to
determine whether the electroencephalographic (EEG) mu rhythm is
modulated by observation of emotional faces, and whether the mu
response to emotional faces can be studied with a blind source separation (BSS) based approach applied to data collected with an array of 17
scalp electrodes. The mu rhythm is typically considered an 8-13 Hz sensorimotor cortex rhythm and is believed to reflect the activity of a “mirroring system” for comprehending the actions of others by simulating
them. Observation of emotional facial expressions activates the mirror
neuron system, pointing to the hypothesis that the mu rhythm also
responds to emotional face observation. However because EEG signals
recorded from scalp electrodes are often a mixture of several source signals with imprecisely known locations in the brain, the optimal means of
addressing the mu face observation hypothesis is not obvious. The
results of this study show that the mu response to emotional faces, if
measured as the signals from individual EEG electrodes, is a mixture of
source signals from various parts of the brain. The Second-Order Blind
Identification (SOBI) algorithm successfully unmixes these signals into
dipolar source components with only a 17 electrode array. There are
important differences between the emotional face mu response derived
from SOBI components and the traditionally derived mu face response.
SOBI based analysis confirms that the mu rhythm is modulated by
observation of emotional faces, consistent with the view that face perception involves mirroring, or motor cortical simulation of an observed
expression.

RACE MODULATES THE NEURAL UNDERPINNINGS OF IMITATION: SELFSIMILARITY VS FAMILIARITY Elizabeth Reynolds Losin1, Marco Iacoboni1,

Mirella Dapretto1; 1University of California, Los Angeles — We aimed to disentangle the effects of model-observer similarity and familiarity on the
neural mechanics of imitation. Both factors can bias individuals to learn
from certain models, thereby increasing the adaptive value (e.g., self-relevance) of learned information. In prior studies of action observation,
however, model similarity and familiarity have often been confounded.
Here we compared the neural encoding of race during imitation between
participants from a racial majority, European American (EA), and a
racial minority, African American (AA). In a novel fMRI paradigm, participants imitated videos of EA and AA models performing unfamiliar
meaningless hand actions. All participants reported feeling most similar
to ingroup models. However, EA participants reported less experience
with AAs than their racial ingroup whereas AA participants reported
comparable levels of racial experience with ingroup and EA individuals.
At the neural level, EA and AA participants exhibited opposite patterns

of activity. AA participants exhibited more activity in visual and motor
regions when imitating ingroup compared to outgroup individuals. EA
participants exhibited more activity in a similar suite of visual and motor
regions when imitating outgroup compared to ingroup members. In
other words, both EA and AA participants exhibited greater activity in
imitation-related regions while imitating AA than EA models. Furthermore, almost no differences resulted from a between-group comparison
on the [imitate AA > EA] contrast. These findings suggest that racial similarity alone cannot explain the neural encoding of race during imitation
and that racial experience may also play a significant role.

THE ROLE OF MIRRORING IN DECEPTION: A MU SUPPRESSION STUDY

Arnold Noriega1,3, Daniel Chun2,3, Jamie A. Pineda2,3; 1Department of
Psychology, 2Department of Cognitive Science, 3University of California, San
Diego — Deception is based in part on having a theory of mind (TOM),
that is, being able to infer what beliefs, thoughts, and knowledge others
might have (Spence 2004). One proposed neural mechanism for gaining
such insight is the human mirror neuron system (MNS), which is
assumed to involve a significant amount of similar neural activity as a
“common coding between perceived and generated action” in an
observer and an observed individual (Pineda 2009). Thus, it stands to
reason that the process of deception might be associated with changes in
activity in the human MNS (Gallese et al., 1998). The present study was
designed to test if MNS activity depends on whether an individual is
engaged in truth-telling or deception. Suppression of EEG mu rhythms
(8-13Hz oscillations with sources in sensorimotor cortex) was used as an
index of mirroring activity. A within-subjects design was utilized in
which subjects were asked to either tell the truth or lie for each block of
15 autobiographical questions. EEG data collected from fifteen subjects
(10 females) were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance. Significance was found in the Frontal, Central and Midline sites.
Constant with previous research, such as Zuckerman et al. 1981, telling a
lie is more demanding than truth telling reflected by the most engagement of the mirror neuron system. Cognitive complexity only partially
explains deception due lack of differences in mu suppression between
truth and deception conditions. Regional variation in mu suppression
suggests a variety of mechanisms involved.

Oxford — Prior research suggests that there are subtle differences between

males and females in mentalizing. Females also tend to self-report more
trait empathy than males. However, although the neural circuits generally involved in mentalizing are well characterized, little is known about
how individual differences in trait empathy as well as one's sex influences the recruitment of such circuits. Here we show on a relatively large
sample of healthy males and females (n = 66), that some of the neural
systems integral for mentalizing respond in a sexually dimorphic fashion and are related to individual differences in trait empathy. Participants were scanned with fMRI at 3T while making reflective mentalizing
or physical judgments about either themselves or familiar but non-close
other (e.g., the British Queen). Despite near identical behavioral
responses between males and females during scanning, females scored
higher on trait empathy than males. Whole-brain FDR-corrected analyses highlighted more pronounced Mentalizing>Physical response in
males compared to females in right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). RTPJ response was also negatively correlated with trait empathy. In a subset of males and females matched for

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

level of trait empathy (n=50), the negative correlation and sex difference
in neural response were still apparent. These results demonstrate that
neural mentalizing response is influenced by both trait empathy and sex.
The characterization of normative patterns reported here has important
implications for neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, where
skewed sex ratios and deficits in mentalizing and empathy are paramount.

BRAD CLOONEY AND ANGELINA HILTON? EXTRACTING MEAN IDENTITY
FROM FAMOUS FACE SETS Markus F. Neumann1, Stefan R.

Schweinberger1,2; 1Friedrich Schiller University Jena, 2DFG Research Unit
Person Perception — When confronted with arrays of simultaneously pre-

sented objects, statistical mean representations may serve as an efficient
way of coding information. Accordingly, participants precisely extracted
mean size information from sets of circles varying in size, while information about individual exemplars was nearly absent (Ariely, 2001, Psychological Science). Similarly, mean emotion and mean gender (Haberman
& Whitney, 2007, Current Biology), and mean identity (de Fockert &
Wolfenstein, 2009, Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology) can be
extracted from sets of unfamiliar faces. In the present study, participants
saw sets of four faces from different, well-known celebrities. They indicated whether or not a subsequent probe face was an image (Exp.1a) or
identity (Exp.1b) previously seen in the set. Probes were either exemplars (real face photographs) or averages across images of four different
identities. Furthermore, probes either corresponded to the set (i.e.,
included set images), or were new images from the same set identities, or
were images from different famous identities. We hypothesized that
famous identities should activate distinct representations (face recognition units) and expected mean identity representations not to be formed.
Unexpectedly, participants produced large proportions of “present”
responses to both the corresponding exemplar and, to a lesser extent, the
corresponding average conditions. During identity matching a similar
pattern additionally emerged for averages across four new images from
set identities, suggesting high-level identity averaging. Control experiments ruled out alternative explanation such as participant’s response
biases. We concluded that in addition to strong exemplar face representations mean identity representations were extracted from famous face
sets.

Schweinberger1,2, Holger Wiese1,2; 1Department of General Psychology and
Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Jena, Germany, 2DFG Person Perception
Research Unit, University of Jena, Germany — Whereas familiar face process-

ing is usually characterized by individual identification, efficient perception of unfamiliar faces typically involves their categorization (e.g., into
male vs. female faces). Aiming at a deeper understanding of these processes, the present ERP study examined the effect of facial age on gender
categorization. We presented participants with male and female adult
faces of three age groups and asked them to categorize each face according to its gender. Examining the potential contributions of featural and
configural information, we presented each face in both an unfiltered and
low-pass filtered (blurred) version as well as in upright and inverted orientation. Behavioral results revealed a pronounced effect of facial age on
gender classification: Participants were faster to categorize female than
male faces when these were young, but were faster to categorize male
than female faces when these were middle-aged or old. The additional
finding that blurring speeded up gender categorization for old female
faces while slowing down the categorization of old male faces suggests
that the influence of facial age on gender categorization might be moderated by the smoothness of the skin texture. Analysis of electrophysiological data revealed a strong effect of age on the N170 for which increasing
facial age evoked increasing amplitudes. Interestingly, this effect was
restricted to the unfiltered versions of the stimuli, suggesting its related-

ness to high spatial frequency information in faces. Finally, N170 inversion effects were larger for young than middle-aged and old faces,
possibly reflecting enhanced configural processing of young faces in
young participants.

BRAIN REGIONS INVOLVED IN PROCESSING OTHERS’ PAIN ARE
MODULATED BY SOCIAL GROUP MEMBERSHIP Glenn R. Fox1,2,3, Mona

Sobhani1,2,3, Lisa Aziz-Zadeh1,2,3; 1Brain and Creativity Institute,
2Neuroscience Graduate Program, 3University of Southern California — Investigations focusing on the neural substrates of empathy have primarily
focused on physical or tangible cues to invoke an empathic response. For
instance, neuroimaging studies on empathy for physical pain have identified a set of regions, including the cingulate and insula, known as the
“pain matrix” (Jackson et. al., 2006). Activity in the matrix can be modulated by factors such as perceived fairness, (Singer, 2006), facial expression, (Xu & Han, 2009) and race, (Xu & Han, 2008). Less is known of how
these empathic responses can be modulated by non-physical cues to
group membership, such as religion. In this study, 19 neurologically
normal Jewish subjects were familiarized, outside the scanner, with stories of eight individuals (targets). Half of the targets belonged to neoNazi groups, whereas the other half did not. Next, while undergoing
fMRI, subjects viewed video clips of the targets receiving a painful stimulation (injection in the hand) or a non-painful stimulation as control (Qtip touch). Our results showed a strong modulation in the pain matrix,
as well as in reward regions and regions associated with top-down cognitive function while perceiving dislikable people in pain. To investigate
how regions modulated by group membership may be “functionally”
connected to other regions, we performed an analysis using psychophysiological interaction (PPI). This analysis showed connections between
limbic cortices and those associated with top-down cognition. Our
results support the notion that social group membership and likability
modulate activity in regions involved in processing others in pain.

THE P2 ERP COMPONENT DISTINGUISHES AMONG ATTRACTIVE,
AVERAGED, AND UNATTRACTIVE FACES Logan Trujillo1, Jessica M.

Jankowitsch1, Connor Principe1, Judith H. Langlois1; 1University of Texas at
Austin — Many studies have shown that adults, children, and infants

judge people differently based on facial attractiveness and that faces are
perceived as attractive when their facial configuration approximates the
average facial configuration of the population. Conversely, faces that
deviate from this average configuration are perceived as unattractive.
There is minimal neurocognitive evidence, however, showing that
attractive and average faces are processed similarly and in a manner distinct from the processing of unattractive faces. To address this issue, we
recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction time from 27 adult
human participants while they discriminated between human and monkey faces. Participants viewed three kinds of human faces: high attractive (faces independently rated at the high end of a 7-point attractiveness
scale), low attractive (faces independently rated at the low end of a 7point attractiveness scale), and morphed faces (32-face mathematical
composites of high and low attractive faces that are typically judged to
be highly attractive). Participants were significantly faster to categorize
morphed vs. low attractive faces, and marginally faster to categorize
high vs. low attractive faces, as human. The posterior P2 ERP component
(200 – 300 ms post-stimulus onset) was significantly larger in response to
high attractive and morphed faces vs. low attractive faces. As the P2 is
thought to reflect a generalized cognitive matching process, these P2 differences may indicate a correspondence between stored facial representations and the attractive/morphed faces. Overall, the present findings
provide further evidence that faces are perceived as attractive when they
approximate an average facial configuration.

COMPETITION EFFECTS OF SOCIAL THREAT CUES IN A CHANGE
J.
DETECTION TASK- EVIDENCE FROM STEADY-STATE VEPS Matthias
Wieser1,2, Lisa M. McTeague2, Andreas Keil2; 1University of Würzburg, 2Center
for the Study of Emotion and Attention, University of Florida — Numerous

studies have shown that emotional stimuli attract attention and enhance
perception. This is especially true if the stimuli hold a special relevance
for the observer like phobic stimuli. In addition to conventional ERP
research, steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), which are
defined by a resonant oscillatory response of visual cortex to repetitive
stimulation, offer an avenue to observing electro-cortical facilitation as
an index of enhanced attentional engagement. Using frequency tagging
(i.e. simultaneously flickering multiple stimuli at multiple frequencies),
it is possible to separate visual cortical activity to spatially overlapping
stimuli. Thus, attentional selection and competition can be tested in conditions in which multiple stimuli compete for attention resources. In the
present study, a change detection task array was spatially overlaid over
a facial expression (angry, happy, neutral), each flickering at a different
frequency (15 vs. 20 Hz), while high-density EEG was recorded from 256
sensors in 17 low and 17 high socially anxious participants. Socially anxious participants showed only slightly enhanced ssVEP amplitudes to
angry faces. However, the signal amplitude of the concurrent task array
was reduced when competing with angry faces, which demonstrates
cost effects, potentially caused by attention capture by angry faces. No
impairments were observed regarding change detection accuracy. It is
suggested that phobia-relevant stimuli draw attentional resources when
competing for attention resources and that such competition is most easily observed when stimulating the same population of neurons by using
spatially overlapping stimuli.

MODULATION OF THE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM BY SOCIAL GROUP
MEMBERSHIP Mona Sobhani1,2, Glenn Fox1,2, Lisa Aziz-Zadeh1,3; 1Brain

and Creativity Institute, 2The Neuroscience Graduate Program, 3Division of
Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy — Social group membership is an intrinsic and powerful component of human social behavior.
Social group membership can be manipulated quickly, at a level outside
direct cognitive control (e.g. Tajfel, 1971; Aronson and Linder, 1965).
Here we examined how social group membership may modulate the
mirror neuron system. Eighteen Jewish subjects were familiarized with
stories of eight individuals, half of which belonged to Neo-Nazi groups
and half of which did not. While undergoing fMRI, the subjects then
viewed clips of actors depicting individuals in the stories performing
simple motor actions (e.g. grasping a water bottle and raising it to their
lips) or a still image of the actor and water bottle as a control. We predicted that the mirror system would be more active for individuals more
similar to the self; thus viewing individuals from the out-group perform
actions would generate less activity in the mirror neuron system. However, we found a trend directly opposite to our predictions; the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was more active for members of the out-group as
compared to the in-group. These data provide a novel understanding of
how we process individuals that we dislike and dissociate from the self.

response following emotional stimuli is not automatic as previously
thought. For example, studies that assessed emotional influence on
attentional tasks found that emotional interference was reduced under

high attentional load or under conflict situations. The current research
was designed to examine if a conflicting task could attenuate papillary
response for emotional pictures. Participants first responded to a flanker
task and then saw a picture that could be emotionally negative or neutral. Pupil diameter was measured during the experiment. We found
that emotional interference, as assessed by larger pupil dilatation for the
emotional pictures, was modulated by the flanker task. More specifically, the difference in pupil dilatation for emotional pictures and neutral
pictures was smaller after incongruent flanker trials compared with after
congruent flanker trials. We suggest that after conflict resolution processes are activated, our emotional system is down-regulated. From an
evolutionary perspective, the ability to inhibit emotion under conflicting
situations is crucial for our survival.

REGULATING NEGATIVE EMOTIONS IN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS: NEURAL
AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO REAPPRAISAL AND
VERBALIZING ONE'S FEELINGS AFTER BEING TREATED UNFAIR
Mascha van 't Wout1, Steven Rasmussen1; 1Brown University — Although

emotion regulation is considered to be essential in every day life and in
social interactions in particular, no studies directly examine the neural
and psychophyiological effects of different emotion regulatory techniques in a social context. The Ultimatum Game provides a way to elicit
negative feelings, i.e. unfairness in a social setting. We examined neural
and skin conductance responses to two regulatory mechanisms: reappraisal and verbalizing one's own emotions after people were treated
unfairly while being scanned with fMRI. Data of seven participants
shows that regulation resulted in increased acceptance rates of unfair
offers. However, only reappraisal was effective in increasing acceptance
rates of very unfair offers. Unfair offers elicited greater right insula activation compared to fair offers. Regarding the regulation of unfair offers
specifically we observed increased caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex activation in the reappraisal condition and increased activation in
Brodmann Area 44/45 in the verbalizing condition. Reappraisal compared to no regulation resulted in a greater left insula response for reappraisal. Verbalizing compared to no regulation resulted in increased
subgenual anterior cingulate extending into the putamen for no regulation. Regarding skin conductance, responses were reduced in the reappraisal versus no regulation and verbalizing condition (during
verbalizing three participants even showed increased responses). These
data not only extend our current knowledge on emotion regulation to
social interactions, it suggests that different regulatory techniques are
associated with specific neural and psychophyiological responses and
that some may be more beneficial than others when dealing with adverse
events in social settings.

Benjamin Bushong , Matthew Rabin , Antonio Rangel ; California Institute of
Technology, 2University of California, Berkeley — The existence of costly
altruism has long been a puzzle to economists, psychologists and philosophers alike. In order to identify the neural correlates of other-regarding
preferences, we used fMRI to scan participants as they chose between
proposed payments to themselves and an anonymous partner. All
choices involved a tradeoff between selfish and generous outcomes. Our
results revealed two distinct neural systems supporting generous behavior. One network was characterized by sensitivity to one’s partner’s payoff in social cognition regions like the temporoparietal junction (TPJ).
Activation in this network correlated with greater generosity. A second
system was characterized by less generosity overall, longer reaction
times when choosing generously, and greater activation when choosing
generously in a region of right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) previously
associated with self-control (Hare et al., 2009). IFG showed negative connectivity with regions involved in valuation, such as the vmPFC, further
supporting its role in exerting control over reward computations in
order to yield generous behavior. To examine whether these systems

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

were associated with different underlying preferences, we randomly
vetoed participants’ choices on 40% of trials. Reward-related responses
in the vmPFC when generous choices were vetoed (resulting in the
unchosen but selfish outcome) were higher in participants activating the
IFG during generous choice, and lower in participants representing their
partner’s outcome in TPJ. These results suggest that participants choose
generously for different reasons: they may genuinely care about their
partner’s outcomes, or they may exert self-control in order to override
selfish impulses and make the “virtuous” choice.

Socializzazione, University of Padua, Padua, Italy — Gaze and emotional

expressions are two main cues in our social life. Together they convey
invaluable information about the direction of others’ attention, hence
about potentially relevant surrounding events and the affective value of
these events. In particular, it may be predicted that fearful (relative to
happy) gaze give rise to selective early effect of attention orienting as it
signals a potential threat in the environment. We tested this hypothesis
in 15 subjects with magnetoencephalography (MEG) (whole-head CTF
Omega 151 system). In each trial, a central face turned its gaze to the
right or the left and displayed a fearful or happy expression. After a random time interval (300-450ms), a target checkerboard appeared either at
the gazed-at (valid) or at the uncued (invalid) location. Attention orienting effect was defined as the difference in evoked magnetic responses to
valid versus invalid targets. The results showed a selective attention orienting effect induced by fearful gaze between 55 and 70ms. This effect
involved the left superior parietal lobule and lateral occipital cortex. This
is the first time that gaze cueing was combined with emotional faces in
an MEG study. The precocity of the attention orienting effect induced by
fearful gaze might subtend rapid detection and enhanced early processing of potential danger in the environment. This early effect involved
parietal regions which are well known to play an important role in attention as well as extrastriate regions likely to reflect the amplification of the
sensory processing of potentially relevant targets.

EXAMINING THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF EMOTION REGULATION:
EVIDENCE FROM LONGITUDINAL REAPPRAISAL PRACTICE IN
BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER PATIENTS Bryan T. Denny1,

Harold W. Koenigsberg2, Kevin N. Ochsner1; 1Columbia University, 2Mount
Sinai School of Medicine — A fundamental question involving emotion
regulation is whether one can improve with practice. This question is
particularly important for certain clinical populations, such as those with
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which exhibit difficulty in regulating emotion. We assessed whether training in cognitive reappraisal
(specifically, psychological distancing, where participants are instructed
to decrease their personal connection to a stimulus) would modulate
self-reports of negative emotion, psychophysiological arousal (via skin
conductance response), and brain activity (via fMRI) within an imagebased reappraisal task. We designed a reappraisal training paradigm in
which participants practiced implementing reappraisal strategies with
an experimenter and then performed a variant of an image-based reappraisal task (Ochsner et al., 2002, 2004) during five daily experimental
sessions. In the task, for each trial, participants saw one of two cues (DISTANCE or LOOK), followed by an image (negative or neutral) and then
a negative affect rating screen. On look trials participants were asked to
respond naturally. Trials were presented in a randomized order and
unique images were presented for all sessions. Results from 10 BPD par-

ticipants indicated that distancing training yielded reductions in negative affect ratings for Look-negative image trials over time and
reductions in skin conductance response for both Look-negative and
Reapp-negative trials. Preliminary fMRI results indicate that training is
associated with increased ventrolateral prefrontal activity at Session 5
relative to Session 1 when engaging in regulation relative to responding
naturally. Thus, distancing training has been shown to hold promise for
improving regulation in individuals with BPD.

DIFFUSE ATTENTION IS ELICITED BY FEARFUL, BUT NOT ANGRY FACIAL
EXPRESSIONS F. Caroline Davis1, Erika J. Ruberry2, Paul J. Whalen1;
1Dartmouth College, 2Cornell Medical School — Previous

research
has
focused on dimensions of valence (e.g., negativity) and emotional
arousal to delineate the effects of emotional cues on behavior. Here, we
explore the hypothesis that threat related facial expressions differentially
influence environmental monitoring. Fearful and angry facial expressions can be equated on valence and emotional arousal, but they differ in
the predictive information that they provide to viewers. Fearful faces
indicate the presence of a proximal, but unknown, threat, whereas angry
expressions embody a certain and direct threat. Thus, fearful faces
should facilitate processing of the environment to disambiguate the
threat, while angry faces should direct attention to the individual displaying the expression. Using a dot-probe paradigm, we presented pairs
of faces containing either a fearful and neutral face (FN), an angry and
neutral face (AN), or two neutral faces (NN). A dot-probe immediately
followed the faces, and reaction time to detect the probe was measured.
Consistent with previous research, participants were faster to detect
probes behind angry compared to neutral faces. In contrast, participants
displayed no reaction time bias toward the fearful compared to neutral
faces, consistent with the notion that fearful faces elicit a broadening of
attention that includes the fearful face and other environmental information. Across all three conditions, participants were fastest to detect
probes following Neutral faces in the FN trials compared to AN and NN
pairs. These data suggest that fearful faces uniquely diffuse attention for
all information in the experimental context, compared to angry facial
expressions, which capture and hold attention.

CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX TO
EMOTION REGULATION Amy Winecoff1, John Clithero1, Sara Bergman1,
Yizheng He1, McKell Carter1, Lihong Wang1, Scott Huettel1; 1Duke University —

The neural mechanisms of cognitive reappraisal, defined as the implementation of a cognitive strategy to regulate the emotional impact of a
stimulus, have been well characterized. The key success has been identifying the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in modulating amygdalar
responses during reappraisal of negative stimuli. Here, we investigated
the mechanisms of emotion regulation of positive and negative stimuli
in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. On half
the trials, participants (N =25) experienced their emotions naturally
(Experience Condition), while on the other half they attempted to emotionally detach themselves from their emotions (Reappraise Condition).
Participants rated the valence of each stimulus on each trial. When reappraising, participants activated the PFC and parietal regions. When
experiencing positively-rated stimuli, participants activated the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), a region implicated in integrating reward value
signals. Furthermore, reappraisal of positive stimuli led to decreased
vmPFC activation. Psychophysiological interaction analyses were used
to investigate functional connectivity of the vmPFC during emotion regulation. These analyses revealed that, during reappraisal, the vmPFC
was inversely connected to the superior frontal sulcus and the anterior
cingulate. These results indicate that a similar functional relationship
exists for modulation of the vmPFC during the regulation of positive
emotions as has been demonstrated for modulation of the amygdala during the regulation of negative emotions. Thus, the vmPFC may integrate
information about reappraisal by modulating value signals derived from
the experience of positive emotions.

ATTENTIONAL BIAS FOR TRAUMA-RELATED WORDS: EXAGGERATED
EMOTIONAL STROOP EFFECT IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN WAR
VETERANS WITH PTSD AND TBI Victoria Ashley1, Nikki Pratt1, Jary Larson1,
Timothy Justus1, Diane Swick1,2; 1VA Northern California Health Care System,
Martinez, CA, 2UC Davis — The emotional Stroop effect has been studied

extensively in patients with anxiety disorders and depression (Williams
et al., 1996), but less so in those with combat-related Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Constans et al., 2004). In PTSD, attention is
biased toward threat-related information relative to general emotional or
neutral information. To examine the role of threat-related information in
Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans with PTSD, we measured accuracy
and reaction times to color naming of combat-related words on an emotional Stroop task and administered the Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI) and the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Twelve of the 20 PTSD patients also
had mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), a common occurrence for recent
combat veterans. Groups included 20 PTSD/TBI patients (mean age: 32.1
yrs), 20 military controls (mean age: 33.5 yrs), and 20 civilian controls
(mean age: 32.1 yrs). The emotional Stroop task used 5 different blocks
(neutral, positive, negative, combat-related, and combat-matched neutral) of 84 unique words in a Latin-square counterbalanced order.
Results showed a clear emotional Stroop effect (slowing of RTs) for combat-related words in PTSD/TBI veterans (115 msec), but not in military
(21 msec) or civilian controls (34 msec), and more errors to combatrelated words in PTSD/TBI veterans than controls. Higher scores on the
PCL and BDI were also strongly correlated with slower RTs in the Stroop
task. The emotional Stroop test may show promise as an objective behavioral measure to distinguish between combat veterans with a PTSD diagnosis, and those without.

ATYPICAL AMYGDALA CONNECTIVITY DURING INVOLUNTARY EYE-GAZE

Xiaozhen You1, Lauren Kenworthy2, William Gaillard1,2, Chandan Vaidya1,2;
1Georgetown University, 2Children's National Medical Center — Children

with ASD show atypical functional activation when processing emotional expressions and eye gaze. One locus of atypicality is the
amygdala, which often shows increased response to emotional faces in
ASD. It is unknown whether amygdala functional connectivity with
regions involved in cognitive control (anterior cingulate) and encoding
of socio-emotional cues (superior temporal sulcus) is atypical in ASD.
We examined this in a Stroop-like task in which 7-13 year-old ASD and
control children viewed negative faces with eyes gazing congruently,
incongruently, or centrally (neutral) with words “RIGHT or LEFT” on
their foreheads. Subjects classified word direction, ignoring eye gaze.
Involuntary attention to eye gaze is beneficial on congruent trials (relative to Neutral) but interfering on incongruent (relative to Congruent)
trials; behavioral results confirmed this and groups did not differ. Psycho-physiological interaction analysis was conducted to identify connectivity with an amygdala seed region (based upon neutral>fixation
contrast activation) during Congruent>Neutral and Incongruent>Congruent contrasts. Two-sample t-tests at p<0.01 (corrected) showed that
during the Congruent>Neutral contrast (task-beneficial gaze processing), control subjects showed greater amygdala connectivity with the
right STS, a region previously implicated in gaze processing, while ASD
subjects showed greater amygdala connectivity with the ACC, a region
previously implicated in interference control. During Incongruent>Congruent contrast (task-distracting gaze processing), amygdala connectivity with ACC was greater than controls; no regions showed greater
connectivity in controls relative to ASD. Thus, amygdala connectivity
was reduced with a region important for gaze-processing and increased
with regions important for cognitive control in ASD children.

THE INTERPLAY OF MOOD AND THE PROCESSING OF

PSEUDOHOMOPHONES: EVIDENCE FROM N400 Constance

Netherlands, 2Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Centre for

Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands — Chwilla,

Virgillito, and Vissers (in press) demonstrated that mood affects how we
process meaning. In particular, we showed that the N400 cloze probability effect was reduced in a sad mood compared to a happy mood. In the
present study we investigated the effects of mood on the processing of
nonwords, in particular, of pseudohomophones. EEG was recorded
while female participants read high-cloze sentences and low-cloze sentences in which the highly expected or unexpected word was substituted
by a pseudohomophone which was phonologically identical to the
(un)expected word (“In that library the pupils borrow bouks ...” vs. “The
pillows are stuffed with bouks …’). Mood was manipulated by presenting short film clips that displayed fragments from a happy movie or a
sad movie. The mood induction was succesful: Participants were happier after watching the happy film clips than after watching the sad film
clips (p <.01). Mean N400 amplitude was significantly larger for the
high-cloze than for the low-cloze sentences, indicating that an N400
cloze probability effect for the pseudohomophones was obtained. The
cloze effect was widely distributed across the midline and the left and
right hemisphere. Crucially, the N400 cloze effect for pseudohomophones was not modulated by mood. Separate analyses for the two
mood conditions revealed an N400 cloze effect both for the happy and
for the sad mood (ps < .01). Thus, while pseudohomophones elicit an
N400 cloze effect the influence of a participant’s mood is restricted to
real words and does not occur for pseudohomophones.

COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL MODULATES EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS
AND EMOTIONAL MEMORY IN HEALTHY MEN AND WOMEN Hyeon Miin

An1, In Jae Hwang1, Ji woon Jung1, Kyung Hun Han1, Hyun Taek Kim1, Sang Hee
Kim1; 1Korea University — Cognitively reinterpreting emotional information has been known to modulate psychological and neural measures of
emotional arousal and have effects on episodic memory. We attempted
to investigate how cognitive emotion regulation would influence temporal unfolding of emotional processes using event- related potential (ERP)
techniques and change subsequent emotional memory. Healthy men and
women were recruited and completed an emotion regulation task which
included reinterpreting emotional scenes to increase or decrease emotional responses while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded
from 14 cortical sites. Online changes of subjective feelings of emotional
intensity and valence upon emotion regulation were recorded. Episodic
memory for the pictures was measured using free recall and recognition
tests with retention delay of 10 minutes and one week. The early posterior negativity (EPN) and late posterior potential (LPP) of ERP components were defined as the average ERP responses in the time windows of
200-300ms at O1 and O2, and 500-900ms at Pz, post-stimulus, respectively. Online ratings showed that, overall, reappraising to increase or
decrease emotional reactions increased and decreased subjective feelings
of arousal and valence. Overall, recall and recognition was enhanced for
pictures presented during the increase condition than those presented
during the decrease condition. Preliminary analyses on ERP data
showed that both EPN and LPP were greater for pictures presented during the regulation conditions than those during the watch condition. Our
results indicate that cognitive reappraisal of emotion influences both
early and later stage of emotion processing and has modulatory effect on
successful retrieval of emotional events.

ASSESSING THE WAY PEOPLE LOOK TO JUDGE THEIR INTENTIONS J.

Bruno Debruille1, Mathieu Brodeur1, Ursulla Hess2; 1McGill University,

2Humboldt University — Faces

of unknown persons are processed to infer
the intentions of these persons not only when they depict full-blown
emotions, but also at rest, or when these faces do no signal any strong
feelings. We explored the brain processes involved in these inferences to
test whether they are similar to those found when judging full-blown
emotions. We recorded the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited
by faces of unknown persons who, when they were photographed, were
not asked to adopt any particular expression. During the ERP recording,
participants had to decide whether each face appeared to be that of a
positively, negatively, ambiguously or neutrally intentioned person. The
early posterior negativity, the EPN, was found smaller for neutrally categorized faces than for the other faces, suggesting that the automatic processes it indexes are similar to those evoked by full-blown expressions
and thus that these processes might be involved in the decoding of intentions. In contrast, in the same 200-400 ms time window, ERPs were not
more negative at anterior sites for neutral faces. Second, the peaks of the
late positive potentials (LPPs) maximal at parietal sites around 700 ms
post-onset, were not significantly smaller for neutral faces. Third, the
slow positive waves that followed the LPP were larger for faces that took
more time to categorize, that is, for ambiguous faces. These three series
of unexpected results may indicate processes similar to those triggered
by full-blown emotions studies, but they question the characteristics of
these processes.

Randy Buckner2,3,4, Sunny Dutra5, Diego Pizzagalli1,2; 1McLean Hospital,
2Harvard Medical School, 3Harvard University, 4Athinoula A. Martinos Center,
Massachusetts General Hospital, 5Yale University — Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a significant public health problem, but the neurocognitive
mechanisms implicated in MDD remain poorly understood. One
hypothesis is that MDD attenuates emotional flexibility, truncating the
range of emotional experience. This study investigated whether MDD
compromises top-down control of emotions via reappraisal, and also
examined effects of MDD on memory. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, depressed adults (n = 13) and controls (n = 24) reappraised their responses to negative and neutral pictures by using mental
imagery to increase and decrease the pictures’ personal relevance. Two
weeks later, recognition memory was tested. Trial-by-trial valence ratings revealed that increasing and decreasing the personal relevance of
negative pictures intensified and reduced negative emotional experience, respectively. Moreover, a [negative/increase – negative/decrease]
contrast recruited brain regions associated with emotion regulation, selfreferential processing, and mental imagery—namely, the rostral cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral parietal lobes. Negative emotion enhanced memory accuracy for pictures recognized with high
confidence, but reappraisal did not affect memory. Surprisingly, depression did not influence these findings. However, there was a group difference in amygdala modulation by reappraisal. In controls, the [negative/
increase – negative/decrease] comparison revealed right amygdala activation, but this effect was absent in the MDD group. Region-of-interest
analyses revealed that this difference was restricted to negative trials,
and was not observed when neutral pictures were reappraised. Finally,
self-reported depressive symptoms correlated negatively with the
degree of right amygdala modulation by reappraisal. These results suggest weak top-down amygdala modulation in MDD, which could contribute to emotional inflexibility.

Neuroscience, National Central University, Taiwan, 2Institute of Linguistics,
Academia Sinica, Taiwan — Emotionally valenced materials are in general
better remembered and more resistant to intentional forgetting than neutral ones. It is however not clear whether emotional context modulates
the mnemonic and intentional forgetting processes in the same way as
emotional contents. The current study addressed this issue by examining
the item-method directed forgetting effect for neutral words embedded
in an emotional context. At study, a neutral or negative picture was presented and then a neutral word was superposed on the picture. Participants first made connections between the word and the picture. An R/F
cue then appeared to designate the neutral word to be remembered or
forgotten. At test, participants discriminated all studied words from
unstudied new words. A reduced directed forgetting effect was found
for items initially embedded in a negative context. The ERPs recorded at
study showed a late positive complex for negative pictures. A P3b-like
positivity was found for ERPs elicited by the R cues and this effect was
reduced when the preceding study item was embedded in a negative
context. In addition, a frontally distributed positivity was observed for F
cues in a later time window. This frontally distributed positivity was
also greater when the preceding study item was embedded in a negative
context. These results suggest that a greater attentional resource might
have been allocated to the negative context such that less effective mnemonic and intentional forgetting processes were engaged for items
embedded in negative context.

BRIEF MOTOR EXPERIENCE REVERSES VISUAL HEMIFIELD EFFECTS

Geoffrey Brookshire1, Daniel Casasanto1,2,3; 1Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, 2Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, &
Behaviour, Nijmegen, 3The New School for Social Research, New York — For
decades, visual hemifield (VHF) experiments have served as a behavioral window into hemispheric specialization. According to VHF studies
of emotion in right-handers, the left hemisphere is specialized for positive and approach emotions, and the right hemisphere for negative and
withdrawal emotions. VHF effects reverse in left-handers, suggesting a
reversed hemispheric organization of emotion. However, recent studies
reveal implicit associations between left-right space and emotional
valence, calling these conclusions about hemispheric specialization into
question. In right-handers, positive emotions are implicitly associated
with the right side, the side on which they can act more fluently with
their dominant hand, and negative emotions with the left side. In lefthanders, associations between space and valence are reversed. Since
VHF studies rely on lateralized stimulus presentation, emotional VHF
effects could arise due to fluency-based space-valence associations: not
to hemispheric specialization. Here we tested competing accounts of
emotional VHF effects by training natural right-handers to be transiently
left-handed. Participants categorized faces presented in the right or left
VHF as positive or negative. In Experiment 1, untrained right-handers
tended to judge neutral faces presented on the right as positive and on
the left as negative. Untrained left-handers showed the opposite pattern.
In Experiment 2, changes in motor fluency induced changes in righthanders’ VHF effects. After motor training, right-handers categorized
faces like natural left-handers. In light of these results, emotional VHF
effects can no longer be interpreted as evidence for hemispheric specialization of emotions. Asymmetries in motor fluency can determine spacevalence associations and reverse emotional VHF effects.

RACIAL IDENTIFICATION MODULATES DEFAULT NETWORK ACTIVITY FOR
SAME- AND OTHER-RACES Vani Mathur1, Tokiko Harrada2, Joan Chiao1;
1Northwestern University, 2Nagoya University — Racial

identification shapes
self-concept and how people interact with and interpret the social world
around them. Prior neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the role of
the neural default network in self-referential processing. However, how
racial identification affects neural processing of social information
remains unknown. Here we examined the effect of racial identification

118

on neural response related to social perception among African American
and Caucasian American individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results demonstrate that degree of racial identification predicts activity within cortical midline structures of the default
network in response to viewing racial ingroup, relative to outgroup
members, and activity within the medial temporal lobe subsystem of the
default network in response to viewing racial outgroup, relative to
ingroup members. Broadly, our findings suggest that strength of racial
identification is associated with differential recruitment of neural and
cognitive processes to understand and respond to other people within
and outside of one’s racial group.

THE ROLE OF INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS IN THE EMOTIONAL COST OF
TEMPORAL ATTENTION Emma Ferneyhough1, Caroline H. McClave1,
Elizabeth A. Phelps1; 1New York University — The attentional blink (AB) task

assesses the temporal limitations of attention. In a rapid visual serial presentation, identifying a target stimulus impairs identification of a second
target stimulus that follows soon after (early lag), but not later (late lag).
Emotion has been shown to influence temporal attention in two ways: 1)
an emotional second target facilitates attention, and 2) an emotional first
target impairs attention. Previous research has explored the neural systems of emotion’s facilitation of temporal attention. The goal of the
present study was to explore the neural systems linked to the emotional
cost of temporal attention. While the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) has been
implicated in spatial attention costs observed with emotion, the present
task explores the role of IPS in emotional costs of temporal attention. We
recruited 15 participants for an AB task in which emotional or neutral
distracter words appeared 3, 4, 7 or 8 lags prior to a single neutral target.
Lags 3 and 4 were within the AB window (270, 360ms respectively)
whereas lags 7 and 8 appeared outside (630, 720ms respectively). Participants provided self-report trait anxiety measures. Consistent with prior
research, trait anxiety correlated with fronto-parietal networks implicated in attention capture by emotion, indicating that high-trait anxious
individuals may be more susceptible to emotional costs. Moreover, we
observed differential activation in the IPS for early lags in the emotion
compared to neutral condition. Thus, IPS may play a role in attentional
costs with emotion, not only in spatial, but also temporal domains.

EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE APPRAISAL AND ACTION MODALITY ON

Psychology and Neurocognition Laboratory, CNRS, Université Pierre Mendès
France, Grenoble, France — Our study aimed to determinate the evoked

response potentials (ERP) underlying the influence of cognitive
appraisal and action modality on emotional processing of information in
video game players. Thirteen video games players and eleven non-players visualized emotionally positive and negative natural scenes and carried out six tasks in which modalities of the following variables were
crossed: cognitive appraisal (perception / affective categorisation),
motor emotional categorisation (random / emotional motor categorization) and action modality (button / joystick). Our study revealed higher
amplitudes of visual components P1 and N1, a higher latency of N1 and
a lower amplitude and a shorter latency of the P2 component during
cognitive appraisal of negative situations essentially. These results suggest that categorisation tasks involve an increased attentional cost, selective attention, effortful processing and increased attentiveness. Players
showed lower amplitudes of N70, N1 and P2 and a shorter latency of N1
comparatively to non-players. The attenuation of N70 and N1 latency
may reflect structural encoding and broader and coarser processing of
images in players. However, an early effect of action modality was
observed with a higher N70 for the joystick, particularly in players. The
reduction of N1 and P2 suggest an increased and shared attentiveness
which will be equivalent between the perception task and categorisation
in players as evidenced by the N1 delay observed between these tasks.

INTENSITY OF NEGATIVE EMOTION PREDICTS SELF-REGULATORY SKILLS
IN DREAMING (BUT NOT WAKING) Tracey Kahan1, Kelly Bulkeley2, Nader

Kawadri1; 1Santa Clara University, 2Graduate Theological Union — Some theorists claim that dreaming serves to regulate emotion (e.g., Kramer, 1991).
We tested two hypotheses derived from this claim. First, dream experiences should be rated as more emotionally intense than comparably
sampled waking experiences (Hyp 1). Second, the relationship between
emotion, self-monitoring, and self-regulation should be stronger for
dreaming than for waking experiences)(Hyp 2). Parallel samples of
dreaming and waking were obtained via experimental interruptions of
late-night sleep and ongoing waking experience. Participants rated the
subjective qualities of these experiences via two questionnaires used in
prior research (Kahan, 1994; Kahan & LaBerge, 1996; 2010). Contrary to
Hyp 1, M ratings of emotional intensity for dreaming and waking experiences did not differ statistically. Further, participants gave higher ratings to positive emotions than negative emotions. However, a
statistically significant interaction revealed that dreaming experiences
were rated as less positive and more negative than waking experiences,
F(1, 169) = 74.61, MSE = .66, p < .001. To test Hyp 2, we computed the
correlations (Pearson’s r) between participants’ ratings of positive and
negative emotions and self-regulation (reported monitoring of one’s
reactions, monitoring of the external environment, and self-regulation of
thought or behavior). Consistent with Hyp 2, the reported intensity of
negative emotion in dreaming was strongly related to all three self-regulatory activities; no such relationship was observed for waking experiences. Thus, although dreaming may not involve generally heightened
emotional activation, there may be a stronger relationship between (negative) affect and the cognitive skills involved in self-regulation in dreaming than in waking.

MUSIC, AROUSAL, AND SPATIAL MEMORY: AN INVESTIGATION USING
EEG Branden Kolarik1, Geisler Mark1, Propper Ruth2, Lester Ken1; 1San
Francisco State University, 2Montclair State University — Previous

research
suggests that music can be effective in influencing arousal levels (Rickard, 2004; Lundqvist et al., 2009). In addition, Brunye et al., 2009; Gable &
Harmon-Jones, 2010 have shown that arousal levels can modulate spatial
memory. This study investigates the role arousal plays in the construction and maintenance of spatial memory using music as a means of
arousal manipulation while recording Electroencephalography (EEG)
from front right (F4) and front left (F3) recording sites as well as recording Skin Conductance Responses (SCR) and Heart Rate (HR). 15 participants listened to two 2-minute music clips, one rated high and one rated
low arousing before memorizing a rudimentary map. Participants later
responded to questions about the relative locations of landmarks on the
map. The question types were either short, medium, or long inter-landmark distances. EEG (Global, Alpha and Beta Power), SCR, and HR were
recorded throughout. Given the previous findings, we hypothesized that
music type would influence the amount of short or long distance questions answered correctly, in that following high arousal, more long distance questions would be answered correctly. Conversely, following the
low arousal song, more short distance relations should be remembered.
Preliminary analyses show an effect of music type on the number of long
and short distance questions answered correctly, as well as a main effect
of music type on EEG Power. We also show that increases in the differences in hemispheric EEG Power and increases in SCR and HR were positively correlated with participants subjective ratings of arousal level.

tion to subjects. FMRI studies have implicated the nucleus accumbens
(NAcc) in the anticipation of diverse rewards and the experience of positive and aroused affect (Knutson et al., 2001). We sought to determine
whether subjects (n=24) could use affect-based mental strategies in the
context of neurofeedback to modulate their NAcc activity. In the task,
subjects were asked to develop mental strategies to increase and
decrease positive arousal. During FMRI scanning, subjects were then
cued to either increase or decrease their NAcc activation. On-line algorithms presented the dynamic NAcc signal to the subjects as they implemented their strategies. Subjects were able to use neurofeedback to
significantly increase and decrease NAcc activation. Additional analyses
suggested that control diminished in the absence of feedback, and that
the most robust modulation occurred during the first few seconds of cue
presentation. Functional connectivity analyses suggested that medial
prefrontal cortex recruitment correlated with successful NAcc neurofeedback-based modulation. In addition to supporting an anticipatory
affect account of NAcc activity, these findings suggest that humans can
use FMRI-based neurofeedback to control NAcc activity.

ACUTE STRESS AND ERP CORRELATES OF ATTENTION TO ALCOHOL
IMAGES IN SOCIAL DRINKERS Reiko Graham1, Ryan Giuliano2, Laura

Kaufman1, Nicole Wicha2, Natalie Ceballos1; 1Texas State University,
2University of Texas – San Antonio — This study examined the effects of
acute stress on event-related potentials (ERPs) to images of alcohol and
objects using a 3-stimulus oddball paradigm. Seventy-five participants
were assigned to either an alcohol- or object-target condition while ERPs
were measured before and after an acute stressor or control task. Separate analyses were conducted on the peak latencies and amplitudes of
the P2, N2 and P3. Results indicated that stress significantly decreased
the latencies of the N2 and P3, whereas P2 latency was not moderated by
stress. Notably, stress related decreases in P3 latency were observed for
both object and alcohol targets, as well as alcohol non-targets. Amplitudes of the P2 were larger for alcohol images and were enhanced for all
image types after the stressor. P2/N2 amplitude changes were not sensitive to image type, but were enhanced after the stressor. N2/P3 amplitudes were not sensitive to stress, but were enhanced to alcohol images,
especially after repetition. In summary, P2 amplitudes were enhanced by
stress and motivational significance independently, whereas changes in
N2 latencies and amplitudes were primarily stress-related. P3 latencies
were shorter to targets and nontarget alcohol images after stress; amplitudes of the P3 were not sensitive to stress, but were enhanced by alcohol
images and object targets. These findings suggest that stress may influence the early stages of alcohol-related processing, an effect that may be
particularly apparent in ERP latencies. P3 amplitude, associated with
controlled processing, was resistant to stress and may represent a trait
response to addiction-related stimuli.

EMOTION REGULATION OF TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP GENERATED
EMOTIONS Kateri McRae1, Supriya Misra2, Aditya K. Prasad2, Sean C.

Pereira2, James J. Gross2; 1The University of Denver, 2Stanford University —

Current theories of emotion suggest that emotions may be generated by
the perception of low-level features of the stimulus itself (e.g., properties
of the eyes in an emotional face) or the appraisal of the meaning of a
stimulus considering the larger context within which an individual is
operating (e.g., knowledge that a neutral face hides disappointment).
The present study examined the effects of cognitive reappraisal when
performed upon emotions generated in these two ways. Twenty-four
women were scanned on a 3-Tesla GE magnet while viewing top-down
and bottom-up emotional stimuli under instructions to respond naturally or to use cognitive reappraisal to decrease negative affect. Previously reported self-report and amygdala data indicate that reappraisal is
more effective for top-down generated emotions, and may result in paradoxical increases in amygdala activation for bottom-up generated emotions. During reappraisal, medial prefrontal regions showed greater
activation during natural responding to top-down generated emotions

and during reappraisal of both top-down and bottom-up generated emotions, but were not recruited during bottom-up emotion generation. In
addition, the reappraisal of top-down generated emotions resulted in
greater activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex and the caudate/
ventral striatum than the reappraisal of bottom-up generated emotions.
Reappraisal of bottom-up generated emotions recruited more right lateral prefrontal cortex activation and resulted in greater down-regulation
of the insula and visual cortex than the reappraisal of top-down generated emotions. Taken together, this implies that the different cognitive
processes (and potentially specific strategies) are engaged during the
reappraisal of top-down and bottom-up generated emotions.

pleasant or unpleasant words. This suggests that self-relevance can lead
to further attentional allocation and additional analysis at post-lexical
stages of processing, but only when such resources have not already
been captured by emotional valence.

eight subtests. In prosodic subtests, participants hear a series of sentences and identify the emotion conveyed in the tone of voice (i.e. happy,
sad, angry, frightened, neutral). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting state data was also collected from 15 PD subjects and 14 controls to
assess alpha band (8-12Hz) coherence. CATS data revealed that PD subjects had specific impairment in prosodic emotion recognition. When
divided into left-side (of body) (N=8) vs. right-side (N=8) disease severity dominant, subjects with left-side dominant PD showed deficits in
subtests Name Emotional Prosody (p=.05) and Conflicting Prosody and
Meaning (p=.03). MEG data revealed that PD subjects had significantly
decreased functional connectivity compared to controls in regions
involved with emotion processing: anterior insula, Brodmann area (BA)

decreased functional connectivity in superior temporal gyrus BA22
(p=.04), BA13 (p=.02), and BA 24 & 25 (p=.03) compared to right-side
dominant PD (N=8). Our findings suggest that disruption of BGthalamocortical loops results in changes in perception of emotional prosody.

Many veterans returned from the 1991 Persian Gulf War with symptom
complexes that have been referred to as Gulf War Illness. While many
have attributed these symptoms to postwar stress, other studies have
attributed the psychological, somatic, and cognitive symptoms to the
results of deployment-related exposures. An exaggerated response to
emotional stimuli is widely reported by returning Gulf War Veterans.
Such hyperarousability is not only a principal marker of PTSD but is also
observed among individuals with disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and depression, as well as among those
with traumatic brain injuries. In order to assess the hyperarousal symptom of Gulf War Illness, we analyzed event-related potential data of 30
Gulf War veterans, some of whom met Haley criteria for syndromes of
Gulf War Illness, collected during their performance of visual and auditory three-condition oddball tasks where threatening stimuli were the
novel probes. Reported hyperarousal of the ill veterans was significantly
greater than that of the control veterans, but different ERP profiles
emerged to explain hyperarousability in the different syndromes. Relative to controls, Syndromes 2 and 3 showed significantly higher early
components, purported to indicate compromised inhibitory gating, and
Syndromes 1 and 2 showed higher responses to task-irrelevant novel
threatening stimuli (P3a) than to the task-relevant target stimuli (P3b),
purported to indicate dysfunctional attentional control.

Wonja M. Fairbrother1, Gina R. Kuperberg1,2; 1Tufts University, 2Massachusetts
General Hospital — Accurately communicating self-relevant and emotional information is a vital function of language. Despite this, we have
little idea about how these factors impact normal discourse comprehension, either independently or in combination. In an event related potential (ERP) study, we fully crossed self-relevance and emotional valence
in a discourse context. Two-sentence scenarios were either in 3rd or 2nd
person (previous work has shown grammatical person modulates the
perspective from which mental models are built; Brunyé et al., 2009). A
critical word toward the end of the second sentence was pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant, e.g., "A man knocks on Sandra’s/your hotel room
door. She/You see that he has a gift/tray/gun in his hand". ERPs
recorded on this critical word showed a larger P2 in self-relevant than
non-self-relevant scenarios, suggesting that, regardless of emotional
valence, self-relevant discourse can enhance attention to words during
early stages of processing. In addition, unpleasant words evoked a larger
Late Positivity than pleasant or neutral words, indicating that, regardless
of self-relevance, negatively valenced words can capture attention and
trigger additional analysis at post-lexical stages of processing. Finally,
self-relevance and valence interacted on the Late Positivity: whereas a
larger Late Positivity was evoked by neutral words in self-relevant than
non-self-relevant scenarios, no such effect of self-relevance was seen on

PRIMING AND PROSODY: INTERACTIONS BETWEEN VISUAL PRIMING,

interpretation of emotional prosody modified by differences in one’s
visual environment? And, if so, to what extent are these modifications
related to the activity of the autonomic nervous system? The present
study examines the dynamic nature of this modality of nonverbal communication. University undergraduates (n = 30) were asked to interpret
the intended meanings of hundreds of nonsense utterances based on the
inflection and intonation of the speaker's voice. The utterances expressed
12 intended meanings - anger, disgust, empathy, fear, forgiveness, happiness, pride, questioning, relief, sadness, shame and surprise. Participants were exposed to and interviewed about these utterances in both of
two priming conditions - one in which the visual presentation of a neutral face (33ms) directly preceded the utterance and one in which a fearful face preceded the utterance (also 33ms). Recordings were made of the
participants’ physiological responses during testing. Significant main
effects were found for intended meaning and visual stimulus condition;
there was also an interaction between the two factors. Physiological data
was used to calculate sympathovagal balance (SVB), and was then correlated with the data from the interpretation task; significant associations
were found between measures of SVB and response behavior.

Brito1, Eamon McCrory1, Essi Viding1; 1University College London, 2Indiana
University, 3Birkbeck College — Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to
attribute thoughts, intentions and beliefs to others. This involves component processes, including cognitive perspective taking (cognitive ToM)
and understanding emotions (affective ToM). This study assessed the
distinction and overlap of neural processes involved in these respective
components, and also investigated their development between adolescence and adulthood. While data suggest that ToM develops between
adolescence and adulthood, these populations have not been compared
on cognitive and affective ToM domains. Using fMRI with 15 adolescent
(aged 11-16) and 15 adult (aged 24-40) males, we assessed neural
responses during cartoon vignettes requiring cognitive ToM, affective
ToM, or physical causality comprehension (control). An additional aim
was to explore relationships between fMRI data and self-reported empathy. Both cognitive and affective ToM conditions were associated with
neural responses in the classic ToM network across both groups,
although only affective ToM recruited medial/ventromedial PFC
(mPFC/vmPFC). Adolescents additionally activated vmPFC more than
did adults during affective ToM. The specificity of the mPFC/vmPFC
response during affective ToM supports evidence from lesion studies
suggesting that vmPFC may integrate affective information during ToM.
Furthermore, the differential neural response in vmPFC between adult
and adolescent groups indicates developmental changes in affective
ToM processing.

EXPECTED REWARD MODULATES PRESTIMULUS ENCODING-RELATED
THETA ACTIVITY Matthias Gruber1, Andrew Watrous2, Charan Ranganath2,

Arne Ekstrom2, Leun Otten1; 1University College London, 2University of
California, Davis — Oscillatory brain activity in the theta frequency range
(4-8 Hz) is thought to play a pivotal role in memory encoding. Recent
findings indicate that theta activity before the onset of an item can influence the likelihood of successful encoding. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to test whether theta activity can be engaged
dynamically to promote verbal memory encoding. Two experiments
were performed in which participants intentionally encoded a series of
words. Each word was preceded by a cue that indicated the amount of
money that would be earned if the word were successfully remembered
in a later recognition test. Each word also required an alphabetic judgment to ensure equal attention to all words during encoding. Low and
high reward cues were intermixed in Experiment 1, while only high
reward cues were presented in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, prestimulus theta activity at frontal scalp sites was sensitive to reward amount,
predicting later memory performance only in the high reward condition.
In Experiment 2, theta activity was related to the extent to which participants allocated sufficient cognitive resources toward encoding of the
items. Encoding-related prestimulus activity was inversely related to
accuracy on the concurrent alphabetic task. These findings are consistent
with the idea that theta activity plays a dynamic, voluntary role in memory encoding. Engaging such activity may depend on the degree to
which encoding is emphasized.

FUNCTIONAL PARCELLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHT INSULA USING
RESTING STATE FMRI Luke Chang1, Mel Win Khaw2, Alan Sanfe1,3;
1University of Arizona, 2Duke University, 3Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition

and Behavior, Radboud University — While the insula has been implicated
in a number of disparate functions including interoception, affect, pain,
empathy, and error processing, there have been only a handful of metaanalyses examining whether these functions localize to specific insular
subregions. We predicted that these subregions should be differentially
connected with the rest of the brain based on their purported functions.
Importantly, we hypothesized that these functional networks should be
evident even when the specific function is not being directly experimentally induced. To test this hypothesis, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to anatomically parcellate the insula based on shared

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

patterns of connectivity across the brain while participants were at
“rest”. We then used a multi-level multiple regression approach to isolate the networks that were independently functionally coupled to each
subregion and spatially consistent across participants. Our data-driven
procedure revealed three distinct regions that were spatially consistent
with the cytoarchitectural divisions and anatomical tracings reported in
primates as well as recent meta-analyses of the function of the insula.
Moreover, these subregions were coupled to networks that are consistent
with their purported function. For example, the ventroanterior insula
was functionally connected to limbic areas, the dorsoanterior insula was
connected to cognitive regions, and the posterior insula was connected
to somatosensory/motor areas. These results suggest that the insula is
indeed functionally subdivided into at least three distinct regions and
plays an integral role in the integration of emotional, sensory, and cognitive information.

WHITE AND GREY MATTER VOLUMES CORRELATE WITH DELAY
DISCOUNTING: A VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY STUDY Rongjun Yu1,

Dean Mobbs1, Elisabeth A. H. von dem Hagen1, Andrew J Calder1; 1MRC
Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK — A preference for immediate gratification or inability to delay reward is a central feature in
addictive processes. However, the neural structures underlying reward
delay tolerance are still unclear. Healthy participants (n=121) completed
a delay discounting questionnaire assessing the extent to which they prefer smaller immediate rewards to larger delayed reward after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Whole brain voxelbased morphometry analysis shows that delay discounting rates were
negatively correlated with white matter volume in frontal cortex and
positively correlated with white matter volume in hippocampus. Our
study provides further evidence that individual differences in delay discounting are associated with the volume of specific brain structures. It
highlights the possibility that our ability to tolerant reward delay may be
associated with brain regions implicated in executive control and temporal estimation. This study might better our understanding of the neural
basis of impulsivity and addiction.

ERP EVIDENCE FOR VERY EARLY GATING OF FACIAL EXPRESSION
PROCESSING BY SUSTAINED ATTENTION David J Acunzo1, Graham

MacKenzie1, Mark van Rossum1; 1University of Edinburgh — The first visual
event-related potential (ERP) component C1 (50-100 ms post-stimulus
onset) has recently been reported to be sensitive to emotional stimuli as
well as sustained attention. In particular, some results suggest that emotional faces generate an increase in the amplitude of C1, compared with
neutral faces. Here we present two ERP studies investigating the effects
of fearful faces on C1 amplitude. In both experiments, participants stared
at a fixation point while faces were presented in the upper left or right
hemifield. In experiment 1, a central cue pointing left or right preceded
the display of fearful, neutral and happy faces; participants were
instructed to detect happy faces at the cued location (valid trials) by a
button-press. In experiment 2, participants had to detect a change of
colour of the fixation point while neutral and fearful faces were presented upright or inverted. In experiment 1, we found a significant main
effect of emotion (p < 0.01) on C1 amplitude, but no effect of validity;
however, we found a significant modulation by emotion for valid, but
not for invalid trials. In experiment 2, no modulation of C1 amplitude by
emotion was found for either upright or inverted faces. Our results confirm that facial expression can modulate C1 amplitude, but suggest that
if attention is drawn away from the facial stimuli, this modulation disappears. This study provides evidence for a very early gating of facial
expression processing by sustained attention.

EFFECTS OF STRESS INDUCTION ON FUNCTIONAL BRAIN CONNECTIVITY

Neuroscience Center, University of Geneva, Switzerland — Spontaneous patterns of functional brain connectivity during resting are altered in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here we studied how resting network
connectivity differs between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
patients and healthy controls, and how it is modulated by stress induction. We acquired functional MRI (fMRI) data during a ‘classical’ resting
state condition and when resting state was associated with stress induction. First we determined regions of interest (ROIs) using independent
component analysis (ICA). We then used wavelet-based correlations to
assess functional connectivity between these regions for slow and fast
frequency ranges of fMRI signal. Bootstrapping statistics revealed distinct networks between groups (OCD vs controls) and conditions (resting state vs induction). During resting state, OCD patients (vs controls)
showed increased connectivity between striatum, ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and insular regions, selectively for fast oscillations (0.14-0.28 Hz). By contrast, at slow oscillations (0.02-0.04 Hz),
controls (vs patients) showed increased connectivity in the default-mode
network. Stress induction enhanced connectivity between the caudate,
insula and ACC in OCD patients, while connectivity within a network
encompassing VMPFC and nucleus accumbens was strengthened in the
controls. These effects were found for fast oscillations of fMRI signal.
This pattern of results suggests that the pathophysiology of OCD may
involve disturbances across multilayered neural networks oscillating at
different frequencies that are related to motivation and the regulation of
internal states (providing an increased emotional vulnerability to
patients). Such disturbances were partially mimicked by a stress induction procedure in the controls, providing neural evidence for increased
stress-eliciting thoughts in OCD.

Although there have been important advances in the treatment of
depression, e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), many depressed
individuals do not have the resources to obtain treatment. Investigators
have begun to examine how interacting with nature (e.g., walking in a
park) can improve cognitive functioning. In the present study we
explored whether interacting with nature may benefit participants diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Ten healthy control (HC)
participants and ten participants experiencing MDD participated in our
study. We assessed participants’ mood and working memory spans, and
they then recalled a negative memory. Participants then walked for 50
minutes either in the Ann Arbor Arboretum (a natural setting) or in
downtown Ann Arbor (an urban setting). Participants returned from
their walk and we assessed their mood and working memory spans
again. Participants returned to the lab one week later and repeated the
same procedure, but walked in the other location. Both groups improved
their memory spans more when walking in nature vs. in the urban setting, but the effect was stronger for the MDD participants. In addition,
although both groups showed reductions in worry when walking MDDs
showed larger decreases in worry especially when walking in the nature
setting vs. the urban setting. Moreover, improvement in working memory span was correlated with decreases in worry. These results indicate

122

that interacting with nature may be a therapeutic intervention for individuals suffering from MDD.

Beversdorf1; 1University of Missouri, Columbia, 2Central Methodist
University — Psychological stress has a significant impact on health, and

stress also affects cognitive performance, which appears to be mediated
by the noradrenergic system. Our previous work demonstrated that
drugs affecting the noradrenergic system influence functional connectivity, and we wish to determine how stress may affect these networks and
how this influence may be altered based on genetics. The first step in this
line of research is to determine how stress affects these networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized, and functional
connectivity was assessed during tasks with and without stressors. Testing consisted of administration of semantic categorization tasks across
two separate scan sessions: one in which subjects were given the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) and another scan that served as a control. Preliminary results reveal a main effect of decreased functional
connectivity across all language network system ROI pairs during stress
as compared to no stress. Regions of interest were localized to the fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal
cortex. These findings begin to reveal how stress impacts cognitive performance on tasks involving the language networks, and show that
stress influences the activity pattern of functionally associated brain
regions. Further study of the interaction between this finding and genes
that influence stress reactivity, such as the SLC6A4 gene which is
involved with the expression and function of the serotonin transporter
(5-HTT), is warranted.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL EXECUTIVE CONTROL TASK TO INVESTIGATE
COGNITIVE CONTROL OVER WORRY Lauren Hallion1, Amishi Jha2;
1University of Pennsylvania, 2University of Miami — Uncontrollable

anxious
thought is a central feature of many anxiety disorders. However, little is
known about the prefrontal executive control processes (ECPs) that
underlie the ability to control worry and other anxious thoughts. Identifying the cognitive underpinnings of control over worry is an important
step toward explaining why some individuals suffer from uncontrollable
worry. The aims of the present study were to: 1) develop the Working
memory, Inhibition, and Switching Task (WIST), a continuous performance task that simultaneously assesses these three ECPs hypothesized
to be involved in emotion regulation; 2) investigate the role of these
ECPs in control over worry; and 3) explore the relationship between trait
worry and ECP use. In the WIST, participants must maintain and update
representations of recently presented stimuli (WM); inhibit prepotent
responses (Inhibition); and periodically change the stimuli to which they
respond (Switching). Each ECP is assessed under high and low demand
conditions. Healthy undergraduates (N=47) completed the WIST while
controlling worry and neutral thought (counterbalanced). Patterns of
performance on the WIST were comparable to established assessments
of each ECP, with higher demands associated with lower accuracy. The
accuracy efficiencies for each ECP were uncorrelated, suggesting independence. Worry was associated with slower reaction times (RTs).
Higher levels of trait worry were unrelated to WM and Switching but
were associated with slower RTs during high Inhibition demand. These
findings suggest that the WIST is a viable method of simultaneously
assessing these ECPs, and that induced and high trait worry place a substantial demand on ECPs.

THE EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL DISTINCTIVENESS AND EMOTIONAL
DISTINCTIVENESS ON RECALL – A SUBSEQUENT MEMORY STUDY Siri-

Maria Kamp1, Ashley Gruber1, Nasreen Sadeq1, Glen Forester1, Emanuel
Donchin1; 1University of South Florida — Von Restorff (1933) showed that
physically distinct words (“isolates”) are better recalled. Isolates also
elicit a P300. It has been demonstrated (Karis et al. 1984) that the amplitude of the P300 is correlated with subsequent recall when the participant uses rote memory, rather than elaborative memorization strategies.
We investigated whether isolation due to emotional content will display
a similar “subsequent memory effect”. In experiment 1, participants
studied lists of positive words, lists of negative words, and neutral word
lists. In different neutral lists we embedded physical, positive, or negative isolates. Recall was tested immediately after the presentation of each
list. For physical isolates and negative emotional isolates, recall was
enhanced. Furthermore, physical isolates and negative isolates both elicited a P300. In experiment 2, study lists included only neutral words and
one negative isolate. For a cluster of participants who better recalled the
negative isolates, the isolates elicited a centro-parietal P300. For these
participants, negative isolates that elicited a larger P300 were less likely
to be recalled than isolates eliciting a smaller P300. This pattern is the
reverse of the previously reported P300 subsequent memory effect for
physically isolated items. Across participants, the amplitude of an additional, parieto-occipital positivity elicited by negative isolates was negatively correlated with subsequent recall of all words in the middle serial
positions of the same list. Based on these results, the cognitive mechanisms that lead to the enhancing effects of physical isolation and isolation due to negative emotional content on recall appear to be different.

WINNERS TAKE MORE, LOSERS TAKE LESS: EMOTIONALLY AROUSING
SOUNDS AMPLIFY DIFFERENCES IN PERCEPTUAL SALIENCE AMONG
COMPETING VISUAL STIMULI Matthew Sutherland1, Mara Mather1,2;
1University

of Southern California, Department of Psychology, 2The USC Davis
School of Gerontology — In two experiments, 150 participants (ages 18-30)

performed a visual identification task to test the hypothesis that emotional arousal increases attention to high priority visual stimuli and
inhibits attention to low priority visual stimuli. In each trial a circular
array of letters was briefly presented following exposure to negative
arousing or neutral sounds. Contrast level was manipulated to make
some letters higher in priority. Emotionally arousing sounds increased
identification rates for high contrast (dark grey) letters and decreased
identification rates for low contrast (light grey) letters. Manipulating the
time between a sound and the subsequent letter display revealed that
arousal increased the salience of high contrast letters and decreased the
salience of low contrast letters in the first 3000 milliseconds after the
sound, but not after that critical period. These findings support our
arousal-biased competition hypothesis (Mather & Sutherland, in press),
which predicts that emotional arousal acts to amplify biased competition
processes in selective attention, producing a “winner-take-more losertake-less” effect when processing competing stimuli.

Females are, compared to males, more accurate at labeling negative

tive stimuli, as indexed by the LPP (Late-Positive Potential; a long lasting
centro-parietal positivity starting at 400ms post stimulus onset). , This
pattern of ‘attending to the negative’ is also seen in participants with
higher levels of trait anxiety however, suggesting that putative gender
differences could simply reflect underlying differences in anxiety
between the genders. To rule out this potential confound we assessed
anxiety in 24 participants (12 female), allowing us to examine gender differences whilst matching for anxiety. EEG was recorded while participants viewed 222 pictures from the International Affective Picture
System (IAPS), including 74 highly arousing negative, 74 highly arousing positive and 74 low arousing neutral according to IAPS standard ratings. As previously demonstrated, we found that negative images
elicited significantly larger LPPs in females than males, while LPP amplitudes did not differ between the genders for neutral or positive images.
Importantly, because the genders did not differ in anxiety, our results
suggest a genuine gender difference in affective picture processing
beyond simple differences in anxiety.

LOOK AWAY: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CATECHOL-OMETHYLTRANSFERASE VAL158MET GENOTYPE AND VALENCE IN
SPATIAL DISENGAGEMENT PROCESSES Kathrin
Gschwendtner1,

Andreas Reif1, Andreas Mühlberger2, Andrea Kübler2, Claudia Sommer1,
Martin J. Herrmann1; 1University Hospital of Wuerzburg, 2University of
Wuerzburg — Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme, which
degrades dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the COMT gene leads to a substitution of
methionine for valine at the codon 158 which results in a more thermolabile enzyme. An ERP-study showed that methionine carriers have a
higher Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) for negative pictures. Since this
EPN indexes an attentional bias we hypothesized that methionine carriers disengage slower from negative pictures using spatial disengagement as behavioural operationalisation of the attentional bias. In a forced
disengagement eye-tracking task emotional pictures were shown to 43
participants stratified for the COMT-Val158Met-Polymorphism. The
time period until the subjects had to disengage was varied. Contrary to
the postulated hypothesis an u-shaped relation between the polymorphism and the latency of the disengagement movement was found.
While heterozygote participants showed no difference in disengaging
from positive compared to negative pictures, homozygote participants
disengaged slower from negative pictures. The results also revealed that
participants needed longer to disengage from negative pictures compared to positive pictures when the disengagement movement had to be
conducted shortly after the onset of the picture. If this time period was
extended, this difference disappeared. The mid-level dopamine concentration of the heterozygote participants seems to result in an optimal
functioning to conduct the task – irrelevant of the valence of the presented picture. We speculate that if participants had more time to prepare the movement they were able to use regulation strategies to
disengage as fast from negative as from positive pictures.

acoustic regions including posterior portions of superior and middle
temporal gyri (pSTG/MTG). PSTG/MTG, together with amygdala
input, extract and integrate acoustic features that have emotional
salience, which are subsequently evaluated for goal relevance in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). We developed an event-related fMRI prosody
identification paradigm (four emotions: happiness fear, anger or no emotion), parametrically varying the presence of salient acoustic cues that
typify particular emotions. Using this paradigm in 28 healthy individu-

123

Poster Session D — Sunday, April 3, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
als, we previously described this temporo-frontal circuit in its most basic
form, and observed that auditory regions along with amygdala activated
reciprocally with IFG as a function of affective cue salience and correlated identification accuracy. However, our analysis indicated that parametric changes in cue saliency also modulated activity in cingulate,
caudate, nucleus accumbens (NA), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(vmPFC), suggesting a need for more complex and comprehensive models. Here we employed graph theory (Sporns and Rubinov, NeuroImage
2009) to characterize the functional configuration of this network and
how this configuration changes as cue-based signal ambiguity leads to
emotion identification ambiguity. We characterized the efficiency and
modularity of the overall network, and the degree and betweenness-centrality of individual nodes (regions). Preliminary results indicate that
during correctly-identified high cue salience stimuli (vs. incorrectlyidentified low cue salience stimuli), overall network integration and connectivity of NA and vmPFC was higher, while the connectivity between
cingulate and IFG was reduced.

DIFFERENTIAL NEURAL ACTIVITY DURING EMOTIONAL VS. NONEMOTIONAL REVERSAL LEARNING Kaoru Nashiro1, Lin Nga1, Mara
Mather1; 1University of Southern California — Reversal

learning refers to the
ability to change an established pattern of behavior based on feedback.
In a typical reversal learning experiment, one learns a stimulus-reward
association (e.g., selecting a particular object yields a monetary reward)
and when the association changes, one needs to alter their response. The
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been identified as a critical region for
reversal learning. However, little is known about how the emotional
salience of outcomes affects brain activity during reversal learning. The
current study examined whether emotional vs. non-emotional outcomes
would activate different regions of the brain during reversal learning. To
test this, on each trial we asked participants to select which of two neutral faces would change. In some blocks, the change was emotional; one
of the faces would smile or frown if selected, whereas the other face
would not change. In other blocks, the change was not emotional; one of
the faces would appear with eyeglasses if selected, whereas the other
face would not change. We contrasted activity during the decision-making phase of trials immediately after reversals in the emotion vs. nonemotion blocks - when participants viewed two neutral faces whose
associated outcomes had just switched. Thus, there were no perceptual
differences between the conditions for this contrast. However, several
brain regions including the OFC showed greater activity after emotional
than after non-emotional reversals. The results indicate that the brain
processes emotional reversals differently than non-emotional reversals.

words in adult patients with unilateral amygdala damage (n=26) and
demographically matched healthy controls (n=30). In contrast to healthy
controls, patients with amygdala lesions did not show emotional Stroop
interference from negative words. However, negative Stroop effect magnitude was unrelated to amygdala volume loss in patients. All groups
exhibited an intact color Stroop effect. These results suggest that
although patients with unilateral amygdala damage may be less distracted by negative emotional words, this effect may be due to extraamygdalar temporal lobe damage.

studies suggest that actions performed by body parts or effectors (e.g.,
robotic claws) that we do not have activate sensorimotor regions, such as
in the premotor and parietal nodes of the mirror neuron system. However, in many cases, the effector of interest is visually familiar, even if the
observer does not possess that body part (e.g., a hand observed by an
individual without hands). In this study, we examined the neural
response to a visually novel biological effector (an amputated limb) and
a familiar biological effector (a hand), during both the initial viewing of
each as well as after prolonged visual exposure. Using fMRI, we first
scanned typically-developed participants with little to no prior experience with amputatees as they watched short video clips of identical
actions performed by an amputated upper extremity and a hand. We
then showed extended clips of each effector to provide increased visual
experience with each effector, and rescanned participants. Our preliminary results reveal a greater sensorimotor response to the novel effector
compared to the familiar effector during the initial viewing of the
actions, but similar responses to both effectors after visual exposure. We
suggest that these results provide new information on the role of experience in understanding and representing novel effectors in the brain and
hold implications for how different types of experiences may affect the
way that we represent others’ actions.

Vanderbilt University, 2Trinity College Dublin, 3University of Winnipeg — Pre-

vious work has shown that task-irrelevant affective stimulus qualities
can facilitate or interfere with attention depending on variables such as
stimulus type and timing. The predominant model for emotion-facilitated attention holds that the amygdala modulates sensory cortices to
bias processing in favor of emotional stimuli. Although one highly influential study found that patients with left amygdala damage failed to
show enhanced identification of emotional words in an attentional blink
task (Anderson & Phelps, Nature, 2001), recent studies from our lab and
others have found no evidence for emotion-facilitated detection of
threat-relevant stimuli in patients with unilateral (Piech et al., Neuropsychologia, 2010) or bilateral amygdala lesions (Tsuchiya et al., Nature
Neuroscience, 2009). Because these studies examined only task conditions in which emotion facilitated attention, it remains unclear whether
the amygdala is necessary for cases in which emotion interferes with
attention. We therefore investigated whether unilateral amygdala lesions
attenuate affective distraction using a Stroop task variant. We measured
the latency to name word color for negative, positive, neutral and color

HEMISPHERIC BLOOD FLOW DURING EMOTIONAL PROCESSING: A
TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER STUDY Daniel Horton1, Natalie Ceballos1,
Reiko Graham1; 1Department of Psychology, Texas State University — Transc-

ranial Doppler (TCD) is a noninvasive and portable method of assessing
changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the basal cerebral
arteries. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of TCD in
examining changes in CBFV in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) in
response to viewing emotional pictures. MCA CBFV was monitored
bilaterally in 23 normotensive adults (17 female, 6 male; aged 20-31
years, M=23.3 years) during a blocked viewing task (positive, negative,
neutral – 30 images in each block, each presented for 2 seconds), alternating with 2 minute rest periods. Results revealed that mean and peak
CBFV were faster in the left hemisphere during picture viewing, and that
the CBFV changes in the MCA in response to viewing pictures were
larger in men relative to women. Significant heart rate deceleration was
also observed during picture viewing relative to baseline periods. Resistance (estimated with Pourcelot’s index) was moderated by emotional
pictures and also varied as a function of hemisphere. Specifically, while
viewing all picture types resulted in decreases in MCA resistivity in the
right hemisphere, decreases in resistivity in the left hemisphere were
only observed for positive pictures. Given that CBFV did not change and
that heart rate deceleration was consistent across all conditions, we speculate that resistivity decreases were due to higher diastolic flow. These
results are consistent with models of emotional processing, which postulate a general role for the right hemisphere in processing emotions, and
left hemisphere involvement in processing positive emotional content.

neutral face, fearful face)× 2 (relationships between cues and targets:

probability that the priming words were inconsistent with the target
words was 75%. Behavioral results revealed that in the 50% conditions,
the reaction time of fearful faces in the consistent trails is shorter than
that of the inconsistent ones. The reaction time of neutral faces in the

was more affected by the bottom-up processing, while neutral faces were
more affected by the top-down processing.

PROCESSING OF CIGARETTE AND FOOD STIMULI IN INSULA FOR
CIGARETTE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKING CONTROLS Richard Lopez1,

Hedy Kober2, Peter Mende-Siedlecki3, Ethan Kross4, Walter Mischel1, Carl
Hart1, Kevin Ochsner1; 1Columbia University, 2Yale University, 3Princeton
University, 4University of Michigan — It has been suggested that the insula

plays a significant role in craving for cigarettes. For example, insula
damage is associated with reduced craving and increased quitting. However, other lines of research also have implicated the insula in processing
the somatosensory aspects of tasting food stimuli rather than in food
craving. We scanned twenty-one cigarette smokers using Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) as they viewed photographs of cigarettes and tasty foods. Participants were instructed to focus on the
immediate sensory experience of food and cigarettes (“NOW” strategy),
or on the long-term health consequences associated with them
(“LATER” strategy). Participants reported significantly greater craving
in the NOW compared to LATER condition for both food and cigarettes.
While separate subsections of insula showed significantly greater activation for food vs. cigarette stimuli, there was no difference in insula activity for NOW vs. LATER trials, and insula activity did not correlate with
craving for either stimulus. Instead, activity in bilateral insula positively
correlated with number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), such that
those who reported greater CPD showed greater activation for food
compared to cigarettes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis
that the insula plays a significant role in the processing somatosensory
aspects of both cigarette and gustatory stimuli, above and beyond the
experience of craving.

ALE META-ANALYSIS REVEALS SEX DIFFERENCES IN THE NEURAL
CORRELATES OF EMOTION PROCESSING IN THE AMYGDALA AND
RELATED REGIONS Jennifer Strafford Wilson1, Stephan Hamann1; 1Emory
University — A small number of functional neuroimaging studies have
examined sex differences in emotional neural processing, making it difficult to characterize patterns of sex differences without combining findings quantitatively across studies. Here we used quantitative metaanalysis to combine data from the largest set of neuroimaging studies
examined to date, supplementing the small number of studies directly
examining sex differences in emotion with the much larger set of studies
that have examined men only, or women only. We used activation likelihood estimation (ALE 2.0) to combine peak activation coordinates from
studies that contrasted emotion elicitation with a neutral or baseline condition (45 studies of women; 44 of men). Sex differences in emotional
responses were examined separately for positive and negative emotions,
and in a combined analysis of all emotions regardless of valence. For
negative emotion, women showed greater activation likelihood than
men in left amygdala whereas men showed greater activation likelihood

125

in right amygdala. Additional regions preferentially activated during
negative emotion in women included left thalamus, mammillary bodies,
left caudate, and medial prefrontal cortex. For positive emotion, men
showed greater activation likelihood than women in left amygdala. Men
preferentially activated bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, left insula, left
posterior cingulate, and right fusiform. Results indicate that sex differences can be consistently observed in the amygdala and other areas
closely associated with emotion processing. Our findings demonstrate
that sex differences in the context of positive vs. negative emotion differ
substantially, and parallel previously reported sex differences in emotional responsivity and vulnerability to affective disorders.

DECONSTRUCTING EMOTION EXPERIENCE: NEURAL EVIDENCE FOR
CORE AFFECT Christine Wilson-Mendenhall1,2, Lisa Barrett2,3, Lawrence
Barsalou1; 1Emory University, 2Northeastern University, 3Massachussetts
General Hospital, Harvard Medical School — Basic emotion theories propose

that non-reducible affect programs in the brain produce a small number
of discrete emotions such as fear or happiness. An alternative view is
that core affect is a basic ingredient of emotion experience, and that neural systems underlie core affect properties of valence and arousal. To test
the core affect hypothesis, we developed fear, happiness, and sadness
scenarios that varied in valence and arousal. During an fMRI session,
participants imagined these scenarios from a first-person perspective,
and then focused on and rated the valence or arousal of the induced
emotion. The core affect view predicts that the brain regions correlating
with valence or arousal ratings should be the same across experiences of
all three emotions. Based on previous literature, we predicted that
valence ratings would correlate with activity in orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) and that arousal ratings would correlate with activity in the
amygdala. As predicted, across all three emotion categories, activity in
medial OFC increased as rated unpleasantness decreased and rated
pleasantness increased, whereas activity in left amygdala increased as
rated arousal increased. Interestingly, a gradient in medial OFC was also
observed in which voxels most sensitive to unpleasantness were more
inferior to those most sensitive to pleasantness. The findings support the
view that valence and arousal are basic properties of core affect that contribute to emotional experience.

AMYGDALA ACTIVATION IS LINKED TO PATTERNS OF EMOTIONAL
DECISION MAKING IN PSYCHOPATHY Abigail Marsh1, Elise Cardinale1,
Caitlin Taylor1; 1Georgetown University — Psychopathy is a personality vari-

able associated with antisocial behavior and deficient empathy and
remorse. Prior research demonstrates that psychopathy is also associated
with deficits in recognizing and responding to distress cues such as fearful facial expressions. This impairment has been linked to deficits in
amygdala function and may be associated with prevalent antisocial
behavior in psychopathy. Theories of psychopathy specify that
amygdala dysfunction may prevent psychopathic individuals from making appropriate decisions about behaviors that cause others fear or distress. The present study demonstrates that, relative to controls, highly
psychopathic individuals judge behaviors that cause others fear to be
more acceptable, and that this response pattern is associated with
reduced amygdala activation in highly psychopathic subjects. A community sample of 19 participants underwent fMRI scanning while viewing
statements that elicit various emotions (e.g., anger, disgust, fear). Participants decided whether making each statement to another person would
ever be appropriate and indicated their decisions using button presses.
As has been previously demonstrated, higher psychopathy scores were
associated with judgments that frightening others is more acceptable.
FMRI data indicated that this response pattern is associated with
reduced amygdala activation when psychopathic subjects judged frightening statements. Differential patterns of amygdala activation were not
associated with judgments of other types of emotional statements. This
study links fear processing deficits in psychopathy to judgments about
antisocial behavior. These data are the first to show that amygdala dys-

126

function in psychopathy is associated with judgments about the acceptability of causing others fear.

IS THE FRUSTRATION EFFECT FRUSTRATING? A TASK TO LOCALIZE
REGIONS INVOLVED IN FRUSTRATION Steven
Green1,
Sharlene

Newman1; 1Indiana University — According to Abram Amsel, frustration is

experienced when an expected reward is omitted. He further states that
when frustrated, responding becomes more vigorous; which he calls the
frustration effect. Thus, the frustration effect provides a behavioral measure for frustration which could be used to identify the neural network
that underlies frustration. However, no studies have confirmed that the
subjective experience of frustration corresponds to the frustration effect
in humans. The current study tested a task that may be used as a functional localizer that elicits the frustration effect. Here subject’s self
reports of frustration were compared with the behavioral frustration
effect in order to verify the connection. To manipulate frustration levels,
the outcomes of reward and reward omission were occasionally
repeated either twice or three times. The frustration effect was demonstrated in the significant difference in reaction time between reward
omission and reward trials. However, the repetition of outcome did not
interact with the frustration effect. There was a significant effect of outcome on self reports of frustration. Reward omission trials were reported
as being more frustrating than non reward trials. In contrast to the frustration effect, there was a significant effect of outcome repetition on
reports of frustration. Subjects reported higher levels of frustration when
reward omission trials were repeated and decreasing levels of frustration when reward trials were repeated. These results suggest the task
may be used broadly to localize regions associated with frustration.

DOPAMINE RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH
PERSONALITY TRAITS RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL DISINHIBITION Sang-

hyun Baik1, Su Jin Kim2, Hyeon Min An1, Sang Eun Kim2, Sang Hee Kim1;
1
Korea University, 2Department of Nucear Medicine, Seoul National University
Bundang Hospital — Behavioral disinhibition has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders such as substance abuse disorders.
Recent neuroimaging and genetic studies have suggested that dopaminergic activity in the brain plays an important role in individual differences in personality traits characterized by behavioral disinhibition such
as impulsivity, novelty seeking and extraversion. We designed positron
emission tomography (PET) study to investigate the contribution of
dopaminergic receptor availability in personalty traits related to behavioral disinhibition. Seventeen healthy, right-handed volunteers (10 men
and 7 women, mean age 24.24±2.68 years) participated in the study. T1weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) and [18F]fallypride PET
data were acquired from each participant and questionnaires measuring
related personality characteristics were completed. PET images were
spatially realigned to correct motion, and coregistered to individual
MRIs using SPM 5 and PMOD 3.13. Regions of interest included the
bilateral ventral striatum, caudate nucleus, and putamen. We found a
positive correlation between extraversion scores and the BP values of the
right caudate nucleus and left putamen. Significant negative correlations
between the imlsivity scores on Eysenk questionnaires and the BP values
of the right cigulate was observed {p<0.005(unc.), and extend threshold
k=10 voxels}. In this study we found that dopamine receptor availability
in the striatum was associated with individual differences in impulsiveness and extraversion. Given that behavioral disinhibition has been consistently reported in neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, our
results contribute to the understanding of neurochemical mechanisms of
such disorders.

conditioned facial stimuli. We examined the neural processing of fearconditioned stimulus using a classical fear conditioning procedure with
event-related potentials (ERPs). Twenty-one healthy college students (5
men and 16 women; age range = 20-24 years) participated in the experiment. The stimuli consisted of four pictures of two female faces (angry
and neutral). During the conditioning session, one angry face of the two
female faces (conditioned stimulus: CS+) was paired with a mild electric
shock (unconditioned stimulus: US) on fingers, and the other angry face
was unpaired (CS-). In a subsequent emotional Stroop task, the participants were tasked to identify the color of the facial stimuli (red, green,
blue, or yellow). Early posterior negativity (EPN) was significantly
greater in the conditioned face and the neutral face of the same visage
(CS+ type) over temporo-occipital sites. Late positive potential (LPP)
also significantly increased with the angry faces (emotion type) over centro-parietal sites. The level of state-anxiety was positively correlated
with attentional bias score and the mean amplitude of the CS+ type of
LPP component. These findings provide stimulus type (CS+ type and
emotion type) - specific components in ERPs for attentional bias to conditioned emotional face stimuli and demonstrate a correlation between
anxiety and acquired attentional bias.

DIFFERING NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH RATING VALENCE VS.
AROUSAL WHILE VIEWING EMOTIONAL IMAGES Joseph Andreano1,2,

Rebecca Dautoff1,2, Brad Dickerson1,2, Christopher Wright1, Lisa Feldman
Barrett1,2,3; 1Massachusetts General Hospital, 2Athinoula A. Martinos Center
for Biomedical Imaging, 3Northeastern University — In prevailing models,

emotion is generally divided into two separate measures of valence and
arousal, and neuroimaging studies of emotion typically use subjective
emotional ratings based on one of these two measures. As valence and
arousal are believed to be psychologically distinct, rating either of these
features likely involves intentionally shifting attention to focus on one or
the other aspect of emotional experience. The process of subjective rating, therefore, may involve a form of top-down modulation of the brain’s
affective circuitry. To address this question, 34 participants between the
ages of 60 and 86 were scanned by fMRI while viewing a sequence of
International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images selected to vary by
both valence and arousal. During viewing, 22 participants provided an
arousal rating for each image, while 17 participants rated valence.
Whole-brain analysis was then used to identify the networks associated
with rating either valence or arousal. Additionally, the timecourse of the
BOLD response to IAPS images was compared between valence and
arousal raters in several affective ROIs, including amygdala, anterior
cingulate, and insula. The results indicated differences in valence and
arousal rating networks, with several frontal and temporal regions of
activation unique to the arousal rating group. Significant differences in
the response of affective ROIs were also detected. These findings suggest
that the neural response to emotion differs depending upon the aspect of
emotion that is emphasized.

DYNAMIC CROSS-MODAL PRIMING OF EMOTION INVESTIGATED WITH

EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS Patricia
Paulmann2, Marc D. Pell3, Sonja A. Kotz1; 1Max Planck Institute for Human
Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany, 2University of Essex,
Colchester, UK, 3McGill University, Montreal, Canada — Emotional expres-

sions from face and voice are inherently dynamic. However, the processing of emotional facial expressions is often tested with static images.
Also, we do not know much about how these two communication channels interact. In the present study, we set out to investigate how dynamic
facial expressions influence the processing of emotional speech and vice
versa in a priming paradigm. We used videos of four actors interpreting
emotional sentences, cut to 520 ms length and without sound. Voice
stimuli were sentences in pseudo-speech, unintelligible to listeners, but
conveying different emotional tones, with a duration of approximately 3
seconds. Event-related potential responses were recorded from 64 scalp

electrodes. Thirty-two participants were presented with angry, happy or
emotionally-neutral stimuli as primes, immediately followed by an
angry or happy target. Thus, there was a congruent, an incongruent, and
a neutral prime condition. A gender decision was performed to keep
subjects unaware of study purposes. For the video-as-prime condition,
we observed a congruency effect as early as 100 ms post sentence-onset,
with an enhanced N100 in response to incongruent trials. Furthermore,
incongruency elicited an N400-like component. In the speech-as-prime
condition, incongruency effects emerged later, in an enhanced negativity
for congruent trials peaking approximately 200 ms after target onset.
These data suggest that dynamic audiovisual emotional priming works
in both priming directions and under implicit processing conditions.
Due to different prime durations, depending on whether a video or a
sentence served as prime, different processing steps may have been
tapped by prime-target congruency manipulations.

IMPLICIT EFFECTS OF EMOTIONAL PROSODY ON VISUAL BEHAVIOR
Simon Rigoulot1, Marc Pell1; 1McGill University — During a conversation, lis-

teners encounter linguistic and extra-linguistic information that can
guide visual behavior, including vocal cues about a speaker’s emotion
(emotional prosody). Here, we investigated whether the implicit processing of emotional prosody influences gaze behavior to facial expressions of emotion in a visual search task. Thirty-one participants viewed
five-second visual arrays composed of four faces portraying happiness,
anger, fear and neutrality, while concurrently listening to a pseudoutterance (Someone migged the pazing) uttered with a happy, angry,
fearful or neutral prosody played during the first 1250 millisecond of the
array. We recorded the eye movements of the participants as they
scanned the visual array and analyzed the frequency and duration of
first saccades and of total looks in three temporal windows ([0-1250 ms],
[1250-2500 ms], [2500-5000 ms]) according to the emotional content of
faces and voices. We observed that participants looked more frequently
and longer at faces that matched the prosody, and that this effect persisted after the auditory information was no longer present (i.e., in the
1250-2500 time window). As well, the specific emotional content of the
voice influenced the congruency effect, which was more prominent in
response to fearful and happy voices than to the other emotions. These
data confirm the importance of emotional auditory information which
guides visual scanning behavior to facial cues during social communication, in an automatic and emotion-congruent manner even after the
auditory stimulus has been processed.

E13
DIFFERENTIAL ACTIVATION OF THE CALCARINE FISSURE AND FUSIFORM
GYRUS BY EMOTION OF VIEWED FACES Kaitlyn DePlonty1, Per Lynse1,2,

Pilar Sanjuan1,2, Robert Thoma1, Jeffrey Lewine1; 1Mind Research Network,
2
University of New Mexico — The ability to recognize facial expressions is
critical to social interactions between humans. Behavioral studies demonstrate impairments in face processing in several conditions characterized by abnormal socialization. In trying to elucidate the neurobiology of
face processing, most models and neuroimaging studies have focused on
the role of brain regions beyond core visual cortex; the fusiform face
region and the amygdala. Of particular interest has been the right fusiform cortex, with multiple types of imaging studies providing converging data that the activity of this region is modulated by the specific
emotional characteristics of faces. Using MEG, Lewis et al. (2003) found
differential activation of the right fusiform when viewing happy, versus
disgusted versus neutral versus swirled faces. The current work sought
to extend these findings by, 1) expanding the stimulus set to all six basic
emotions and an additional non-face control condition, 2) investigating
the primary visual response of the calcarine fissure for an emotiondependent component, and 3) investigating effects of subject gender and
age. As expected, the latency and peak-amplitude of activity in the fusiform was modulated by emotional characteristics of faces. However, our
data also showed a very early, and different pattern of emotion-related
modulation of responses from the calcarine cortex. In the calcarine,

127

Poster Session E — Monday, April 4, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse
happy faces were seen to elicit the greatest amplitude of response,
whereas, in the fusiform, fearful and surprised faces resulted in the largest responses. Additional results were a main effect for gender, with
women displaying greater amplitude, and an effect of age towards
greater amplitude.

THE EYE MOVEMENT PATTERNS IN VIEWING CHINESE AFFECTIVE
PICTURES Tsung-Han Yang1, Nai-Shing Yen1,2, Yuan-Yi Chang1, Pei-Chi

Tseng1, Chieh-Ning Lee1, Ching-Hui Chueh1; 1Department of Psychology,
National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan, 2Research Center for Mind, Brain,
and Learning, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan — Pictures from
the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS, Lang, Bradley, &
Cuthbert, 2005) are usually used to elicit different emotion responses.
But the results of using IAPS in Taiwan showed some cultural differences. A Chinese-IAPS has been developed and the subjective ratings of
Taiwanese were collected. It was found that the erotic pictures were
rated as neutral stimuli, which is different from the results of IAPS. For
understanding how Taiwanese attend to the affective pictures, we used
eye-tracker to record the fixation numbers and gaze durations in the
emotional area of the pictures from 9 Taiwanese. Ninety-six pictures
were selected from Chinese-IAPS and assigned evenly into positive
(mean=7.84), neutral (mean=5.05), and negative (mean=2.06) categories,
and the erotic pictures were in the neutral category. In number of fixations, there was no significant difference between 3 categories. However,
the gaze duration of positive pictures were significantly longer than
those of neutral and negative pictures. The 96 pictures were further
divided into 5 subcategories: positive, erotic, other neutral, mutilation,
and other negative. The gaze duration of the erotic pictures was significantly shorter than those of other categories. In number of fixations,
although there was no significant difference between the subcategories,
the fixation numbers of erotic pictures were the highest. The results suggested that when Taiwanese saw these erotic pictures, although the emotional area attracted attention many times, but every gaze time was
short. This is consistent with the social expectation in Taiwan that the
erotic material are often associated with impoliteness and shame.

FEAR CONDITIONING WITHOUT AWARENESS USING CONTINUOUS
FLASH SUPPRESSION Candace Raio1, David Carmel1, Marisa Carrasco1,
Elizabeth Phelps1; 1New York University — Learning what to fear is essential

for adaptive functioning. While threatening stimuli can be detected—
and the fear they elicit physiologically expressed—outside of awareness,
it remains unclear whether new fear associations can be learned without
awareness. Here, we investigated this issue using a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm while suppressing long-duration conditioned stimuli
(CSs) from awareness using continuous flash suppression (CFS). During
CFS, stimuli presented to one eye are rendered invisible by salient
dynamic stimulation of the other eye. One suppressed stimulus (CS+)
was occasionally paired with a shock, whereas the other (CS-) was not.
Importantly, the temporal parameters of CFS allowed for the measurement of participants’ fear–evoked skin conductance responses (SCRs)
during acquisition, rather than the expression of fear afterwards. Two
groups of participants were conditioned with identical CSs, either with
CFS (unaware group) or without it (aware group). We found significantly greater responding to the CS+ in both groups, but the temporal
pattern of this learning differed. Robust differential SCRs were observed
only during early acquisition (1st half of session) for unaware participants, and only during late acquisition (2nd half of session) for aware
participants. Conditioning magnitude was negatively correlated with
state anxiety in both groups, but only during the stage in which differential learning occurred. Our data suggest that fear conditioning without
awareness recruits a rapid, automatic form of learning that also dissipates swiftly, perhaps because it is preserved for identifying immediate
threats, while fear conditioning with awareness may employ cognitive
mechanisms that allow associations to develop over time.

GENETIC MODULATION OF EXTINCTION RETENTION, ANXIETY, AND
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN HUMANS Catherine Hartley1, Elizabeth

Phelps1, B.J. Casey2, Charles Glatt2; 1New York University, 2Weill Cornell
Medical College — Serotonin has long been implicated in the etiology of

depression and anxiety, however there is no clear mechanistic account of
its function in these disorders. A recent report (Wellman et al., 2007) that
serotonin transporter (5-HTT) knockout mice show heightened spontaneous fear recovery following extinction, as well as anxiety and depression-like behavior suggests that serotonin may contribute to anxiety and
depression by modulating extinction retention. Genetic variation in 5HTT expression may function similarly in humans. Here, we explored
whether two 5-HTT gene polymorphisms, 5-HTTLPR and a serotonin
transporter polyadenylation polymorphism (STPP/rs3813034), were
associated with extinction retention and self-reported anxiety and
depressive symptoms. Subjects took part in a two-day fear conditioning
paradigm consisting of acquisition and extinction, followed 24 hours
later by a test of extinction retention. Participants’ degree of extinction
retention and self-reported anxiety were inversely correlated. Furthermore, STPP genotype had a dose-dependent association with spontaneous fear recovery, while 5-HTTLPR had none. Trait anxiety and
depressive symptoms were strongly associated with STPP genotype, and
weakly associated with 5-HTTLPR genotype. However, participants’
number of low-expressing STPP and 5-HTTLPR alleles were correlated
within our sample, and path analysis demonstrates that the apparent
association of 5-HTTLPR with both measures is entirely explained by its
correlation with STPP. These data suggest that the little-studied STPP
may be an important risk factor for depression and anxiety, and that the
controversial inconsistent 5-HTTLPR associations with these phenotypes
may be due to variable correlation with STPP in experimental samples.

Todd Parrish1, Tetsuya Iidaka3, Joan Chiao1; 1Northwestern University, 2Duke
University, 3Nagoya University, 4Tohoku University, 5National Institute for
Physiological Sciences — Mood and anxiety disorders have been linked to

a number of biological mechanisms, including variations in the serotonin
transporter gene, increased amygdala response to emotional stimuli, and
decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and regulatory
prefrontal cortex regions (Pezawas et al., 2005). Most of this work, however, focuses mainly on outcomes in Western, individualistic contexts,
and treats heightened emotional sensitivity as maladaptive. One theory
holds that living according to collectivistic norms requires particular
sensitivity to negative information in one’s surroundings, due to
increased emphasis on group membership and hierarchy (Chiao & Blizinsky, 2010). Here we examine the neural mechanisms by which cultural
values specifically influence emotional response and regulation. Bicultural Asian Americans completed an individualistic or collectivistic
essay prime, and subsequently matched a series of emotional scenes and
geometric shapes during fMRI scanning. Measures of effective connectivity between right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) and bilateral
amygdala--estimated by dynamic causal modeling— differed between
the collectivistic and individualistic prime groups, such that collectivists
showed greater top-down LOFC influence on amygdala response.
Behavioral results further indicate that collectivistic priming increased
task accuracy without a reaction time tradeoff. Taken together, these
findings demonstrate that even temporarily heightening awareness of
collectivistic cultural values enhances emotional vigilance. These neural
and behavioral findings highlight the importance of considering cultural
context in neurobiological models of psychopathology.

Yamaguchi1,2; 1Rhythm-based Brain Computation Unit, RIKEN BSI-TOYOTA
Collaboration Center, Japan, 2Laboratory for Dynamics of Emergent
Intelligence, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan — Our daily behaviors are
often affected by the subjective preferences. Previous studies have
shown that the unconscious physical responses would surface prior to
the conscious decision making for subjective preference. If so, it might be
hypothesized that the neural activity for visual attention is influenced by
the subjective preferences. However, there are little neurological findings about the relationships between visual attention and subjective
preferences. Here, to address the issue, we have focused on the laterality
for the visual attention and investigated the effects of the subjective preferences on the neural activities. We measured the electroencephalogram
(EEG) during a preference judgment task which required 19 participants
to choice a preferred one from two simultaneously right and left presented colors. In addition, to indentify the oscillatory activity for visual
attention, we conducted a control condition where subjects were asked
to merely attend either right or left color. EEG results showed that theta
(4-6Hz) activity was enhanced in the right and left occipital electrodes
during attending color in the opposite hemi-field. The contralateral
occipital theta activity was also increased to the direction that the preferred color was presented. The duration of the activity was longer than
that of the ipsilateral occipital activity. These results indicated that the
attention-related brain activity would be affected by the subjective preference. Moreover, the frontal beta activity for the preferred color was
increased rather that for the attended color, suggesting that the activity is
associated with the subjective preference itself.

Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Integrated Neuroimaging, The

(AMNCH), & St. James’s Hospital, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland — Major
depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with alterations in brain function that might be useful for therapy evaluation. The current study
aimed to identify predictors for therapy improvement and to track functional brain changes during therapy. Twenty-one drug-free patients with
MDD underwent functional MRI twice during performance of an emotional perception task: once before and once after 4 weeks of antidepressant treatment (mirtazapine or venlafaxine). Twelve healthy controls
were investigated once with the same methods. A significant difference
between groups was a relative greater activation of the right dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex in the patients vs. controls. Before treatment, patients
responding better to pharmacological treatment showed greater activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during viewing of negative
emotional pictures. Activations in the caudate nucleus, subgenual anterior cingulated cortex (sgACC) and insula decreased after successful
treatment. The distinction in brain activity between responders and nonresponders might be related to altered self-referential processes and a
differential response to external emotional stimuli, suggesting differences in the processing of emotionally salient stimuli between those who
are likely to respond to pharmacological treatment and those who will
not. In accordance with previous studies, the present investigation suggests the insula, caudate nucleus and sgACC may have a key role as a
biological marker for treatment response and predictor for therapeutic
success.

DURING REWARD PROCESSING VENTRAL STRIATAL AND MEDIAL
PREFRONTAL FMRI ACTIVATION IS CORRELATED WITH THE FEEDBACK
NEGATIVITY ERP Josh Carlson1, Dan Foti1, Lilianne Mujica-Parodi1, Eddie

Harmon-Jones2, Greg Hajcak1; 1Stony Brook University, 2Texas A&M
University — Localization research utilizing functional magnetic reso-

nance imaging (fMRI) suggests that the ventral striatum (VS), medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and other structures of the mesocorticolimbic
dopamine system underlie aspects of reward processing from expectation and craving of reward to the pleasurable states experienced upon
reward attainment. At the same time, research assessing the temporal
characteristics of reward processing with event-related potentials (ERP)
indicates that the feedback negativity (FN) is sensitive to reward vs. nonreward feedback and outcome expectation. Source localization techniques indentify the mPFC and VS as likely neural generators of the FN.
Yet, to the best of our knowledge, research has not directly explored the
relationship between ERP and fMRI measures of reward processing
within the same sample. Given the complementary strengths and weaknesses of ERP and fMRI, collecting both measures in a single sample can
provide unique insight into the neural processing of reward. Therefore,
our primary aim was to assess the relationship between fMRI (i.e., VS
and mPFC) and ERP (i.e., FN) measures of reward processing. Counterbalanced fMRI and ERP sessions of a monetary gambling task were completed by 45 individuals. We found a positive correlation between fMRI
activation in the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit including the VS and
mPFC and the FN for the Win > Loss comparison. In sum, we provide
evidence that monetary gains activate the VS, mPFC, amygdala, and
orbital frontal cortex, amplify the FN ERP component at approximately
300ms post feedback, and that these fMRI and ERP measures of reward
processing are related.

INSULA REACTIVITY TRACES CONDITIONED FEAR GRADIENTS WITH
RESPECT TO THREAT-SALIENCE Tsafrir Greenberg1, Joshua M. Carlson1,

Greg Hajcak1, Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi1; 1Stony Brook University — Fear generalization is the transfer of conditioned fear to perceptually similar
stimuli. This process is thought to contribute to the maintenance of anxiety symptoms by extending a learned fear response to potentially innocuous cues. Recent studies have demonstrated that fear-potentiated
startle and skin conductance responses to a conditioned stimulus (CS)
generalize to similar stimuli, with the strength of fear generalization
linked to perceptual similarity with the CS. The aim of the present study
was to extend this work by examining whether neural reactivity shows a
similar response pattern to that reported with peripheral measures of
fear. An initial study (N=8) revealed that insula reactivity tracks the conditioned fear gradient. Here, we attempt to validate this effect in an independent sample (N=8) using a fear generalization task optimized for
functional neuroimaging. The CS was a medium sized rectangle and coterminated with an electric shock 50% of the time. Six rectangles differing by ±20%, ±40% or ±60% in width from the CS served as the generalization stimuli. Parameter estimates extracted from a 10×10×10 mm cube
surrounding the maximum activated voxel in the left and right insula
(for each stimulus versus baseline contrast), showed a significant quadratic trend with highest reactivity to the CS and decreased response
amplitude with increasing perceptual dissimilarity. This response pattern was consistent with participants’ post-task ratings of perceived
shock likelihood for each of the rectangles. These findings provide a first
step in elucidating the neurocircuitry of an important learning mechanism that may contribute to increased anxiety in patients.

EMOTIONS AFFECT MOTOR RESPONSES AND THE NEURAL
PROCESSES Jie Yu1, Jin Yan1; 1The Chinese University of Hong Kong —
Human emotions affect judgments and responses. The purpose of this
study was to examine the impacts of three emotional states (positive,
neutral, or negative) on the speed and accuracy of a conflict motor task.

The neural mechanisms of the emotional effects in motor judgments
were also explored. After viewing an emotional picture of a sport event,
each participant performed the Simon task while reaction time (RT),
response accuracy (RA), and event-related potentials (ERPs) were
recorded. Behavioral findings indicate that the emotional states resulted
in significant differences in RT, but not in RA. Delta RT analyses suggest
that subjects performed better in conflict control under positive conditions than under neutral and negative conditions. ERPs results showed
marked emotion-related gaps in P1, N1, P2, and N2 in selected brain
regions. In frontal and left occipital regions, negative emotions produced
shorter P1 peak latencies than positive and neutral stimuli. Positive stimuli activated P1 and resulted in shorter N2 latencies while triggering
higher N2 activation levels in left hemisphere. Negative stimuli, however, caused shorter N2 latencies and higher N2 activation levels in right
hemisphere. Overall, positive stimuli generated longer N1 and P2 latencies and higher N1 and P2 activation levels in frontal and occipital lobes
than neutral and negative stimuli. The results support the broaden-andbuild hypothesis that positive emotions facilitate conflict control by
expanding the scope of attention and the thought-actions repertory.

OVERNIGHT THERAPY? SLEEP DE-POTENTIATES EMOTIONAL BRAIN
REACTIVITY Els van der Helm1, Justin Yao1, Vikram Rao1, Shubir Dutt1,

Matthew Walker1; 1University of California Berkeley — While the benefit of
sleep on various neurocognitive processes has been established, a role
for sleep in emotional brain regulation remains largely uncharacterized.
This is surprising considering that nearly all clinical mood disorders
express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, most commonly in the
amount and timing of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Using fMRI in
combination with EEG sleep physiology, here we test the hypothesis that
sleep, and specific aspects of REM sleep, de-potentiates the behavioral
and neural reactivity associated with prior affective experiences. Thirtythree healthy young adults performed two fMRI sessions, separated by a
12hr period containing either a full night of physiologically recorded
sleep (Sleep-group), or a normal waking day (Wake-group). At each session, participants rated affective picture-stimuli on a 1-5 scale (corresponding to increasing emotional intensity). In contrast to equivalent
time awake, sleep resulted in a selective and significant palliative overnight reduction in extreme emotion intensity ratings (P?0.04). This
behavioral de-potentiation was further associated with an interaction
effect in the amygdala, showing overnight decreases in reactivity in the
Sleep-group (P=0.004), while no such decrease was observed in the
Wake-group. Additionally, this sleep-dependent reduction in amygdala
reactivity was associated with enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(vmPFC) functional connectivity (P=0.005). Moreover, the overnight
increase in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity correlated significantly with
the speed of entry into REM sleep (R=0.53, P=0.025). Taken together,
these findings support a homeostatic role for sleep, and especially REM
sleep, in the optimal regulation of limbic brain networks, de-potentiating
next-day emotional reactivity and re-establishing vmPFC top-down control.

THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF EMPATHY: EXPERIENCE, AUTOMATICITY,
AND PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR Sylvia A. Morelli1, Lian T. Rameson1, Matthew

D. Lieberman1; 1University of California, Los Angeles — Empathy is a critical

aspect of human emotional experience that influences the behavior of
individuals as well as the functioning of society as a whole. Although
empathy is first and foremost a subjective experience, no studies have
yet examined the neural correlates of the self-reported experience of
empathy. Furthermore, although interest in empathy can be traced to its
role in promoting prosocial behavior, no work has yet linked empathyrelated neural activity to real-world behavior. Lastly, the assumption
that empathy is an automatic experience remains a largely untested supposition. It is also unknown whether individual differences in trait
empathy reflect either variability in the automaticity of empathic
responses or the capacity to feel empathy. In this study, 32 participants

130

completed a two-week diary study measuring daily helping behavior.
Participants later underwent an fMRI task assessing empathic responses
to naturalistic stimuli. Participants viewed images of sad events under
three conditions: watching naturally, under cognitive load, and while
instructed to empathize. Across conditions, higher levels of self-reported
experienced empathy were associated with greater activity in medial
prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Activity in MPFC was also correlated with
daily helping, and this activity predicted daily friend helping even controlling for trait empathy. Additionally, high trait empathy participants
displayed greater self-reported empathy and stronger MPFC responses
than low trait empathy individuals under cognitive load, suggesting that
empathy is more automatic for individuals high in trait empathy. Taken
together, these results suggest that MPFC plays a critical role in the
instantiation of empathic experience and behavior.

CHILDREN’S NEURAL RESPONSE TO MOTHER’S FACE: EFFECTS OF
EARLY CAREGIVING EXPERIENCES Nim Tottenham1, Mor Shapiro1, Eva

Telzer1; 1University of California, Los Angeles — A mother’s face is a highly

meaningful stimulus to a child, one which is discriminated both perceptually and affectively within the first year of life. The intimate motherinfant relationship provides opportunities for the child to learn to distinguish this face as an emotionally meaningful stimulus. Maternallydeprived children exhibit behaviors towards adults that suggest weaker
affective discrimination between caregivers and other adults. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural responses to mothers’ and strangers’ faces in typically-reared and
orphanage-reared children (who were later adopted). Typically-reared
children exhibited greater amygdala response to their mother’s face over
a stranger’s face, suggesting that the mother’s face is a unique stimulus
signaling a rich emotional contingency history. In contrast, children with
a history of early maternal-deprivation did not show an amygdala
response that differentiated mother’s from a stranger’s face, and this lack
of differentiation resulted from hyperreactive amygdala responses to
both individuals. Children who received the lowest quality of caregiving
were least likely to differentiate mother from stranger at the level of the
amygdala. These findings suggest that early maternal deprivation interferes with the typical process whereby a mother accrues special meaning
for the child and may, in part, explain why children with a history of disrupted caregiving are at risk for showing odd affiliative behaviors, such
as poor emotional attachments to adoptive parents and indiscriminate
friendliness towards strangers. These data also provide insight into the
nature of early learned emotional representations and suggest a sensitive
period such emotional learning.

Pierre Mendès France, 4Université de Savoie, Chambéry Cedex, France — Deficits in emotion processing in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared with
healthy aging have been inconsistently reported. This meta-analysis
aims to identify factors that might explain this inconsistency. We analyzed 23 studies published between 1996 and 2009 (databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed). Emotion processing abilities of Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI, N = 112) and AD (N = 504) patients have
been compared with those of healthy older adults (HOA, N = 519) using
varying methodologies (type of emotion task, stimuli modality and kind
of emotion) that can moderate the presence of a deficit. Weighted
Cohen’s d effect sizes and confidence intervals have been calculated to
assess differences in emotional processing abilities between patients
(MCI and AD) and HOA. Compared to HOA, the MCI and AD patients
were impaired for emotional recognition when tasks (i.e., emotional discrimination, naming, matching, selection and rating), modality of stimu-

lus (i.e., visual, audio, audiovisual) and kind of emotions (e.g., happy,
fear, anger) have been collapsed. Interestingly the presence of impairment was found to depend on the methodology used in the studies. AD
patients were not impaired in the emotional rating task, suggesting an
intact emotion experiencing. Moreover, a relative preserved recognition
of happy emotions was present in AD while surprise and specifically
fear were impaired. These selective impairments in emotional processing
could reflect progressive degree of brain structures degeneration, such
as amygdala and other limbic structures. Through a better understanding of mechanisms underlying emotional processing, this study could
help to clarify the diagnosis at earliest stage of AD.

University, 4Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies — We investigated training-related changes in psychophysiological responses to aversive emotional images in an intensive meditation retreat. Startle eyeblink
magnitude and cardiac deceleration were assessed in response to images
depicting scenes of human suffering (e.g., illness, loss, starvation, injury)
or threat (e.g., human violence, threatening animals). Matched participants were assigned to training (N=23) and wait-list control (N=22)
groups and tested onsite at a remote meditation center at the beginning
and end of training. Training consisted of three months of practice in
meditative techniques designed to foster increases in attention, vigilance,
and emotional balance. Participants viewed counterbalanced sets of positive and negative images from the International Affective Picture System. Images were accompanied by bursts of white noise (50ms, 100dB
peak SPL) occurring at 1500ms, 4500ms, and 7000ms following picture
onset. Startle magnitude (50ms baseline to 20-120ms post-probe peak
rectified EMG amplitude) and cardiac deceleration (2s baseline to 04500ms post-picture maximum estimated interbeat interval) were quantified for each trial and averaged across picture content. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed training-related decreases in startle magnitude
and cardiac deceleration to scenes depicting threat. Additionally, at posttest the training group showed significantly greater cardiac deceleration
to scenes of human suffering. Consistent with the goals of contemplative
practice, these results suggest a decreased emotional reactivity to threatening stimuli as a function of training, as well as greater engagement
with images of human suffering. Furthermore, responsivity to human
suffering was related to time spent practicing loving-kindness meditation, a technique aimed at promoting benevolent aspirations towards
oneself and others.

A CAUSAL FRONTO-TEMPORAL NETWORK FOR THE DECODING OF
EMOTIONAL PROSODY. Sascha Fruehholz1,2, Leonardo Ceravolo1,2, Didier

Grandjean1,2; 1Neuroscience of Emotion and Affective Dynamics Lab,
Department of Psychology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland, 2Swiss
Center for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland — We
used angry and neutral human utterances to reveal brain activations
during implicit (gender decision) and explicit processing (prosodic discriminations) of vocal emotional tones during high resolution functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans covering the superior
temporal, inferior frontal and medial limbic cortices. We found significant brain activations related to angry compared to neutral voices independent of the task in right middle (mSTG) and posterior superior
temporal gyrus (pSTG) and in left inferior frontal cortex (IFC). Left
mSTG and pSTG as well as right IFC were only active during implicit
processing, whereas bilateral amygdalae were only active during explicit
processing. Furthermore, we found specific activation in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) during explicit processing in bilateral basal

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

ganglia during implicit processing. A psycho-physiological interaction
(PPI) analysis revealed bi-directional connectivities in a fronto-temporolimbic prosody network. Finally, a sequential approach using dynamic
caudal modeling (DCM) and Bayesian model selection (BMS) revealed a
right hemispheric network where feed-forward signals in the STG network mainly converge in pSTG. The amygdala sends feed-forward signals to this STG network during explicit processing, but there is a bidirectional information flow between the IFC and the STG network during implicit processing. Together, these data suggest (1) common as well
as distinct brain regions during explicit and implicit processing of emotional prosody, (2) a high interconnectivity in this brain network, and (3)
a causal network with the pSTG as central voice sensitive regions receiving and exchanging information with limbic and IFC regions depending
on the task requirements.

DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSE TO FOOD IMAGES PREDICTS DIET OUTCOME:

S. Bruce3, Joseph E. Donnelly2, Cary R. Savage1; 1University of Kansas Medical
Center, 2University of Kansas, 3University of Missouri-Kansas City — One third

of the United States population is obese (body mass index [BMI] ? 30 kg/
m2), and many individuals regain lost weight within one year. Previous
neuroimaging studies have shown that obese and healthy weight individuals respond differently to food cues and hunger states, as do successful dieters compared with individuals who are not dieting. The
current study sought to extend the present literature by using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate baseline brain function in a group of dieters, then identifying those who lost weight (successful) and those who did not (unsuccessful). Prior to beginning a diet
intervention, 66 obese participants were scanned while viewing food
and nonfood images before and after eating a standardized meal. Participants who had lost ? 7% of their pre-diet body weight at the conclusion
of the 12-week intervention were considered successful. Results showed
a cluster of differential responding in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).
In this region, unsuccessful dieters responded more to meal state and
stimulus type than did successful dieters. Specifically, unsuccessful dieters showed greater OFC activation (food versus nonfood) than successful dieters, a pattern that was most pronounced post-meal compared
with pre-meal. In contrast, successful dieters did not show differential
responding to meal state or stimulus type in the OFC. Increased OFC
activation pre-diet may predict an individual’s ability to lose weight. It is
possible that unsuccessful dieters continue to experience food stimuli as
highly rewarding even after eating, contributing to chronic overeating
and difficulty losing weight.

DISTRACTOR PROCESSING IN HEALTHY YOUNG AND OLDER ADULTS: AN
ERP STUDY Ana Ramchurn1, D. Bunce1; 1University of London & Brunel
University, UK — Research into the global precedence effect suggests that
visual processing of the “whole” (e.g., a large letter H) takes place before
processing of its constituent parts (e.g., little letter Fs). In the context of
age, older adults produce disproportionately slower RTs responding to
local targets when the global letter is incongruent with local letters (i.e.,
interference), suggesting a reduced ability in older adults to inhibit
salient information. Although several behavioural studies have demonstrated the global precedence effect and interference in older adults, less
work has explored the role of inhibition using electrophysiological methods. In the present study, healthy young (M = 25 years) and older (M =
74 years) adults performed a Global-Local task with simultaneous
recording of their electrophysiological activity. Event-related potentials
were extracted, and analyses focused on the N2 component. Analyses of
behavioural RTs indicated that while older adults were significantly
slower than younger adults overall, global interference in local responding was similar for both age groups. Larger N2 for incongruent (vs. congruent) stimuli suggested that N2-related processing is greater when
successfully responding to targets simultaneously presented with con-

131

flicting distractor information. While there was no age difference in N2
for local-responding, older adults exhibited smaller N2 than young
adults for global-responding, suggesting that the source of the slower
RTs in older adults was due to greater distractor processing. Discussion
focuses on the implications of these findings for age differences in the
processing of salient distractor information.

GREATER AUTOMATIC FACIAL MIMICRY FOR MORE SOCIALLY
REWARDING FACES: EVIDENCE FROM A FACIAL ELECTROMYOGRAPHY
(EMG) STUDY Thomas Sims1, Carien M. van Reekum1, Tom Johnstone1,
Bhismadev Chakrabarti1,2; 1Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and
Neurodynamics, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Science,
University of Reading, 2Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry,
University of Cambridge — Facial mimicry, which occurs both uncon-

sciously and spontaneously during social interaction, represents a rudimentary form of empathy. Social psychological studies have shown that
people tend to mimic those who they like more. This has led to the proposal that more rewarding social stimuli elicit greater automatic mimicry. To test this, Thirty-two participants (26 females) took part in an
implicit reward conditioning paradigm which was used to manipulate
the reward value associated with four neutral target faces. The participants subsequently viewed short video clips of the same target faces
making happy and angry emotional expressions, while facial EMG was
recorded from the Corrugator Supercilii (CS) and the Zygomaticus
Major (ZM) muscles as a measure of automatic facial mimicry. While
watching the happy expressions, participants showed significantly
higher activation in the congruent muscle (ZM) to faces associated with
high rewards, than in response to those associated with low rewards (all
p<0.05). No difference was observed for the incongruent muscle (CS)
response to the happy faces. No significant differences were observed for
angry faces associated with different reward values. These results suggest that reward value of a socially rewarding stimulus (e.g. a happy
face) can modulate the extent of automatic facial mimicry. Given the central role of facial mimicry in mediating emotion understanding, this
result has a crucial implication for conditions such as Autism Spectrum
Disorders, where a deficit in automatic facial mimicry has been
observed.

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN RESPONSE TO A COMMON NOISE
DISTRACTION Veronica Galvan1, Mat Golley1, Maddie Lenard1, Ankita
Dhar1, Ross Kendall1, Kandice Ocheltree1, Cynthia Gutierrez1; 1University of
San Diego — Psychosocial stressors reliably elicit a stress response in both

males and females. However, there are gender differences that depend
on the type of stressor: males are more likely to be stressed by achievement stressors, while females are more likely to be stressed by social
rejection. Our study sought to examine the effects of a common, ‘everyday’ distractor, overheard conversations. Subjects were pre-screened via
a telephone interview for stress-related diseases, recent surgery, etc;
females both on and off oral contraceptives were asked to participate
during days 16-24 of their menstrual cycle. Subjects believed they were
participating in a study examining school performance. While they were
doing an SAT task, they were exposed to different types of conversation
carried on by a confederate(s). Saliva was sampled two times before
(baseline) and four times after the exposure (post-immediate, posttwenty, post-forty, and post-sixty). Survey results indicated that both
males and females were irritated by the conversation distractor. Hormone analysis revealed a cortisol peak eight minutes after conversation
initiation and declined thereafter. Analysis by gender revealed that
males and females were affected by different types of conversation.
Although the type of conversation may have caused these differences,
the situation surrounding saliva sampling may also have been a factor.
Males had higher cortisol levels when surrounded by two female confederates (a possible achievement stressor), while females had higher
cortisol responses when accompanied by a single female confederate.

Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Maastricht, Maastricht,
the Netherlands, 3Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts
General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA — Humans rap-

idly recognize and understand facial expressions of others, as shown by
numerous behavioral and neuroimaging studies. An important factor
that may influence this recognition process is the context in which the
face is perceived. Affective scenes have already shown to influence an
ERP component (the N170) of facial expressions, indicating that the face
is already at an early stage encoded differently in an affective context.
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tried to investigate the
influence of an emotional scene on the neuronal processing of fearful
and neutral faces. Fourteen participants were being scanned while they
were shown photographs (248 trials) of either a fearful, neutral or no face
in a fearful, neutral or scrambled scene. To stay focused, they had to
respond to an oddball. The experiment consisted of four runs of 31
blocks. Eight stimuli were presented per block for 800 ms with an interval of 350 ms. Also, a functional localizer for the perception of faces, bodies, houses and tools was used. As predicted, we found that activity for
fearful faces in right fusiform gyrus increases when they are embedded
in a fearful scene. In addition, parahippocampal place area and retrosplenial complex show less activation for a scene when it is fearful. Most
interestingly, extrastriate body area is highly responsive to a fearful
facial expression embedded in a threatening scene, even though there is
no body visible. Moreover, this area responds to the threatening scene
when there is a neutral face and even without face.

NEURAL BASIS OF SELF-TRANSCENDENT EMOTIONS DEMONSTRATED
THROUGH INTER-SUBJECT SYNCRONI-ZATION OF CORTICAL ACTIVITY
DURING FREE-VIEWING James Morris1, Jonathan Haidt1, Zoe Englander1;
1

University of Virginia — To date, most research investigating the neural
basis of moral emotions has been dedicated to emotions that give rise to
negative evaluations of others (e.g. anger, disgust). Emotions triggered
by the virtues and excellences of others have been almost completely
ignored. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural basis of two self-transcendent emotions – Admiration for Physical Skill (AD), and Moral Elevation (EL) caused by witnessing acts of moral beauty. Ten participants
viewed the same nine video clips, three belonging to the AD condition,
three belonging to the EL condition and three belonging to a neutral condition. We then performed pair-wise voxel-by-voxel correlations of the
BOLD signal between individuals for each video clip and a separate resting-state run. Replicating prior work, we found a high degree of intersubject synchronization, regardless of stimulus condition, across several
brain regions during free-viewing of videos. EL videos evoked significant inter-subject synchronization in brain regions previously implicated
in self-referential and interoceptive processes, including medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and insula. The degree of synchronization was
highly variable over the course of the videos, with the highest amount of
synchronization occurring during portions of the videos that were rated
by later judges to be most emotionally arousing. These same brain
regions did not show high synchronization for either neutral or AD videos. Results suggest that inter-subject synchronization may provide a
new and useful tool for understanding moral emotions.

mental disorder characterized by a manipulative interpersonal style and
increased risk for violent offending, is also associated with an impaired
ability to recognize fearful facial expressions. Previous literature has
demonstrated that this impairment can be remedied when attention is
redirected to critical cues, specifically the eye region of fearful faces.
However, it is unclear whether this improvement elicits genuine empathy or reflects a compensatory mechanism that may be less likely to facilitate prosocial behaviours (‘pseudo-empathy’). In the current study,
fMRI was used to examine the activity of empathy-related brain regions
in a community sample of individuals with high versus low psychopathic traits (N=28) while completing an emotion recognition task
involving fearful, happy, angry, disgusted, and neutral faces. Facial features were isolated systematically so that participants were exposed to
intact faces as well as partial face stimuli consisting of only the most or
least diagnostic features. We then contrasted activity between the most
diagnostic (eyes only) and the least diagnostic condition (eyes removed)
of fearful faces. Preliminary results of these analyses reveal that when
viewing the least diagnostic features of fearful faces, participants with
high psychopathic traits show reduced activity in neural regions associated with emotion (amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex), and attention (fronto-parietal network), relative to their low psychopathic trait
peers. These findings suggest that neurocognitive systems responsible
for orienting attention to salient facial features functions abnormally in
individuals with high psychopathic traits.

DO ALL THREATS WORK THE SAME WAY? EVIDENCE FOR EARLY
DIVERGENCE AND LATER CONVERGENCE IN FEAR AND DISGUST
PROCESSING Elizabeth Krusemark1, Wen Li1; 1University of Wisconsin —
The literature on threat processing has been dominated by an almost
exclusive focus on fear, resulting in limited knowledge about other
meaningful threat emotions (e.g., disgust). In two studies, we compared
analysis of fear versus disgust emotions at early and later stages of the
cognitive stream. The first study (N=43) examined early visual eventrelated potentials (VERPs) to images eliciting disgust, fear or neutral
emotion in combination with a basic visual search task presented immediately after the image. Visual ERPs indicated enhanced response to fear
images and suppressed activity to disgust images, relative to neutral
images (p’s<.001). Tracking this profile, fear facilitated and disgust
delayed visual search performance (p’s<.001). These findings thus suggest that fear and disgust instigate opposite sensory and attentional processes at an early stage. The second study (N=40) concentrated on later
processing by examining how these threat images modulated responses
to a neutral object (a greeble) that followed about 425 ms (jittered) later.
We replicated differential VERPs to fear and disgust images shown in
Study 1. Strikingly, N170 to greebles (emerging about 600 ms post image
onset) was comparable when preceded by disgust or fear images (nevertheless, more pronounced than that subsequent to neutral images;
p’s=.001). In parallel, distance estimation of greebles (as a measure of
social avoidance) was equivalent between fear and disgust trials (but
more proximal than neutral trials; p’s<.01). Together, these results highlight the dynamic temporal course of threat processing, evolving from
relatively mandatory sensory discrimination to later functional convergence to motivate adaptive behavior.

O'Hara1; 1Stanford University School of Medicine — Anxiety and insomnia

co-occur in older adults (Magee & Carmin, 2010). More specifically, anxiety and poor sleep efficiency (SE) are associated in older women (Spira
et al., 2009). Also, recent evidence suggests that serotonin transporter
gene promoter region (5-HTTLPR) genotype moderates the relationship
between stress and subjective sleep quality (Brummett et al., 2007). We

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

investigated whether any association of anxiety and sleep efficiency is
similarly moderated by 5-HTTLPR genotype. 102 community-dwelling
older adults (43 males, 59 females, mean age 71.18) completed the Beck
Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(STAI). Participants were genotyped using Polymerase chain reaction
amplification, and assessed with in-home full ambulatory polysomnography for SE. We measured self-report of sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We found no significant associations
when regressing BAI scores on age, SE, presence of the 5-HTTLPR short
(s) allele, and the interaction of 5-HTTLPR and SE. In secondary analysis,
PSQI scores were significantly associated with the interaction of 5HTTLPR genotype and SE (p=.03). Contrary to our expectations, we did
not find any relationship between SE and anxiety, nor between SE, 5HTTLPR genotype and anxiety. However, our results do indicate that 5HTTLPR genotype moderates the impact of inefficient sleep on subjective sleep quality and suggest that individuals with the s allele may be
more emotionally or cognitively affected by sleep disturbances. This differential sensitivity may help explain discrepancies observed in studies
relating objective to subjective sleep quality.

CHILDREN’S UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIALLY-RELEVANT CATEGORIES:
THE ROLE OF THE AMYGDALA IN RACIAL/ETHNIC CATEGORIZATION
Eva Telzer1, Mor Shapiro1, Kate Humphreys1, Nim Tottenham1; 1University of
California, Los Angeles — Successful social development depends on iden-

tification of context-relevant social categories. A salient social category is
race/ethnicity, which develops early. Three-month-old infants show
preferences for own-race faces, and 3-year-old children often show a bias
in favor for European-Americans and a prejudice for ethnic minorities.
Developmental psychologists have been attempting to understand
whether racial biases are rooted in ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation, or culturally learned associations. The current study uses neuroimaging techniques to examine how children construct an understanding
of socially-relevant categories. Children, 4-17 years (40% EuropeanAmerican, 23% Asian-American, 15% African-American) completed a
functional MRI scan during which they matched faces (European-American, African-American, and Asian-American) based on emotion. Additionally, we measured children’s self-reported attitudes towards
African-Americans and their neighborhood ethnic diversity. Results
indicate that children do not report negative, prejudicial biases towards
African-Americans but report that the majority of African-Americans
have good characteristics such as friendly, smart, not ugly, and not bad.
In addition, the more ethnically diverse children’s neighborhoods, the
more positive their attitudes are towards African-Americans. Finally, the
more positive children’s attitudes towards African-Americans, the
greater bilateral amygdala activity they show to African-American relative to European-American faces. This finding suggests that the developing amygdala is not signaling threat or negative valence to these facial
images but is signaling previously learned social associations for these
stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that racial biases may reflect
culturally learned associations shaped through one’s neighborhood context, and these biases do not necessarily reflect derogation of traditionally stigmatized groups, but may be positive in nature.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF RISK-TAKING IN RISK-AVERSE
ADOLESCENTS Adriana Galván1, Tara Peris1, Kristine McGlennen1;
1University of California, Los Angeles — Adolescents

are typically characterized as risk-takers. Relative to children and adults, they show heightened risky behavior and exaggerated neural activation in dopamine-rich
circuitry during reward processing and risky choice. However, not all
adolescents are risk-takers. Anxious youth in particular show greater
risk aversion than their non-anxious counterparts and display decreased
risk-taking behavior. In this study, our goal was to examine neural correlates of risk-taking in these risk-averse youth to determine whether riskaversion in adolescence is associated with decreased ventral striatal
recruitment (contrary to age-typical patterns of activation) or whether

exaggerated ventral striatal activation characteristically observed in nonanxious adolescents is observed in the absence of heightened risk-taking
phenotypes. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), anxious and non-anxious adolescents (ages 13-17) performed a
modified version of the Cups Task, which is designed to assess risky
choices under positive and negative contexts. Behaviorally, anxious
youth made less risky choices than non-anxious youth. This behavioral
difference was associated with less ventral striatal activation in anxious
versus non-anxious youth. However, both groups showed similar patterns of activation in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and parietal regions.
These data suggest that while cortical circuitry may be conserved across
adolescence regardless of risky behavior, ventral striatal regions may
specifically influence risky behavior. Further, this study shows that we
can gain traction in the neural correlates of risky behavior in adolescence
by examining age-matched adolescents who differ on risk-taking phenotypes.

POSTNATAL ADVERSITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRED EMOTIONAL
LEARNING DURING CHILDHOOD Kathryn
L.
Humphreys1,
Nim

Tottenham1; 1UCLA — Learning about the emotional contingencies of environmental stimuli is a fundamental means of navigating the world independently. Rodent studies show that these processes are dramatically
impaired by postnatal maternal deprivation (Sullivan et al., 2006). We
examined emotional learning using a simple associative learning task in
a sample of children with typical and atypical early life experience. We
hypothesized that, consistent with the rodent literature, the ability to
learn about emotional contingencies would be impaired following postnatal maternal deprivation in the form of institutionalized care. Previously institutionalized (PI) and comparison children were administered
a task in which balloons could be pumped for an initially unknown
number of times to collect reward (if balloon exploded from too much
pumping, reward was lost). Three different balloon colors were associated with either a high, low, or variable number of pumps to explosion.
A significant interaction was found by caregiving condition and balloon
contingency (F=2.41, p<.05), where comparison children showed evidence of learning these associations by the end of the task and PI children did not show such evidence. This failure to learn the contingencies
by the PI group was associated with the PI group making fewer pumps
in total (F=4.48,p<0.05). Thus, the impaired ability to recognize response
contingencies was associated with more inhibited behavior by the PI
group. These findings suggest emotional learning is impaired following
early caregiver deprivation and are consistent with our previous work
showing atypical development of neural circuitry involved in emotional
learning (e.g., the amygdala; Tottenham et al., 2010a, 2010b).

DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN RESPONSES TO VALENCED STIMULI IN A
COGNITIVE CONTROL CONTEXT James Porter1,2,3, Paul Collins1,2, Ryan
Muetzel1,4, Monica Luciana1,2,3; 1University of Minnesota, 2Center for
Neurobehavioral Development, 3Center for Cognitive Sciences, 4Center for
Magnetic Resonance Research — The neural mechanisms of reward pro-

cessing are of particular interest to the study of adolescent risk-taking.
FMRI studies show the striatum, especially nucleus accumbens (NAcc),
and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to be reliable neural correlates of
reward anticipation. The NAcc is associated with the presence of
rewards and the absence of punishments, though recent studies indicate
NAcc may be equally responsive to the onset of both aversive and appetitive stimuli. Additionally, there is evidence that adolescents show
greater NAcc response to rewards compared to children and adults, and
that adults show greater prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity. The current
study examined brain responses to the onset and offset of appetitive and
aversive visual stimuli in a healthy developmental sample (ages 11–24,
N=31). Participants performed a novel fMRI task designed to elicit cognitive control over emotional reactivity. Participants experienced discrete time intervals via visual displays, and then had to accurately
reproduce the intervals in order to win money. The image content on

134

each trial varied by valence: positive/appetitive, negative/aversive, or
neutral. Robust fMRI activation was seen in hippocampus, amygdala,
caudate, putamen, NAcc, OFC, and dorsolateral (DL) PFC. Image onset
activated OFC, DLPFC, and primary visual cortex. Image offset engaged
these areas, as well as hippocampus, amygdala, insula, ventrolateral
PFC, middle temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and secondary visual
areas. Positive images elicited significantly greater NAcc response to
image onset and offset, compared to negative images. Developmental
effects within these regions, and implications for risk-taking behavior,
will be discussed.

AGE DIFFERENCES IN AMYGDALA FUNCTIONAL CONNEC-TIVITY DURING
REST Michiko Sakaki1, Matthew Sutherland1, Lin Nga1, Mara Mather1;
1

University of Southern California — Cognitive decline in normal aging has
been associated with gray matter loss and anatomical disconnection
across brain regions that ordinarily function together. In line with this
idea, past studies revealed that healthy older adults show decreased
activity of the ”default-mode network” and reduced correlations among
brain regions involved in this network (Damoiseaux et al., 2008). While
many cortical regions in the default mode network decline with increasing age, the gray matter volume of the amygdala is relatively preserved
in older adults (Grieve et al., 2005). This suggests the possibility that the
functional connectivity of the amygdala is not disrupted among older
adults. To examine this, we compared functional connectivity during
rest in older people (N = 20; age range 61-78) with younger people (N =
20; age range 19-37). Consistent with previous findings, we observed
greater involvement of posterior cingulate in the default-mode network
of younger adults than of older adults. However, using the amygdala as
a seed region revealed stronger functional connectivity in older people:
Both the left and right amygdala had greater positive connectivity with
the occipital and temporal lobes in older people than in younger people.
Similar age-related increases in amygdala functional connectivity were
found during fixation periods during a task in the same participants and
during rest in another independent group of participants. These results
indicate that aging is not always accompanied with reductions in the
functional connectivity across brain regions, and that the amygdala has
stronger functional connectivity during rest as people get older.

STRUCTURAL BRAIN CORRELATES OF SUCCESSFUL STRESS
REGULATION IN CHILDREN Jamie Hanson1, Moo Chung1, Brian Avants2,

Elizabeth Shirtcliff3, James Gee2, Seth Pollak1, Richard Davidson1; 1University
of Wisconsin-Madison, 2University of Pennsylvania, 3University of New
Orleans — The ability to regulate one’s behavior in stressful conditions is
an essential component of successful human adaptation. Such regulatory
processes are likely subserved by a complex constellation of interconnected brain regions. One outstanding question is whether particular
brain regions important for regulation operate in a domain-general manner, and are predictive regulatory behavior across a variety of contexts.
In this study, we examined the neurobiological correlates of stress regulation in a sample of typically developing children (n=61; mean age=11.8
years) using a tensor-based morphometry analytic framework to analyze
structural MRI. Intensive interviews were conducted with parents and
children about functioning of the child participant at school, at home,
with friends, and within the family. We hypothesized that successful
regulation of stress would be related orbitofrontal morphometry as
research in non-human animals and humans have implicated this region
in adaptive control of behavior in changing environments. Using Logical
AND conjunctions that combined four correlations between voxel-wise
Jacobian determinants (a metric of volumetric contraction or expansion)
and interview ratings of stress regulation in different contexts, we found
a significant association between successful stress regulation across multiple life domains and larger volumes in the orbitofrontal cortex (minimum correlation r>.436;p=~0.00000001 uncorrected). In addition to the
oFC, volumetric properties of the cuneus were related to functioning
across multiple domains of behavior (minimum correlation

r>.374;p=~0.00000001 uncorrected). For both regions, smaller volumes
were related to poorer functioning across all domains. These findings
suggest regulatory (oFC) and attentional (cuneus) regions may be
involved with domain-general stress regulation and functioning.

TASK GOALS AND ACHIEVEMENT MINDSET INFLUENCE ATTENTION TO
FEEDBACK AND LEARNING SUCCESS IN A CHALLENGING MEMORY
TASK Sylvia Rodriguez1, Belen Guerra2, Tory Higgins1, Jennifer Mangels2;

1Columbia University, 2Baruch College, City University of New York — Achievement goals have an important influence on learning success, in part by
directing how attention is oriented toward task-relevant information.
Particularly in challenging task situations, a focus on mastery of the
material (mastery focus) is considered to be more adaptive than a focus
on proving ability relative to others (performance focus) because it keeps
attention oriented toward learning rather than toward cues of potential
failure. Other research suggests, however, that task engagement benefits
most from congruence or “fit” between the individual’s mindset and the
goals emphasized by the environment, even if both are performance oriented. The current study investigated how both task goals and participant mindset influence attention toward, and the ability to learn from,
feedback in a difficult memory retrieval task. One task block was framed
to emphasize performance; the other to emphasize learning. Eventrelated potentials (ERPs) were recorded to performance (accuracy) and
learning (correct answer) feedback after each trial. Performance framing
biased attention toward negative accuracy feedback, as evidenced by an
enhanced late positive potential (LPP; 400-600 ms), with endorsement of
performance goals additionally predicting the extent to which this LPP
was sustained (800-1000 ms). Mastery framing biased attention toward
learning-relevant feedback, as evidenced by an enhanced inferior temporal negativity (200-600 ms) that also predicted successful encoding of this
information. Although a mastery mindset was most predictive of learning success in the mastery frame, a performance mindset was most beneficial in the performance frame. This “fit” effect suggests that attention to
performance feedback does not necessarily undermine learning.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE E-I
PERSONALITY DIMENSION UNDER STRESS In Jae Hwang1, Kyung Hun

Han1, Sang Eun Chi1, Eung Suk Kim1, HyunTaek Kim1; 1Korea University —
Humans have different coping strategies to deal with stress in same
stressful situations, according to individual differences in personality.
The present study investigated the differences of the underlying neural
mechanisms between Extroversion and Introversion by using eventrelated potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG). In the experiment, 40 subjects (age range 19-28 years; 16 males & 24 females) were
assigned to two groups (20 E-extroversion, 20 I-introversion) according
to the Korean version of the Eysenck Personality Scales. Subjects performed a visual cognition task, both without a stressor (No-stress condition) and with a stressor (Stress condition) during the ERP recording.
Subsequently, EEG was recorded in two different conditions (eyes-open
and -closed) in each experimental condition (Stress and No-stress). The
behavior measure was obtained from State-Trait Anxiety Inventory in
each session. The present study showed: (1) In the ERP response, N1, P2,
and P3 peak amplitudes decreased significantly in E-group in Stress condition; and (2) The Alpha band (8-13Hz) in I-group increased significantly at Fz, Cz, and Pz sites (in the eyes-closed condition) after
removing the stressor. In addition, the Beta and gamma bands (13-30Hz,
30-50Hz) increased significantly in E-Group. The main findings were
that the E-I personality trait can manifest itself by the characteristics of
ERP and EEG in Stress and No-stress conditions. These results suggest
that the introversion group tends to be able to relieve tension and to be
relaxed, whereas the extroversion group tends to turn their attention to
other stimuli and/or to seek other interests in No-stress condition.

THEORY OF MIND BRAIN REGIONS ARE SENSITIVE TO THE CONTENT, NOT
THE STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY, OF BELIEF ATTRIBUTIONS Jorie Koster-

Hale1, Rebecca Saxe1; 1Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Previous
work has found that a distinct group of brain regions, the ‘Theory of
Mind network’, responds to reading or thinking about other people’s
thoughts, beliefs and desires. We investigated whether ToM regions are
sensitive to two dimensions along which mental state attributions can
vary: (1) structural (syntactic) complexity and (2) content of belief. Our
stimuli consisted of vignettes describing someone’s belief . The content
of the belief was mundane or socially-relevant (thoughts about e.g.
housework and haircuts or scandal and sexual relations). The form the
belief description was either first-order (‘John thinks that …’) or higherorder (‘John thinks that Mary believes that he thinks that…’). In each
participant, we defined functional regions of interest (ROIs) for regions
implicated in ToM (contrasting False belief > False photograph stories)
and in language processing (False Photograph stories > lists of NonWords). Most ToM regions - temporo-parietal junction bilaterally, precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex - show significantly higher response
to beliefs with socially-relevant content, compared to mundane content;
none showed a higher response to embedded than to first-order belief
attributions. By contrast, most language regions were sensitive to syntactic embedding - left inferior frontal gyrus and left temporal lobe show a
higher response during higher-order than first-order belief attributions,
while left angular gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus show a higher
response during first-order attributions. We conclude that ToM regions
are sensitive to the content, but not structural complexity, of belief attributions, while many language regions are sensitive to the structural
complexity.

ATYPICAL EEG AND TMS ACTIVITY DURING PAIN OBSERVATION IN

AMPUTEES WHO EXPERIENCE SYNAESTHETIC PAIN Bernadette

Fitzgibbon1, Peter G Enticott1, Melita J Giummarra1, Richard Thomson1, Nellie
Georgiou-Karistianis1, John L Bradshaw1; 1Monash University — For
some
people, observing pain in another person causes the sensation of pain to
oneself; ‘synaesthetic pain’. Early reports indicate that this experience is
not uncommon among amputees with phantom pain. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to determine if amputees who experience synaesthetic pain process observed pain differently to controls. While
observing pain-related images, we compared the EEG response of amputees who experience phantom pain and synaesthetic pain, to that of
amputees who experience phantom pain but not synaesthetic pain, and
to healthy controls. We found that the pain synaesthete group showed
reduced event-related potentials (ERPs) components at certain electrode
sites, and reduced theta and alpha band power at a central electrode over
the sensorimotor cortex compared to controls. We speculate that the
observed reduction in ERP amplitude and theta band power may reflect
inhibition of the processing of observed pain, perhaps as a protective
strategy, and that the reduced alpha band power may indicate a disinhibition of processes that may result in synaesthetic pain. Complimenting
this finding is preliminary transcranial magnetic stimulation data implicating increased pain-related inhibition in pain synaesthetes compared
with controls. These findings demonstrate the first documentation of
atypical neurophysiological activity in pain synaesthetes when observing pain in another person.

Poster Session E — Monday, April 4, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse
may exert on empathic processes. Here we sought to examine how a
dimension of interdependent self-construal style reflecting how readily
one engages in processing the internal states of others may modulate the
automaticity of empathic processing among participants from individualistic (i.e., United States) and collectivistic (i.e. Korea) cultures. Using
cross-cultural fMRI, we examined how an index of ‘other-focusedness’
modulated neural activity when Caucasian-Americans and Koreans
viewed scenes of others in emotional distress without being required to
engage in empathic processes. Whole-brain regression revealed that
greater levels of ‘other-focusedness’ was associated with greater reactivity in regions that process pain and empathy such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right anterior insula (AI). Cross-cultural
comparisons revealed that this relationship between activity in the ACC
and right AI with ‘other-focusedness’ was stronger among Korean relative to Caucasian-American participants. Furthermore, whole-brain
regressions conducted independently among the members of the two
cultures revealed that greater levels of ‘other-focusedness’ among Koreans, but not Caucasian-Americans, corresponded with greater reactivity
in the ACC, bilateral AI, and medial prefrontal cortex. These findings
suggest that interdependent social processing styles may have different
consequences for empathy within collectivistic and individualistic cultural contexts, and that culture and interdependence may interact to
determine how automatically empathic processes are engaged.

SEARCHING FOR THE HUB VOXELS OF FMRI DATA WITH THE
HYPERGRAPH MODEL Joon Shik Kim1, Eun-Sol Kim1, Byoung-Kwon Lim1,
Byoung-Tak Zhang1; 1Seoul National Univeristy — Traditional

functional
magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies focus on the activation contrast
between different tasks during an imaging. Hub voxels of emotion are
brain regions which are in common over many categories of emotion.
We used a hypergraph model to endow each voxel with a centrality, i.e.,
importance rating. The Pittsburgh brain activity interpretation contest
(PBAIC) 2007 fMRI data were used with 7 emotion categories. Seven
emotional categories include “annoyed angry”, “arousal”, “body”, “dog
visible”, “dog”, “faces”, and “fearful anxious”. We extracted the voxels
whose correlation values were larger than 75% of the maximum correlation value between each emotional rating and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. A hypergraph is a collection of hyperedges, which
contain a number of vertexes. In our study, hyperedges are emotional
categories, and the vertexes are the voxels correlated with each emotional state. A hypergraph can be described with an incidence matrix (E).
An adjacency matrix (A) can be obtained by the operation E(transpose)E,
where (i, j) element of A is the number of hyperedges which contain i-th
and j-th voxels. The eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue of an adjacency
matrix was selected where each of its elements represents the centrality
of each voxel. In our analysis, voxels in occipital lobe, precuneus and
precentral gyrus were observed to have high centrality. Visual, visuospatial, and motor areas seem to play an important role in emotion processing during a video game experiment.

for Biomedical Imaging, Mass General Hospital — Volcano. Samurai. Spicy.

Immense. Rouse. Surprise. There seems to exist a small class of words
that are highly salient, but neutral or ambiguous in their emotional
valence. These words, though often omitted in studies of emotional language, are required for a full evaluation of the impacts of valence,
arousal, and their interactions on word processing. We used eventrelated potentials (ERPs) to investigate the time-course of processing
positive, negative, and neutral words that were either high or low in
arousal, by presenting 468 self-paced single words to participants as they
responded to randomly inserted probe words (animals). In addition, the
influences of concreteness (high, low) and frequency (high, medium,
low) on emotional word processing were evaluated. Word groups were

136

matched such that any one-way or two-way analysis could be performed
without confounds by collapsing across variables (valence, arousal, concreteness, or frequency) not being assessed in that analysis. Using this
robustly matched and expansive word set, the amplitude of the late positivity was the same to positive, negative and neutral words, once effects
of arousal were controlled. Instead, arousing words evoked a larger positivity than non-arousing words. This effect was most pronounced for
emotional words, but it was also elicited by neutral stimuli. These results
suggest that the late positive component often elicited with emotional
stimuli is more a marker of arousal than either emotion per se or emotional valence. Important considerations for past and future experiments
of emotional language are also discussed.

PERCEIVING EMOTIONAL VALENCE OF PICTURES: RELATIVE
HEMISPHERIC COMPETENCE AND THE ROLE OF HEMISPHERIC
INTERACTION Andrew Hughes1, Barbara Rutherford1; 1UBC Okanagan —
Two hypotheses of relative hemispheric competence for emotional processing were tested: The emotional valence hypothesis predicts a right
hemisphere advantage for processing negative emotions and a left hemisphere advantage for positive emotions, while the right hemisphere
hypothesis predicts a right hemisphere advantage for emotion, regardless of valence. Also tested were predictions that hemispheric interaction
reduces efficiency of processing simple stimuli and benefits the processing of complex stimuli. Two experiments presented pictures at fixation,
with a distractor to the left visual field or right visual field or with no distractor at all. Experiment two also included a double distractor condition. Response time and accuracy to classify the picture as pleasant or
unpleasant were recorded. Results revealed faster and more accurate
responses to positive than negative pictures, suggesting positive pictures
are more simple to process than negative. Positively-valenced pictures
also were more efficiently processed by the left than the right hemisphere and hemispheric interaction reduced efficiency. Negatively-valanced pictures were better processed by the right than the left
hemisphere, but were were most efficiently processed using the combined hemispheres. Taken together, the results support the valence
hypothesis and suggest that task complexity impacts the outcome of
hemispheric interaction.

IS BEING FEMALE PROTECTIVE AGAINST AUTISM SPECTRUM
DISORDERS? OXYTOCIN AND VASOPRESSIN LEVELS IN CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS Meghan Miller1,2, Marjorie Solomon1,3, Karen Bales3,
Sandra L. Taylor3, Jong Yoon3, Michael Minzenberg3, Cameron S. Carter3;
1MIND Institute, 2UC Berkeley, 3UC Davis — Male predominance of autism

spectrum disorders (ASD) is estimated at 4 to 1. It has been theorized
that processes mediated by oxytocin (OT), and lack of reliance on arginine vasopressin (AVP), make being female protective against autistic-like
behavior (Carter, 2007). This study (1) examined blood plasma levels of
OT and AVP in girls and boys with ASD and typical development, and
(2) related OT and AVP levels to autism and internalizing symptom
measures. Plasma OT and AVP levels and symptom measures were
obtained from 72 children ages 8-18: 39 with high-functioning ASD (18
girls, 21 boys) and 33 typically developing children (15 girls, 18 boys).
OT and AVP levels were modeled as a function of time of blood draw,
age, gender, and diagnosis. There were significant effects of gender on
OT levels (girls higher, Cohen’s d = .47) and blood draw time on AVP
levels (p = .013), and marginally significant effects of diagnosis on OT
(ASD higher, Cohen’s d = .43) and gender on AVP (boys higher, Cohen’s
d = .44). Higher OT values were associated with higher anxiety in girls
and worse pragmatic language in boys and girls. OT and AVP levels
were positively associated with restricted and repetitive behaviors in
girls with ASD, while AVP levels were negatively associated with these
behaviors in boys with ASD. Results are inconsistent with the suggestion
that OT levels are lower in individuals with ASD and are suggestive of
common and distinct roles of OT and AVP in boys and girls.

Russell1, Michael Kostolnik1, Jeremy R Gray2, Colin G DeYoung1; 1University of
Minnesota, 2Yale University — Identifying associations between personality

traits and brain structure is an important step in constructing a systematic understanding of how biology subserves individual differences in
behavior. DeYoung et al (2010) identified distinct regions where brain
volume correlated significantly with four of the Big Five personality
traits in gray and white matter. The present study sought to replicate
and refine DeYoung et al.’s findings using Freesurfer’s cortical reconstruction software. Analysis of the relation of Big Five traits to cortical
thickness was performed in a group of 98 healthy male adults aged 20-40
years. Results indicated multiple distinct regions associated with each
personality trait. Areas overlapping with DeYoung et al.’s (2010) results
were identified for Extraversion (orbitofrontal cortex; related to reward
sensitivity), Agreeableness (superior temporal sulcus; related to action
interpretation), and Neuroticism (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex;
involved in emotion regulation). Additionally, we identified a large area
of the cingulate cortex related inversely to Openness/Intellect, the one
trait not previously linked to regional volume. The cingulate is thought
to monitor conflict during simultaneously active mental representations,
a complex process which involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
which may relate to the role of Openness/Intellect in cognitive flexibility
and perceptual inclusiveness (DeYoung et al., 2005). These results indicate that certain brain regions appear robust in their relation to individual traits; observed differences between the current results and those of
DeYoung et al. (2010) suggest that the structural morphology of gray
versus white matter has both independent and interaction effects associated with individual differences in behavior.

DOPAMINERGIC CONTROL OF HUMAN EMOTIONS Rajendra

Badgaiyan1; 1SUNY at Buffalo, 2Harvard Medical School — Animal experiments have suggested that dopamine neurotransmission is involved at
various stages of emotional processing. Its role in the processing of
human emotions however is unclear. We used a dynamic molecular
imaging technique to detect, map, and measure dopamine released during emotional processing in healthy young volunteers. The technique
exploited the competition between endogenous dopamine and its ligand
for receptor occupancy. To exploit this competition, we intravenously
injected radiolabeled dopamine receptor ligand (either 11C-raclopride
for detection of dopamine released inside the striatum or 18F-fallypride
for detection outside the striatum) and asked the volunteers to perform a
task that elicited negative emotion. The task consisted of a control and a
test condition. In the control, volunteers were shown emotionally neutral
words and in the test condition emotional words were presented. Each
stimulus was presented for 4500 msec (ISI 5 sec) and volunteers were
asked to rate the intensity of emotion elicited by each word in a scale of
1-3. During the experiment, we measured the ligand concentration using
a PET camera. Based on the concentration, the rate at which the ligand
displaced from the receptor sites was estimated using a receptor kinetic
model. We observed that the rate increased significantly (indicating
endogenous release of dopamine) in the caudate, putamen, amygdala,
medial temporal lobe and the frontal cortex during presentation of emotional words (test condition). The results indicate that human emotions
are processed by dopamine and that the dynamic molecular imaging
technique can be used to study neurochemical control of human cognition.

m2). In obesity, the neural systems of reward are hyperresponsive to
food rewards. Behavioral studies find increased levels of impulsivity
among obese individuals. The current study used functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural systems of reward in
response to food cues before and after eating among individuals beginning a 3-month diet. Twenty-three high impulsive and 19 low impulsive
participants were selected from an ongoing study based on scores from
the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Participants were scanned
while viewing images of food and animals before and after eating a standardized meal. Results showed differential activation of the orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) between high and low impulsive obese participants in that
before eating both high and low impulsive participants responded more
to food than non-food cues. On the other hand, after eating high impulsive participants continued to show increased activation to food cues.
However, there was no significant difference in weight loss following
the 3-month diet between high and low impulsive participants. The
observed activation of the OFC indicates that high impulsive participants continue to evaluate food as rewarding even after eating which in
turn may make it more difficult for them to control their eating behaviors, yet this difference at the beginning of the diet does not impact their
ability to lose weight while on a strict 3-month diet.

ACUTE STRESS ENHANCES DEFAULT MODE NETWORK ACTIVITY 15-25
MINUTES LATER David Clewett1, Andrej Schoeke1, Zara Abrams1, Mara

Mather1; 1University of Southern California — While stress-induced impairment of cognitive function has been observed in goal-directed paradigms, little is known about the influence of acute stress on resting state
network activity. One possibility is that enhanced default mode network
(DMN) activity after stress contributes to executive deficits in learning
and memory. In the present study, we used pulsed arterial spin labeling
(PASL) to measure differences in healthy male adults’ resting state
changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) following a cold pressor
stress induction task versus a control task, with the stress and control
conditions conducted on different days. Salivary cortisol was measured
before and after each scanning session as a hormonal indicator of the
autonomic stress response. Following stress induction, there was an
interval filled with instructions and preparations for entering a 3T MRI
scanner. During the period of peak cortisol response to acute stress (fifteen to twenty-five minutes after stress induction), participants were
asked to rest for six minutes with their eyes closed during a PASL scanning sequence. There was enhanced activity in the precuneus cortex,
anterior cingulate cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, fusiform cortex and left caudate in the post-stress condition compared with the control. Non-stress (control condition) resting activity was marked by
significantly higher activation in the cerebellum and primary somatosensory cortex. Our results support the notion that stress biases resource
allocation towards nodes in the DMN. Stress-induced DMN activity may
reflect increased self-referential processes and global vigilance, representing a prioritization of vital life functions over cognitive demands.

RELIABLY QUANTIFYING THE VALUE AN INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNS TO GIVING

Vanderwerff1, Richard J Davidson1; 1University of Wisconsin-Madison — Most

individuals recognize the value of both selfish and other-oriented motivations, and it is clear that there are large individual differences in these
motivations between individuals. Although quantifying and increasing
other-oriented behavior is of great societal interest, little is known about
how to reliably measure other-oriented preferences. In order to address
this question we developed a novel economic game to quantitatively
measure individual differences in willingness to give to others. Specifically, we gave 72 subjects 200 forced choice monetary decisions between
money for themselves ($0-$10) and money for a stranger ($0-$10). To
precisely quantify the amount of money an individual was willing to
sacrifice to give a dollar to a stranger (i.e. their indifference point or

strated substantial variability in IP across subjects (µ=.85, ?2=1.91), suggesting that the majority of individuals do not behave purely selfishly or
altruistically. Additionally, we observed that IPs were significantly correlated with related constructs such as self-reported willingness to
donate to a stranger (r=-.23, p=.05). We further demonstrated the reliability of self-other IP as a measure of individual differences by re-testing 45 subjects between 2 and 14 weeks after their original test, in the
same task. We observed significant correlations between IPs across time,
(r=.48, p=.0008) suggesting that individual differences in IP are reliable.

WHITE MATTER TRACT INVOLVEMENT AS A PREDICTOR OF POST-STROKE
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS Ana Soper1, Nina Dronkers1,2, Juliana Baldo1,

And Turken1; 1VA Northern California Healthcare System, 2University of
California, Davis — Depressive symptoms are common sequelae of stroke

within the chronic phase of recovery (?1 year post-CVA). While there is
debate about association between lesion location and depression, the
contribution of white matter tract involvement is unknown. We examined whether white matter involvement differed between individuals
reporting at least mild depressive symptoms (“depressed”; n=13) and
those below cutoff for mild depressive symptoms (WNL; n=16). Twentynine left hemisphere stroke patients were assessed with the Geriatric
Depression Scale at least one year post-CVA. To examine white matter
tract involvement, we overlaid tracts (from JHU and Juelich probabilistic
tract mapping) onto each individual patient’s digitized lesion reconstruction, and then coded degree of each lesion’s involvement in the tract
on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 3 (lesion fully
bisected the tract). Aphasia severity was assessed with the Western
Aphasia Battery, which did not distinguish the two groups. Among 9
tracts tested, logistic regression showed that the greater the degree of
cingulate gyrus (CG) involvement, the greater the probability of being
classified into the depressed group (?2 (1) = 4.99, p = .03). Illustratively,
individuals with at least moderate CG involvement (2 on our scale) had
over 90% probability of being in the depressed group. The single predictor of CG involvement accounted for 25% of total variance in depressive
symptoms. CG involvement accurately classified 69% of the people into
depressed vs. WNL categories. This is the first study to implicate specific
white matter tract involvement with chronic depressive symptoms in
stroke patients.

FAILURE OF RAPID AMYGDALA HABITUATION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH AN
INHIBITED TEMPERAMENT Jennifer Blackford1, Amil Allen1, Suzanne

Avery1, Ronald Cowan1; 1Vanderbilt University School of Medicine — Inhibited temperament is a trait that represents differences in behavioral
responses to novelty. Inhibited individuals typically avoid new people,
places or objects whereas uninhibited individuals approach novelty.
Individuals with an inhibited temperament are at increased risk for
social difficulties, including social anxiety disorder. We recently discovered that individuals with an inhibited temperament show a sustained
amygdala response to newly familiar faces, in contrast to the reduced
amygdala response seen in individuals with an uninhibited temperament. It is unknown whether a failure in amygdala habituation underlies
the sustained amygdala response in inhibited temperament. In the
present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we examined rapid amygdala habituation to novel faces in young adults with an
inhibited (n = 19) or uninhibited temperament (n = 20). Participants
viewed 6 novel, neutral faces randomly presented twice within each of
four 18-s blocks. Habituation was defined as a decrease in amygdala activation between the first and last blocks. Across all subjects, both the left
and right amygdala showed significant habituation. An area in the right
amygdala (15 voxels, 405mL) showed a significant difference in habituation between the two groups (p < .05, corrected). In the uninhibited individuals, the right amygdala habituated over time, as expected. However,
in individuals with an inhibited temperament, the right amygdala failed
to habituate. Therefore, avoidance of novelty in inhibited temperament
may be mediated by a failure of the amygdala to habituate rapidly.

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANTERIOR INSULA VOLUME Nicole

Giuliani1, Roshni Bhatnagar1, Emily Drabant1, Kateri McRae1,2, James Gross1;
1Stanford University, 2University of Denver — A common emotion regulation
strategy, expressive suppression, involves the minimization of the outward expression of emotion. This requires an individual to constantly
monitor both emotional and bodily states. The anterior insula is theorized to play a crucial role in both of these tasks: emotional awareness
(Craig, 2003) and the perception of autonomic and bodily changes
(Craig, 2003; Pollatos, et al., 2007). A separate literature has established
the causal relationship between engaging in regular cognitive or physical behaviors and the volume of brain regions associated with those
behaviors (May, 2008). Therefore, we hypothesized that frequency of
suppression usage, as measured by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross & John, 2003), would be positively associated with anterior
insula volume, as measured by manual volumetric region of interest
(ROI) measurement. Indeed, suppression usage positively correlated
with bilateral anterior insula volume in two separate samples of healthy
adults (Sample 1: r = 0.32, p = 0.02, N = 51; Sample 2: r = 0.66, p = 0.005, N
= 16). A control regulation strategy, cognitive reappraisal, was not
related to insula volume in either sample (all p-values > 0.75). A complementary voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach yielded comparable findings. These results are consistent with the idea that expressive
suppression engages prolonged interoceptive monitoring of autonomic
states and facial expression.

ACTIVITY IN STRIATAL DOPAMINERGIC CIRCUITRY DURING MUSICAL
REWARD CONSUMPTION PREDICTS SUBSEQUENT PURCHASES

Valorie N Salimpoor1,2,3, Iris van den Bosch4, Alain Dagher1, Robert J
Zatorre1,2,3; 1Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, 2International
Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research (BRAMS), 3Centre for
Interdisciplinary Research in Music, Media, and Technology, McGill University,
4Utrecht University — In a previous [11C]raclopride PET study, we demonstrated that dopamine is released in response to music. Few can pinpoint
exactly why they like a piece of music, yet the desire to achieve specific
musical experiences is highly potent, reflected by tremendous amounts
of money spent on music in our society. Using fMRI, we examined
whether activity in the dopaminergic reward circuit during the experience of a musical reward (consumption phase) could predict its subsequent purchase. An auction paradigm was applied to determine how
much individuals were willing to pay for musical excerpts heard inside
the scanner. Newly released music that was geared towards participant
preferences but unfamiliar was used to rule out any specific episodic
associations. Contrasting items that participants subsequently spent the
maximum amount on with those not purchased revealed robust activity
bilaterally in the nucleus accumbens and the right caudate, similar to
those that were found to release dopamine during peak moments of
emotional arousal in the previous study with familiar music. What is
notable is that here we used entirely novel musical stimuli without any
prior associations or episodic memory traces that could activate the striatal dopaminergic system; any responses observed are exclusively due
to the music. Importantly, BOLD increases were also found in the ventral
tegmental area, the primary source of dopaminergic input to the striatum while participants were listening to excerpts subsequently purchased, compared to those that were not. These findings demonstrate
that activity in the dopaminergic circuit during reward consumption
predicts subsequent music purchases.

scale to explore hypotheses regarding relationships between brain biochemistry and core personality traits(Costa Jr and McCrae 1995). Specifically, we examined regions within the Default Mode Network (DMN)
including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the precuneus. The
DMN is implicated in internally focused tasks, likely to be important to
stable personality functioning, such as autobiographical memory
retrieval and perspective taking (Raichle, MacLeod et al. 2001). We
hypothesized that brain biochemistry within the PCC and precuneus
would predict scores on the Big Five. We obtained proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) and personality functioning
(NEO-FFI) from 60 healthy participants (27 Females). Subjects did not
differ significantly in terms of age (mean = 23.4; S.D.=3.7), sex, or intelligence (IQ=115; S.D.=8). We found that lower concentrations of Creatine
in the PCC predicted higher levels of Neuroticism (F=5.5, p<.05, r2=.09).
In contrast, subjects with higher levels of Creatine in the PCC exhibited
higher levels of Conscientiousness (F=9.04, p=.004, r2=.14). Finally,
lower Creatine within the white matter underlying the precuneus predicted higher Extraversion (F=5.6, p<.05, r2=.09) and Agreeableness
(F=8.3, p=.006, r2=.13). Creatine’s role in the storage and transmission of
phosphate-bound energy serves as an indicator of increased energy use
within neurons that have higher Creatine concentrations. Thus, our
results suggest that variation in the energetic functioning of neurons in
the Default Mode Network is related to four of the Big Five personality
traits, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness.

MY BETTER SELF IS VIRTUAL: HOW AVATARS CAN COMPENSATE FOR A
LOW SELF-ESTEEM Shanti Ganesh1, Hein T. Van Schie1, Floris P. De
Lange1, Daniël H. J. Wigboldus1; 1Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The
Netherlands — Goal: Previous studies suggest that players of online role-

playing games tend to view their virtual alter-ego, or avatar, as more
positive than they view themselves. Players’ level of self-esteem may
mediate this trend. The aim of this study is to investigate the cognitive
neural processes that subserve this compensation effect. Methods: Using
functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 22 players of World
of Warcraft and 21 matched non-gaming controls, while they rated the
applicability of positive and negative personality traits to themselves,
avatar, close other and distant other on a five-point Likert scale. Controls
rated their favorite cartoon character instead of avatar. Results: Preliminary results indicated that players rate themselves as more negative than
controls do. Players did not rate avatars as more positive than self. A
negative correlation between player’s self-esteem and positive avatarratings confirmed the compensation effect in players. Conversely, controls showed a projection effect, as self-esteem positively co-varied with
positive ratings for cartoon and familiar other. Data also indicated
greater neural reactivity to positive and negative traits of self and avatar
in players, relative to controls. Within players, we observed this reactivity only for self and avatar, but not for familiar others. Stronger motor
activations were associated with more positive ratings of self and avatar.
Interestingly, avatar-related activity in the visual cortex showed positive
correlations with both higher self-esteem and unfavorable avatar ratings.
Conclusions: These results illuminate the cognitive neural processes subserving the compensation effect, and extend our knowledge about inclusion of avatars in the human self-concept.

THE MIRROR VIEW: HEMISPHERIC SPECIALIZATION OF SELF-FACE
RECOGNITION Yuan Hang Li1, Eran Zaidel1,2; 1Department of Psychology,

UCLA, 2Brain Research Institute, UCLA — Self-faces are seen more in the
mirror view than in the camera view. We examined the effect of mirror
reversal on recognition of faces of self or of a friend in the left or right
visual hemifields. Results showed a significant interaction of face-type
(self, friend) x image reversal (camera, mirror) x visual field of presentation (left, right). Self-faces, but not faces of friends, in the right visual
hemifield, were recognized more accurately in the mirror view than the
camera view. However, both views were recognized equally well in the
left visual hemifield. This was true when faces were presented at differ-

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

ent angles (left profile, left 45?, right 45?, and right profile), but not when
presented as head-on views. We conclude that face recognition is qualitatively different in the two visual hemifields (hemispheres) and that
self-faces are processed differently than faces of friends, but only in the
unspecialized left hemisphere. We suggest that in the left hemisphere
head-on views can be identified using relatively fast neurons that are
invariant to left/right asymmetry (Freiwald & Taso, 2010) and are subcallosally mediated (Zaidel, 1994). Profile views must be identified using
face recognition units that are view-invariant (e.g., Quiroga et al., 2005).
We further argue that the view-invariant system is sufficiently efficient
in the right hemisphere to be insensitive to the familiarity effect of mirror
reversal. By contrast, the view-invariant system in the left hemisphere is
less efficient and therefore sensitive to the familiarity effects “offered” by
(mirror) non-reversed stimuli.

A ROSE BY ANOTHER NAME?: MOTIVATION ENGAGES UNIQUE NEURAL
SUBSTRATES OF BIASED SOCIAL COMPARISON Brent Hughes1, Jennifer

Beer1; 1University of Texas at Austin — People may cope with self-esteem

threat by exaggerating how positively they compare to peers. Yet exaggerated positivity has been associated with information-processing limitations that, in some circumstances, generate exaggerated negativity
which could threaten self-esteem. This raises the possibility that selfesteem threat elicits exaggerated positivity through a distinct mechanism. Previous neural research associates exaggerated positivity with
reduced frontal lobe activation but has not manipulated threat. Is exaggerated positivity elicited by threat associated with the reduced frontal
lobe activation identified in previous research? The current study tested
the neural associations of the effect of self-esteem threat on social comparative judgments (rather than the effect of information-processing limitations manipulated in previous neural research). Exaggerated
positivity elicited by threat increased activation in orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), amygdala, and insula. Individual differences in exaggerated positivity correlated with medial OFC and
MPFC activity. The findings suggest that although exaggerated positivity may appear similar at a behavioral level, it may be that unique mechanisms underlie exaggerated positivity when it is a response to selfesteem threat.

MEDIAL PREFRONTAL ACTIVITY DURING SELF- AND OTHER- DIRECTED
AFFECT JUDGMENTS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IS RELATED TO
AGE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIVENESS Brent Vander Wyk1, Kevin Pelphrey1;

1
Yale University — Adapting a task by Ochsner and colleagues (Ochsner et
al., 2004), children and adolescents were scanned using fMRI, while they
made judgments about their own feelings about emotional pictures
(Self), the feelings of people depicted in the pictures (Other), or the location of where the picture was taken (Location). Processing during the
Self judgment condition relative to Location judgments engaged a broad
network of regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporal poles, bilateral superior temporal sulci, and the precuneus. These
regions were also active during Other judgments, but less robustly. In
particular, activation during Self judgments was significantly larger than
during Other judgments in a dorsal region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To investigate the relative cortical activation of each condition within the mPFC we constructed two regions. The first region was
defined by an activation likelihood analysis from previous literature on
affective judgments. The second region was defined from a functional
connectivity analysis during rest using a precuneus seed. Within these
independently delineated regions within the mPFC, we observed that
Self > Other > Location. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation
between the degree of selectivity of activation to Self within an individual and their age, and a negative correlation between this selectivity and
deficits in social responsiveness, as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (Constantino et al., 2003). We argue that these data are consistent with the view that the mPFC region is dedicated to self-directed
modes of mentalizing

DEVELOPMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN HIERARCHICAL COGNITIVE
CONTROL Lauren M. McShane1, Sara Haas1, Dima Amso1, David Badre1;

Brown University — It is established that the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
undergoes a protracted developmental course that continues through
late adolescence (Gogtay et al., 2004). Notably, the maturation of PFC is
accompanied by an increased capacity for cognitive control of thought
and action (Diamond, 2002). However, subregions of PFC display considerable heterogeneity both in their developmental time course and in
their functional contribution to cognitive control (Bunge et al., 2002).
Recent evidence in adults has suggested that subregions of PFC are organized in a hierarchical manner (Badre and D’Esposito, 2009). In this functional hierarchy, more abstract cognitive representations in rostral PFC
guide selection of less abstract action representations, in caudal PFC, that
are more closely tied to motor actions. However, to date, little is know
about the relationship between PFC maturation and the development of
this hierarchical organization. To begin to address this question, we
tested children (8-12 years) and adolescents (13-15 years) on two tasks
previously associated with cognitive control (Badre and D’Esposito,
2007). To manipulate the level of abstraction, the Response experiment
required choosing a manual response based on the color of a cue (1st
order selection), while the Feature experiment required choosing a set of
feature-to-response mapping rules based on a colored cue (2nd order
selection). Preliminary results indicate age related differences in overcoming competition at these different levels of abstraction. The results
have important implications for our understanding of both the development of cognitive control function and the way that cognitive control is
organized in the brain.

WHEN COMPENSATION FAILS: PERCEPTUAL DEFICITS IN HIGHER AGE
CAUSED BY VISUAL DISTRACTION Edmund Wascher1; 1Leibniz Research
Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors — Cognitive

changes
associated with normal aging are widespread, including attention, working memory and episodic memory. The most influential explanation of
these deficits is the assumption of “general slowing”, and the “inhibitory
deficit hypothesis”, which proposes that the impairments in cognitive
abilities are due to an inability to control interference of task-irrelevant
information. In a recent study, Gazzaley (2008) investigated possible
interactions between general slowing and inhibitory deficits in a working memory task. They found evidence for a direct interaction between
alterations in neural processing speed and the ability to suppress irrelevant information. Based on this thesis, aged people are able to perform
as accurate as young participants in various tasks if they have sufficient
time. Following this approach the present study investigated the ability
to process relevant signals that were simultaneously accompanied by
salient irrelevant stimuli. Older adults showed severe deficits in processing such competing stimuli. Early asymmetries in the EEG indicated that
they were unable to sufficiently control the distracting information.
However, they showed reliable latency effects both on early sensory
components of the EEG and the fronto-central N2 that can be assigned to
executive control. Moreover, the latency of the latter component reliably
correlated with detection accuracy. Thus, general slowing might determine the control of distracting information. However, if, interference on
a sensory level distorts the early representations of incoming signals,
compensatory mechanisms cannot restore distracted information.

COMPARISONS IN THE MEMORY FOR INTENTIONS SCREENING TEST FOR
YOUTH: THE IMPORTANCE OF GENDER, TIME-DELAY, AND CUE TYPE
Julianne Garbarino1, Ginger Mills1, Sarah Raskin1; 1Trinity College — Age

development has become an important question in prospective memory
(PM) research in children. In the current study 116 healthy children ages

140

5-14 were administered the Memory for Intentions Screening Test for
Youth (MISTY). The MISTY is a paper-and-pencil test that requires children to perform simple tasks such as “When I show you a book, turn it to
page nine” while completing a word search. Performance on this task
demonstrates the necessity of considering time delay and cue type when
interpreting results of PM studies in children. Also important are potential interactions between gender and both time delay and cue type.
Results show that older children’s performance does not differ significantly depending on whether the time delay is two-minute vs. tenminute or whether the cue is time-based vs. event-based. However,
younger children perform significantly better on two-minute than on
ten-minute cues and on event-based than on time-based cues. There are
no overall gender differences. Interestingly, results suggest that there
may be earlier development of short term PM (two-minute delay) in
females than in males, and also earlier development of event-based PM
in females than in males. The percent of errors that resulted from complete absence of response (prospective failures), declined greatly in
females between ages of 5-6 and 7-8. In males, the decline was not as
large. This is another indicator that gender may be a factor in the rate of
development of PM in children.

NEURAL INDICES OF IMPROVED ATTENTIONAL MODULATION OVER
MIDDLE CHILDHOOD Carter Wendelken1, Carol Baym2, Adam Gazzaley3,
Silvia Bunge1; 1University of California at Berkeley, 2University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, 3University of California at San Francisco — The ability

to control the focus of attention relies on top-down modulation of cortical activity in areas involved in stimulus processing, and this ability is
critical for maintaining items in working memory in the presence of distraction. Prior research demonstrates that children are less capable of
focusing attention, relative to adults, and that this ability develops significantly during middle childhood. Here, using fMRI and a face/scene
working memory task adapted from Gazzaley and colleagues (Gazzaley
et al. 2005), we compared top-down modulation in fifteen children (aged
8-13) and fifteen young adults (aged 19-26). Replicating prior results, in
young adults, attention to scenes modulated activity in the parahippocampal place area (PPA). Modulation of PPA activity increased as a function of age in children, and PPA activity was related to performance in
this group, on the working memory task as well on a test of subsequent
memory. Dorsolateral PFC also demonstrated increasing task-specific
activation, as a function of age, in children. The present findings support
the idea that children’s reduced ability to maintain items in working
memory, especially in the presence of distraction, is driven by weaker
top-down modulation of activity in areas involved in stimulus processing.

WHEN DO WE GET LOST? EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF AGING ON A
VARIETY OF TOPOGRAPHICAL ORIENTATION STRATEGIES Irene Liu1,2,

Giuseppe Iaria1,2; 1Neurolab, University of Calgary, 2Hotchkiss Brain
Institute — Individuals orient successfully in large-scale surroundings by
relying on a variety of cognitive strategies such as the use of environmental landmarks, the sequence of body turns, or the acquisition and use
of a mental representation of the environment (i.e. a cognitive map).
Although these strategies require similar cognitive processes such as
attention, perception, memory and decision-making skills, they also rely
on different spatial information such as environmental landmarks or
body-centered information. Here, we investigated the effects of aging on
the use of different strategies useful for orientation. The sample included
620 healthy individuals who performed, through the internet (www.gettinglost.ca), a comprehensive battery of tests assessing the use of different orientation strategies in virtual environments. We found that older
participants (46-88 years of age) performed worse than younger participants (Group 1: 31-45 years of age; Group 2: 18-30 years of age) in tests
assessing the ability to (1) form and make use of cognitive maps, (2) to
integrating body-centered information, and (3) to form associations
between environmental landmarks and body turns. No differences were

negative-going ERP component is manifested during the retention
period in visual working memory (VWM) paradigms, increasing in
amplitude with the number of items held in VWM (e.g., McCollough et
al., 2007). The current study examined age differences in this component,
hypothesizing that younger children would exhibit greater amplitude
compared to older children at all levels of VWM load, reflecting greater
effort to hold representations in VWM. Participants were divided into
two groups: a young age group of eleven 8-9 year olds, and an older age
group of fifteen 12 year olds. The VWM paradigm (Vogel et al., 2001)
presented a 100ms memory array of 2, 4, or 6 colored squares, followed
by a 900 ms delay (retention period). Participants then indicated whether
a test array was identical to the memory array or differed by one color.
There were no group differences on accuracy for any memory load. ERPs
were averaged across four parietal-occipital electrode sites where the
retention-related component was maximal. Mean amplitude during the
retention period was calculated for trials with the correct response, and
was greater in young children than in the older children for the 4-object
condition (F (1, 24) = 4.90, p = 0.037), and marginally greater for 2 objects
(F (1, 24) = 3.55, p = 0.072). As hypothesized, differences in patterns of
brain activity between older and younger children, despite a lack of difference in accuracy, suggest younger children require greater cognitive
resources than older children to perform the VWM task.

Arthur P. Shimamura3, John Neuhaus1, Bruce Miller1,2; 1University of California
San Francisco, 2USCF Memory and Aging Center, 3University of California
Berkeley — Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characteristically associated with very poor self-awareness.
The cognitive basis of this deficit is poorly understood but impairment in
metacognition, the process by which we understand and alter our own
thinking, may underlie these deficits. Many different measures can be
used to assess metacognition and thus far only a few studies using a limited set of measures have examined FTD. Furthermore, metacognition is
often assessed without feedback about task performance, yet feedback
may be a major contributor to metacognition. We used a 20 item-paired
associate word paradigm to examine aspects of metacognition in
patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD,
n=12), as well as patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD, n=14) and agematched controls (n=35). BvFTD patients showed an aberrant pattern of
feeling of knowing ratings, limiting themselves to highly confident or
guessing ratings. AD patients did show impaired feeling of knowing;
however they were less impaired than bvFTD patients. Most strikingly,
patients with bvFTD failed to appropriately adjust their predictions
about future memory performance even after receiving explicit feedback
that they had performed worse than expected. These findings reinforce
previous research indicating that feeling of knowing is the metacognitive
task most specifically impaired with frontal lobe dysfunction, and they
highlight the effects of frontal lobe disease in preventing adjustment of
metacognitive knowledge in response to feedback. In addition, they provide additional insight about the profound lack of self-awareness in
bvFTD.

AN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF THE ORIGIN OF
COGNITIVE DECLINE IN AGING ADULTS DURING THE COLOUR WORD
STROOP TASK Clare Killikelly1, Denes Szucs1; 1University of Cambridge — It
is consistently found that aging adults are limited in their ability to
ignore distracting information while performing a cognitive task. The
loci of this cognitive limitation may be responsible for serious cognitive
deficits in older adulthood (Mager et al, 2007). We are therefore in the
process of identifying the specific neural correlates that underlie this limitation. Using electroencephalography (EEG), the brain activity of young
adults (aged 20-30) and older adults (aged 45-65) was examined as they
performed a manual version of the colour word Stroop task. This task
was designed to isolate the point in stimulus and/or response level processing when task irrelevant distracting information (ie word reading as
opposed to colour naming) induces interference in the brain (De Houwer, 2003). Young adults and older adults showed the same pattern reaction time and accuracy however, the underlying brain activity was
significantly different in older adults. It was found that older adults had
larger amplitudes and longer latencies for all the early stimulus related
components including P1, N1, P3a and P3b. Specifically the P3a component was significantly larger and delayed in older adults indicating additional processing was required for reorienting attention. Additionally
between 420-480ms after stimulus presentation there was a negative
depression (N450) which is related to response conflict. This was significantly enhanced in older adults. Overall these results indicate that with
age additional processing is required however there not a general compensatory process but compensatory mechanisms that are engaged to
serve specific stimulus or response related functions.

INHIBITORY CONTROL AND WORKING MEMORY IN YOUNG AND ELDERLY
ADULTS Liana Machado1, Natalie Wyatt1, Hayley Guiney1; 1University of
Otago — Debate persists regarding the nature of age-related deficits in
inhibitory control, and whether inhibitory control depends on the working memory system. The current research aimed to characterize agerelated changes in inhibitory control, and assess interrelationships
between inhibitory functions and working memory performance. To this
end, we measured performance in 60 young adults (18-30 years) and 60
elderly adults (60-88 years) on a range of established relevant tasks. The
results support age-related decrements in strategic inhibitory control
(demonstrated across several tasks: anti-saccade, Stroop, flanker,
Simon), and an age-related increase in reflexive inhibition (based on
inhibition of return elicited by an uninformative peripheral flash). This
combination of weaker strategic inhibition and stronger reflexive inhibition suggests age-related deterioration of cortical structures may allow
subcortical structures to operate hyperactively. In young adults, none of
the inhibitory measures correlated. In contrast, elderly adults showed
positive correlations between anti-saccade error rates, the flanker effect,
and the Simon effect. The emergence of correlations between inhibitory
measures in elderly adults may indicate that as the brain deteriorates
and capabilities decline, a common mechanism is recruited to compensate. Regarding working memory scores, age-related decrements
occurred, but few correlations between working memory and inhibitory
control measures arose in either age group. This indicates that inhibitory
control and working memory operate independently, and working
memory impairment cannot account for declines in inhibitory control.
Overall, the results suggest that aging promotes hyperactive subcortical
inhibitory control, hypoactive cortical inhibitory control that shifts
toward reliance on a unitary mechanism, and independent working
memory deficits.

requiring inhibitory control. Participants were adolescents (13-17 yearsof-age) with and without childhood histories of ADHD-Combined subtype who, as adolescents, showed a wide range of symptom severity and
impairment. During fMRI, subjects alternated between performance of
antisaccade (AS), prosaccade (PS), and mixed (AS and PS) tasks, and
extended periods of fixation. The design permitted estimation of trialrelated activation separately from sustained activation maintained
throughout periods of task performance (i.e., during AS, PS and mixed
blocks). Magnitudes of BOLD activation were correlated with symptom
and impairment scores obtained using standardized parent/teacher rating scales. Initial results from 42 subjects (including 21 typically-developing controls) implicate regions in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral
parietal cortex, and basal ganglia in the pathophysiology of ADHD, with
these regions showing reliable correlations between AS trial-related activation and specific symptom and impairment scores. Sustained activation in superior medial frontal cortex during mixed blocks varied
consistently with all ADHD-related symptom and impairment variables,
but not with age, performance or IQ. These results accord with dimensional views of ADHD and highlight the centrality of disruptions in sustained processing.

AGE-RELATED CHANGES IN CONFLICT AND ERROR PROCESSING
Jessica Strozyk1, Ines Jentzsch1; 1University of St Andrews — According to the

conflict monitoring theory of cognitive control, people monitor for the
occurrence of conflict in information processing in order to evaluate the
need for control adjustments. Conflict monitoring has previously been
shown to be impaired in older adults. In this study we investigated this
effect in a middle-aged group using an adaptation of the flanker task in
which conflict was additionally manipulated by independently varying
the contrast of target and flanker letters. Effects of this manipulation on
both behavioural and electrophysiological measures were analyzed. A
significant effect of contrast on the compatibility effect confirmed that
the conflict manipulation was successful. Control adjustments in form of
the post-error slowing effect were also affected. Despite a general slowing for middle-aged adults, neither conflict size nor post-error slowing
was affected by age. However, both the error-related negativity (ERN)
and the error positivity (Pe), two components of the event-related potential that have shown to be reduced in amplitude in older adults and that
have previously been linked to post-error slowing, were reduced in
amplitude in the middle-aged group. These findings challenge previous
interpretations of these components.

A SILVER LINING: HOW AGE DIFFERENCES IN EMOTION REGULATION
CAN BE USED TO ATTENUATE DEFICITS IN LEARNING Marissa
A.
Gorlick1, Brian D. Glass1, Brittany N. Nix1, Mara Mather2, W. Todd Maddox1;

University of Texas, Austin, 2University of Southern California — Toward the

end of life, goals shift from acquiring knowledge to developing social
relationships (Carstensen, 2006). This manifests itself as a “positivity
bias”; an increase in processing positive emotional experiences (Mather
& Carstensen, 2005). However, this positivity bias requires cognitive
control processes and it reverses when cognitive control resources are
taxed (Mather & Knight 2005; Knight et al., 2007; Isaacowitz et al. 2009).
Present research asks whether these processing biases can be used to
attenuate cognitive deficits associated with normal aging. Under low
cognitive control demands, we predict that learning will be better for
positively-valenced feedback. However, under high cognitive control
demands, we predict that learning will be better for negatively-valenced
feedback. We also predict larger effects for emotional feedback (e.g.,
happy and angry faces) than for logical feedback (e.g., gains or losses in

142

points). In line with our prediction, Nashiro et al. (2010) found better
learning for positively-valenced emotional feedback in older adults in a
low cognitive control demanding task. The current study examined
learning in a task that loaded heavily on cognitive control processes (a
modified Wisconsin Card Sort Task). In line with our prediction, we
found better learning for negatively-valenced emotional feedback in
older adults, and no effect of valence for logical feedback. Computational models were applied to the data (Bishara et al., 2010) that provide
some important insights onto the locus of the learning effect in older
adults. Analysis of potential dopamine and serotonin genetic predictors
of performance are ongoing.

DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN BRAIN ACTIVITY SUPPORTING WORKING
MEMORY Laura Dewey1,2, Michael A. Motes1,2; 1University of Texas

Southwestern Medical Center, Psychiatry, 2University of Texas at Dallas, Center
for BrainHealth & School of Behavioral & Brain Sciences — Goals: Previous
research shows that several regions of the human brain follow a quadratic developmental trajectory (Geidd et al., 1999). The gray matter volume of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to peak around 13 years of
age before decreasing, possibly as a function of pruning. However, few
studies exploring the corresponding developmental trajectories in functional activation have been conducted. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research in adults shows the involvement of PFC
in supporting working memory (WM). Thus, this study sought to
explore the relationship between PFC activity during a working memory
(WM) task and age in a group of adolescents. Methods: Twenty-six
healthy adolescents (aged 11 to 17) participated in the study. The participants completed a delayed-response WM task while fMRI data were collected. On each trial, participants studied either six or one letter (4 s
encoding phase), remembered the items over a (4 s) delay, and then
judged (within 3 s) whether a single probe letter was in the studied set.
An fMRI blocked design was used: four blocks per set-size and three trials per block (Philips Achieva 3T scanner: EPI volumes=147, TR=2 s;
TE=30 ms; slices=36 trans. 3.5x3.5x4mm; matrix=64x64). Results: Multiple regression was used to evaluate linear and quadratic relationships
between task-related BOLD signal-change per voxel and age. Quadratic
relationships were found for voxels within PFC (in addition to linear
relationships). Conclusion: These analyses provide evidence of a functional link between PFC gray matter volume changes occurring with
development and PFC functional activity supporting WM.

STRATEGIC MEMORY & REASONING TRAINING BENEFITS FRONTALMEDIATED EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN ADOLESCENTS Monique Salinas1,

Tiffani Jantz1, Neena Rao1, Mandy Maguire1,2, Matthew Brier1, John Hart Jr.1,3,
Sandra Chapman1, Jacquelyn Gamino1, Michael Motes1,3; 1Center for
BrainHealth,University of Texas at Dallas, 2Callier Center for Communications
Disorders, University of Texas at Dallas, 3University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center — The present study investigated effects of strategic memory and reasoning training (SMART) on executive function, particularly
inhibition and frontal activity among adolescents. SMART teaches hierarchical cognitive strategies that support higher-order reasoning, promoting the identification of deeper meaning in information and fostering
comprehension. Both before and after SMART (N=18) or an equivalent
waiting period (N=18), adolescents (aged 12-15) completed a response
inhibition task in which the required depth of semantic processing was
manipulated. The lowest level of semantic processing required only relatively simple feature-based discrimination (i.e., respond to a picture of a
single car [80% Go] but not a single dog [20% No-Go]); the next level
required more complex feature-based discrimination (i.e., respond to
multiple types of cars but not multiple types of dogs); and the highest
level required conceptual-based discrimination (i.e., respond to objects
but not animals). EEGs, response times, and accuracies were recorded.
For SMART participants, frontal (Fz) evoked potential amplitudes 300
ms (P3) increased across sessions for repeated exemplars and multiple

exemplars on Go trials. For controls, there were no Fz P3 differences
across sessions for Go trials for the different semantic processing conditions. For both groups, Fz P3 amplitudes increased across sessions for all
semantic processing conditions on No-Go trials, particularly concept
selection. Although SMART did not include the direct training of
response inhibition, SMART affected frontal-mediated executive processing used in response inhibition. SMART produced frontal changes
consistent with deeper semantic processing on concept selection trials
(i.e., Go trials) even when only simple feature-based discrimination was
required.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF PROCESSING SPEED: A COMBINED DTI-FMRI
STUDY IN HEALTHY AGING Ilana Bennett1,2, Meghana Karnic-Henry1,2,

Amanda Colby1,2, Bart Rypma1,2,3; 1Center for Brain Health, University of Texas
at Dallas, 2School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at
Dallas, 3Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center — Processing speed (PS) is a fundamental cognitive ability that
accounts for individual- and age group-differences in performance
across a wide range of cognitive tasks (e.g., Salthouse, 1996). However,
the neural substrates of PS are only recently being explored. In the
present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine the functional and structural correlates of PS in 21 younger and 19 older adults. During fMRI
acquisition, participants performed a modified digit-symbol substitution
task (DSST). PS was measured with the DSST as the time to indicate
whether a probe digit-symbol pair matched a pair from a simultaneously
presented array of nine digit-symbol pairings. Behavioral results
revealed that older adults were significantly slower, but not less accurate, than younger adults. Imaging results revealed that PS correlated
with both neural measures, with age group differences and similarities
in these relationships. That is, faster PS was associated with reduced
DSST-related neural activity in younger adults but increased activity in
older adults (e.g., L frontal pole), indicative of reduced neural efficiency
in aging. Faster PS was also associated with increased white matter tract
integrity across both age groups (e.g., genu of the corpus callosum),
indicative of monotonic age-related declines in structural efficiency.
Neural activity and white matter integrity from these interconnected
regions were not related to each other, suggesting that they make independent contributions to PS.

AMPLITUDE MODULATIONS AND PHASE-STABILITY OF ALPHA
OSCILLATIONS DIFFERENTIALLY REFLECT LIFESPAN DIFFERENCES IN
WORKING MEMORY CONSTRAINTS Myriam C. Sander1, Markus Werkle-

Bergner1, Ulman Lindenberger1; 1Max Planck Institute for Human
Development, Berlin — The capacity of visual working memory (WM)

shows an increase across childhood, a peak in young adulthood and a
marked decline with advancing age. Top-down control via a fronto-parietal network is thought to support selection and maintenance of information in WM and undergoes strong age related changes. Recently,
amplitude modulations of alpha oscillations (7-13 Hz) were suggested to
reflect interindividual differences in WM capacity and selectivity (Sauseng et al., 2005). Therefore, in the present study, children (CH, 11-13
years), younger (YA, 20-25 years) and older adults (OA, 70-75 years) performed a cued change detection task (Vogel et al., 2004). OA showed
lowest performance, followed by CH and then YA. Individual alpha frequencies (IAF) were determined to investigate the effect of WM-load on
lateralized alpha power changes over posterior regions during retention.
In line with previous reports, hemispheric alpha power differences
increased with WM demands in YA. However, in CH and OA, lateralized alpha oscillations increased only until WM limits were reached and
decreases thereafter, following an inverted u-shaped function. Those
results are interpreted to reflect decreased inhibitory control when WM
limits were overtaxed. Additionally, phase-stability after stimulus presentation was stronger in OA compared to CH and YA. The strong

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

entrainment of neuronal processing by external stimulation in OA may
imply less selective information uptake in OA. We conclude that differences in top-down guidance and information uptake as reflected in
amplitude modulations and phase-stability of alpha rhythms interactively determine WM constraints across the lifespan.

WHEN LESS IS REALLY LESS: AGING AND THE SPREAD OF INHIBITION

Brian Gordon1,2, Chun-Yu Tse2,3, Gabriele Gratton2, Monica Fabiani2;
1
Washington University in St Louis, 2University of Illinois, 3National University
of Singapore — Behaviorally even healthy aging is couple with a host of
cognitive declines (Park & Reuter-Lorenz et al., 2009). Functionally older
adults activate additional tissue compared to their younger counterparts
(Grady et al., 1999; Reuter-Lorenz et al., 2000, Cabeza 2002). As opposed
to their activations, older adults have reduced deactivation of the default
mode network (Lustig et al., 2003, Grady et al., 2006; Persson et al. 2007,
Braski et al., 2010). The current experiment investigated both cortical
activation and deactivation during a Sternberg working memory task.
The resulting whole brain analysis replicated previous work with older
adults recruiting more cortical areas while possessing less deactivation.
A novel region-of-interest (ROI) approach was taken to assess the consistency of blood flow around indentified functional peaks. This was done
utilizing spherical ROIs of increasing size from 3-13mm normalized by
the initial 3mm sphere. This transformed the data to represent a proportion of the peak activation or deactivation. The rate at which this value
declines with increasing sphere size represents homogeneity around the
peak. For each subject the values were obtained from a series of masks
representing the two anti-correlated networks and entered into an
ANOVA. The results from indicated that older adults had significantly
more homogenous spread of activation at larger sphere sizes. The spread
of deactivation was greatly impaired in the older adults suggesting a
particularly strong inability to spread inhibit these regions. These results
indicate both changes in the intensity as well as the spread of neuronal
activity with age.

A BIAS TO APPLY HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE IN LEARNING: A
COMPUTATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STUDY Anne G.E. Collins1, Michael

J. Frank1; 1Cognitive, Linguistic & Psychological Sciences Department, Brown
University — Growing evidence suggests that cognitive control is imple-

mented hierarchically in human prefrontal cortex, but how this structure
is acquired without instructions is poorly understood. Previous studies
have shown that people can learn hierachical structure when there is
incentive to do so (e.g., when it confers an advantage in terms of reducing memory load and interference, or when rules are temporally separated). However, it is unknown whether people naturally apply
hierarchical structure while learning in the absence of such incentives.
Participants performed a reinforcement learning task in which acquisition of stimulus-action associations could not benefit from a hierarchical
task representation. Nevertheless, a subsequent transfer phase assessed
whether participants had incidentally acquired the task with hierarchical
structure. Results showed a significant transfer effect, indicating use of
hierarchical representation of learned rules. Pre-transfer switch costs further allowed us to characterize individual hierarchical structures, and
predicted subsequent transfer effects as well as error types repartition.
We developed a novel learning and decision model based on a non-parametric hidden Markov model capable of learning hierarchical structure,
allowing us to make predictions on behavior and individual differences.
This model was pitted against full flat or mixture of flat experts learning
models. Only the proposed hierachical model accounted for all observed
effects, including individual differences. This study shows that subjects
have a propensity to build hierarchical structure regardless of its immediate utility (or even potential cost) for learning. Our model proposes an

143

approximate optimal inference framework that accounts for this hierarchical structure learning.

THE EFFECT OF A CONCURRENT EXECUTIVE WORKING MEMORY TASK
ON PAIN AND PLACEBO Jason Buhle1, Bradford L. Stevens1, Jonathan J.

Friedman1, Tor D. Wager2; 1Columbia University, 2University of Colorado,
Boulder — Previous research has argued that executive processes may

play a role in placebo analgesia (Wager et. al, 2004; Atlas et al., 2009;
Krummenacher et al., 2010). However, recent neuroimaging work by
Wager and colleagues (in press) has challenged this claim. To test these
competing hypotheses, we designed a novel paradigm that combined
transient thermal pain, performance of a difficult, 3-back, working memory task, and placebo drug treatment. An interaction between the task
and placebo conditions would provide evidence for the involvement of
executive processes in placebo analgesia. In the first of three sessions,
task difficulty and nociceptive stimulus intensity were individually calibrated for each participant (n = 26). Sessions 2 and 3 consisted of placebo
and control sessions, the order of which was counterbalanced across participants and controlled for in analyses. Participants rated each stimulus
immediately after it occurred on a continuous rating scale. Participants
reported less pain during the working memory task than during the no
task condition, F(1, 99) = 79.75, p < .001, and less pain during the placebo
and control sessions, F(1, 99) = 17.48, p < .001, but there was no interaction between the task and placebo conditions, F(1, 99) = .37, p = .54.
There was no difference in working memory performance between the
placebo and control sessions, F(1, 49) = .027, p = .87. Taken together,
these data suggest that the cognitive processes that support placebo
analgesia may be independent from those supporting executive function.

THE IMPACT OF FEEDBACK SCHEDULE ON ERROR EVALUATION WITHIN
MEDIAL-FRONTAL CORTEX Olave Krigolson1; 1Dalhousie University — The
frequency with which feedback is provided during skill acquisition has a
profound impact on learning. Contrary to intuition, research suggests
that learning is facilitated when feedback is provided on a reduced
schedule, i.e., not every trial (Winstein & Schmidt, 1990). While the
behavioral impact of a reduced feedback schedule appears to be quite
robust, the neural mechanisms that underlie the benefits of a reduced
feedback schedule remain unclear. To address this question, we had two
groups of participants perform a precision line drawing task while
event-related brain potential (ERP) data was recorded. One group of participants was provided with feedback after every attempt to reproduce a
target line length (full feedback). Conversely, the other group of participants was provided with feedback on every other experimental trial
(reduced feedback). An analysis of our behavioral data revealed a pattern of results consistent with previous behavioral findings – both feedback groups performed equally well during the acquisition phase of the
experiment. However, in a delayed transfer test of line drawing accuracy, the reduced feedback group outperformed the full feedback group.
Interestingly, our ERP data revealed that feedback on a reduced schedule elicited a larger feedback error-related negativity than on a full
schedule. Given recent theoretical accounts of the feedback error-related
negativity (i.e., Holroyd & Coles, 2002), our data suggest that the behavioral benefits of a reduced feedback schedule may result from increased
activation of a reinforcement learning system within medial-frontal cortex during skill acquisition.

Jeremy Gray7; 1Georgetown University, 2University of Pennsylvania, 3University
of Minnesota, 4Mount Sinai School of Medicine, 5UCLA, 6Vanderbilt University,
7Yale University — A central prediction of emerging cognitive neurogenetic research is that genetic effects on cognition are mediated by brain

144

function. However, while pair-wise correlations are now abundant, neural mediation has not been demonstrated. Here, in 160 genotyped fMRI
participants, we tested whether activity in four frontal brain regions statistically mediated the effect of COMT Val158Met genotype on cognitive
performance. We constructed a path-analytic gene-to-brain-to-cognition
model to predict performance on an executive attention task (MSIT) performed during fMRI, and an abbreviated full-scale IQ test performed
outside the scanner. The model included four mediator variables representing activity in four brain regions previously reported in brain-imaging of MSIT. Results indicated that brain activity in these regions during
MSIT executive conflict mediated the effect of COMT genotype on MSIT
performance and the effect of COMT genotype on IQ. This finding provides proof of concept for gene-to-brain-to-cognition path analysis to test
neural mediation, and informs the molecular-biological genesis of intelligent cognition.

THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY LEADING TO THE CORRECT RESPONSE:
ERP EVIDENCE FOR REACTIVE AND PROACTIVE COGNITIVE CONTROL

Daniela Czernochowski1; 1Heinrich-Heine University, Düsseldorf — A
longstanding debate surrounds the question how cognitive control is finetuned to flexibly meet changing task requirements. According to the
dual mechanisms of control framework (Braver et al., 2007), two alternate routes may lead to correct response selection when faced with
increased task demands. When response conflict is detected, reactive
control processes can be recruited immediately before the response.
However, this type of response selection will require additional time. If
advance preparation is feasible, control processes can be recruited proactively to allow for both rapid and correct response selection. In the
present investigation, informative or uninformative cues were presented
in a cued task-switch paradigm, making advance preparation either feasible or not. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to identify
dissociable neural correlates for both control processes. Following informative cues, participants responded about 300 ms faster relative to uninformative cues, suggesting that participants successfully recruited
proactive control. In the corresponding ERPs, a sustained (predominantly right-) frontal positivity was observed between 200-500 ms postcue onset following informative, but not uninformative cues. By contrast, accuracy was comparable across conditions, suggesting that reactive control processes were recruited successfully in the aid of accurate
performance at the expense of longer RTs following uninformative cues.
Starting around 200 ms prior to the response, the corresponding ERPs
revealed an additional (left-) frontal activity (pre-response negativity)
following uninformative relative to informative cues. Both components
and performance differences were evident only during mixed-task
blocks, consistent with the notion that control processes are recruited
selectively to meet higher task demands.

BEYOND THE FLANKER TASK: INTERFERENCE FROM INCENTIVIZED
DISTRACTERS, ANTICIPATED ACTION-EFFECTS, AND REFRESHED
REPRESENTATIONS Pareezad Zarolia3, Tiffany Jantz1, Jason Hubbard1,

Ezequiel Morsella1,2; 1San Francisco State University, 2University of California,
San Francisco, 3University of Denver — The classic flanker task has been
used to illuminate the behavioral, subjective, and neural aspects of different kinds of interference in action production. For example, ‘response
interference’ (RI; when distracters and targets indicate different
responses) leads to stronger behavioral and subjective effects than ‘perceptual interference’ (PI; when distracters look different from targets but
lead to the same response). RI is the condition that activates most the
anterior cingulate cortex (van Veen et al., 2001). We introduce three variants of the flanker task that extend these findings that, like previous variants, are amenable psychophysiological and neuroimaging technologies.
One variant (n = 21) yields flanker-like interference in a ‘response-effect
compatibility’ paradigm, where interference stems from anticipated
action-effects. In this variant, RI trials elicited longer response times
(RTs) than PI trials, F(1, 19) = 5.90, p < .05. Another variant (n = 28) exam-

ined interference involving ‘composite’ stimuli, which participants created by combining perceptual features of externally-presented stimuli
with ‘refreshed’ stimuli in working memory. RTs were greater for PI (M
= 1571.31, SEM = 86.21) than a condition in which targets and distracters
were identical (M = 1503.06, SEM =85.37). Extending the flanker task into
motivation-based interference, another variant (n = 41) employed distracters that were previously paired with incentivized stimuli that elicited approach tendencies (e.g., interesting images). Subjective measures
(e.g., ‘urges to err’) were lower for this ‘incentive interference’ than for
RI, t(81) = -3.07, p < .01. These successful variants were designed to be
integrated with the technologies of neuroscience.

Cebrian1,2, Daicia C. Allen1,2, Andrew S. Kayser1,2, Jennifer M. Mitchell1,2,
Howard L. Fields1,2; 1Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center, 2University of
California, San Francisco — Impulsivity is a known risk factor for sub-

stance use disorders, rendering its understanding and remediation a
high priority for vulnerable populations. Delay discounting tasks (DDT),
in which subjects are offered the choice between a smaller-sooner and a
larger-later reward, have been used to quantify impulsivity: more impulsive subjects tend to choose smaller-sooner rewards, reflected in higher
impulsive choice ratios (ICRs). Recently it has been shown that (1) a
greater ICR was correlated with greater blood-oxygen level dependent
(BOLD) activity in the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) and lesser BOLD
activity in the ventrolateral PFC, and (2) variation in the ICR was associated with variation in the Val-158-Met polymorphism in the catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT) gene, whose protein product degrades synaptically-released dopamine in PFC. Specifically, the Val-Val genotype,
linked to greater COMT activity and therefore to lower levels of prefrontal dopamine, was associated with greater ICR. These findings raise the
intriguing possibility that an inhibitor of COMT (tolcapone) may reduce
impulsive behavior. In the current study we attempted to confirm this
hypothesis via a functional MRI study in which subjects were screened
for COMT genotype and administered tolcapone or placebo in randomized, double-blind, counterbalanced fashion across two sessions as they
performed the DDT. Our preliminary results demonstrate significant
variability in ICR across subjects, are supportive of the previous BOLD
results in PFC, and suggest differences in previously implicated brain
regions, such as the parahippocampal gyri, across drug sessions. Ongoing work will further quantify these findings and link them to COMT
genotype.

IMPROVING THE DEFINITION OF MULTIPLE DEMAND CORTEX Ben

Crittenden1,2, Russell Thompson1, John Duncan1; 1Medical Research Council,
Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, 2University of Cambridge — Several discrete regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the parietal lobe have
been shown to be consistently and reliably activated by a wide variety of
executive tasks, regardless of the specific cognitive operations required
by each task. It is argued that these regions, termed multiple demand
(MD) cortex, flexibly adapt to code information that is relevant to ongoing behavior, thus playing a important role in guiding our behavior. Our
aim was to better classify which PFC and parietal regions are MD using
fMRI. We employed a mixed block/event-related design to identify
common regions of activation during the performance of a visual matching-to-sample task, an auditory discrimination task and a motor-dexterity task, each of which was presented in either an ‘easy’ or ‘hard’ form.
We found significant activations around the region of insula/frontal
operculum and intraparietal sulcus as well as robust activations of preSMA and inferior frontal sulcus, when compared to baseline, which was
consistent across all three tasks. Interestingly, while behavioral results
showed a successful difficulty manipulation, this effect was not present
in the imaging data. Previous studies have suggested that a simple perceptual difficulty contrast should provide a reliable MD activity pattern.
The current data, however, suggests that perceptual difficulty alone may

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

not be sufficient or sensitive enough to elicit strong MD activity. The
long-term aim of this work is the development of a short task that will
act as a functional localizer for defining the MD pattern in individual
subjects across experiments and labs.

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION OVER THE LEFT
PREFRONTAL CORTEX FACILITATES COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY IN TOOL
USE Evangelia G. Chrysikou1, Roy H. Hamilton1, H. Branch Coslett1, Sharon
L. Thompson-Schill1; 1University of Pennsylvania — The left ventrolateral pre-

frontal cortex has been implicated in higher-order cognitive tasks, in
which one has to exert cognitive control over available information to
achieve optimal performance (e.g., working memory, rule switching,
resolving interference from unwanted information). Recent neuroscience
evidence, however, has offered support for the hypothesis that certain
cognitive tasks may benefit from a tradeoff between brain regions
involved in rule-based processing (i.e., prefrontal cortex, PFC) and
regions involved in object processing, particularly of object attributes or
features (i.e., visual cortex). Guided by recent neuroimaging findings
from our lab, in the present study we explored the hypothesis that inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) will facilitate performance in a flexible use generation task. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of six conditions: they were shown pictures of common
artifacts and were asked to generate aloud either the object’s common
use (e.g., belt: to keep one’s pants up) or an uncommon use for it (e.g.,
belt: to use as a tourniquet), while receiving cathodal tDCS (1.5 mA)
either over the left PFC (F7 on the 10-20 system), or over the right PFC
(F8 on the 10-20 system), or sham stimulation. Participants were also
administered a control task (forward digit span). Analysis of voice-onset
reaction times showed facilitative effects of left PFC stimulation for the
uncommon, but not the common, use generation task. There were no
effects of stimulation on the control task. The results support the hypothesis that certain tasks may benefit from tradeoff between PFC and other
brain regions.

EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL VARIABILITY RELATED TO PERSONALITY
TRAITS ON A CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TASK Kazufumi
Omura1,

Eriko Suzuki1, Katsuhito Yamaguchi1, Kenji Kusumoto1; 1Yamagata
University — It is suggested that the amplitude and latency of the N2 and
P3 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) have been related to
several personality traits. In addition, behavioral inhibition (impulsivity)
in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is also
associated with these ERP components. This study evaluated how individual differences in N2 and P3 components on a continuous performance task (CPT) with the personality traits, including impulsiveness
measured by self-reported questionnaires. On a trial basis, ten healthy
participants completed self-reported impulsivity measure, Barratt
Impulsiveness Scale, version 11 (BIS-11), Behavioral Inhibition/Behavioral Activation Scales (BIS/BAS), and Temperament and Character
Inventory (TCI). Afterwards, they were asked to perform an AX-type
CPT with EEG recording. In the CPT, participants were instructed to
press a button as fast and accurate as possible, whenever the letter “X”
was preceded by the letter “O” (Go condition). For all other letters following the letter “O”, the prepared motor response had to be suppressed
(Nogo condition). The results showed the tendency that P3 amplitude in
the Nogo condition was positively correlated with the novelty seeking,
and was negatively correlated with impulsiveness. In contrast, the other
ratings of personal traits were not related to N2 and P3 amplitude in the
Nogo condition at this sample size. The results suggest the plausible
relationship between personality traits and N2 and P3 components.
Future research needs to increase number of participants for the detailed
investigation of this relationship and its strong statistical significance.

approach led to the identification of the Early Attentional Control Positivity (EACP), an anteriorly-distributed endogenous ERP component
elicited in response to stimuli in a to-be-ignored color, which we hypothesize orchestrates subsequent selective attention operations. Here, differences in this neural index of top-down control activity were examined
across individuals varying in executive function capacity (defined by
neuropsychological test performance). Executive capacity strongly predicted the size of the EACP and the level of performance on the task. The
EACP likely mediates the influence of executive capacity over RT performance, as the association disappeared after controlling for it. Consistent
with the hypothesized role of the EACP, its activity strongly predicted
the amplitude of the subsequent posterior selection negativity (SN), a
component believed to represent the modulation of sensory-perceptual
processing in extrastriate cortex based on stimulus feature relevance.
After accounting for the SN, the association between the EACP and task
performance also vanished. Our findings suggest that individual differences in executive capacity are tightly linked to the EACP, which
impacts performance on the experimental task through its controlling
influence over selective attention operations indexed by the SN.

EVIDENCE FOR DECOUPLING OF ATTENTION FROM PERCEPTUAL INPUT
DURING OFFLINE THOUGHT Kevin Brown1, Jonathan Smallwood1, Ben

Baird1, Joyce Sato-Reinhold1, Jonathan W Schooler1, Jean M Carlson1; 1UC
Santa Barbara — Accumulating evidence suggests that the mind is not

only proficient at processing external events but also adept at disengaging from the stream of sensory input to process internally generated
thoughts and feelings. This “offline” cognitive mode has been hypothesized to require both spontaneously generated mental activity and a
decoupling of attention from perception in order to separate competing
streams of internal and external information. Here, we use measurements of pupil diameter (PD) and surface electroencephalography (EEG)
to provide evidence for the role of decoupling during spontaneous cognitive activity. We employ two tasks that differed in the degree of online
processing for good task performance in order to focus particularly on
task periods: (i) conducive to offline thought, (ii) requiring external task
focus, (iii) prior to errors, or (iv) prior to slow behavioral responses. We
find spontaneous activity decoupled from task events during periods
conducive to offline thought, and (as expected) large task-evoked
changes during periods requiring task focus. We also find high levels of
spontaneous activity prior to task errors, as opposed to correct reponses.
Finally, high levels of spontaneous activity occurred prior to only the
slowest 20% of correct responses, suggesting a binary switch in cognitive
functioning. Taken together, these data are consistent with the decoupling hypothesis, which suggests that the capacity for spontaneous cognitive activity depends upon minimizing disruptions from the external
world.

NEURAL ACTIVATION DYNAMICS OF CONFLICT DETECTION AND

COGNITIVE CONTROL IN AN AUDITORY STROOP TASK Sarah
Donohue1, Mario Liotti2, Rick Perez III3, Marty G. Woldorff1; 1Duke University,
2Simon Fraser University, 3University of Texas Health Science Center at San
Antonio — The electrophysiological correlates of stimulus conflict pro-

cessing have been well characterized for the visual modality in paradigms such as the Stroop task and the Eriksen Flanker task. Much less is
known about conflict monitoring and associated cognitive control processes in response to conflicting auditory input. In the present study,
high-density electrical recordings of brain activity were obtained during
an auditory version of the Stroop task, using three modalities of
response (Overt verbal, Covert verbal and Manual) as we had done previously in the visual modality (Liotti et al., 2000). As expected, participants were less accurate and slower to respond to incongruent compared
to congruent trials. The evoked response to incongruent trials showed an
enhanced negative-polarity wave relative to congruent trials over superior scalp sites, similar to the N450 in the traditional visual Stroop task
but peaking about 100 ms earlier. In addition, this negative-polarity neural activity showed a response-related posterior shift in distribution,
from fronto-central for covert and overt verbal responses to more central-parietal for manual responses, also similar to the pattern seen in the
visual Stroop. The conflict-related negative wave was followed by an
enhanced posterior positivity for incongruent trials, similar to the late SP
reported for the visual Stroop task (500-800 ms post-stimulus). In addition, sequential effects were also observed that supported the conflictmonitoring and cognitive adjustment hypothesis. These data demonstrate that while the precise timing of conflict detection is very dependent on the modality of input, the general mechanisms appear to be
similar across modalities.

Executive Processes: Goal Maintenance &

F1
A BAYESIAN MODEL OF HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CONTROL DURING
TASK SWITCHING Francisco Barceló1, Xavier Porte1, Laura Prada1;

1University of the Balearic Islands, Palma de Mallorca, Spain — Modern mod-

els in Cognitive Neuroscience explain the behavioral and brain
responses obtained in task-switching paradigms through a variety of
mechanisms whose neurocognitive substrates are not well understood
yet. Few studies have attempted to model cognitive control in terms of
the probabilistic associations among task events using formal computational tools based on Information theory and Bayesian probability theory. In this study we employed a Bayesian model of surprise (Is) to
estimate the amount of information conveyed by sensory, motor and
sensorimotor representations in three different task contexts (Switch,
NoGo and Oddball), conveying identical visual information but distinct
response demands each. The model allowed us to explore trial-by-trial
changes in the amount of stimulus-response surprise over the course of
the experiment. The behavioral and brain responses measured in each
task supported the modeling work and resulted in three distinct information processing profiles, which can be summarized into two major
properties. First, there was greater variability in trial-by-trial surprise
during the initial 100 trials of each task compared to the remaining trials
in the block. Second, contextually informative cues that did not demand
any overt response actually conveyed a larger amount of surprise than
to-be-responded targets. The modeling of sensorimotor –rather than
only sensory or only motor– representations achieved the best fit with
the reaction times and other brain indicators of cognitive control. These
analyses suggest that task-switching performance could be accounted
for through probabilistic sensorimotor associations among stimulus and
response representations. Supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Innovación y Ciencia (PSI2010-17419/PSIC).

environments we need to dynamically re-organize our behavior in order
to reach desired goals. This requires strategic switches between different
tasks. However, little is known about the neural basis of such adaptation
processes. We developed a novel, motivated choice paradigm and used
multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data (MVPA) to investigate this.
Subjects chose between three different tasks on a trial-by-trial basis. Task
difficulty varied independently for all three tasks, increasing for the chosen task set and decreasing for the non-chosen task sets. This created an

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

exploration-exploitation dilemma for which subjects needed to find a
solution. To keep difficulty and error rates low, they had to produce a
motivated decision on which task to perform next, based on their estimation of the changing environmental variables. Using MVPA, we were
able to predict subjects’ choices from medial PFC, and parietal cortex.
Furthermore, we could predict the current difficulty level – the motivational factor driving choices – from reward related areas. Interestingly,
the ventro-medial PFC (vmPFC) encoded both the choices and the difficulty. This area was previously associated with the processing of stimulus-values. Our results suggest that vmPFC is also involved in encoding
motivated choices. Further planned analyses will investigate the interaction between areas encoding choices and areas encoding motivational
factors in more detail. This should provide important clues on how
humans endogenously adapt their behavior to cope with changing environments.

THE EFFECTS OF CONTEXT, EPISODIC AND STIMULUS-RESPONSE
COMPATIBILITY DEMANDS ON EXECUTIVE PROCESSING IN THE YOUNG
AND ELDERLY Brian C. Rakitin1, Yaakov Stern1; 1Columbia University —
Twenty-two healthy elderly (age = 65 ± 5.5) and twenty healthy young
(age = 26 ± 6.8) participated in a version of Etienne Koechlin’s test of
executive function. This task combines contextual demands (i.e. single
task versus task-switching conditions) with episodic demands (i.e. the
number of conditions indicated by a color cue across all task conditions
within participants) to vary executive function difficulty and drive prefrontal cortex. As anticipated, both speed and accuracy was impaired in
dual-task conditions relative to single task conditions, in high episodic
demand conditions versus low-episodic demand conditions, and all
effect were proportionately larger in the elderly compared to young participants. An unexpected effect was the disproportionate impairment in
the elderly participants when a stimulus indicated two different
responses in the two different tasks. That is stimulus-response incompatibility was a major determinant of accuracy and RT in the elderly. This
finding is not predicted by, nor is it commensurate with the information
theory framework put forward by Koechlin to provide a common metric
of difficulty for different aspects of executive function and to explain
shifts in neural support along the lateral frontal axis in response to executive demands.

actions and outcome values and to flexibility adapt our current intentions to external contingencies is fundamentally engaged in human decision-making. Recent fMRI studies based on models of reinforcement

regions (amPFC). However, these studies focused on learning single
actions. Little is known whether similar mechanisms operate for value-

based learning and deciding between superordinate task-sets, which we
investigated in this study. Furthermore we want to elucidate the functional specificity of distinct brain regions in such a learning mechanisms.
Subjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging
while choosing freely between two tasks respectively two motor
responses, which where differently and variably rewarded in a stochastic manner. Using an extended reinforcement-learning model, we show
that frontopolar regions only track the value of the unchosen task, but
not the unchosen motor response, whereas activity in dorsal ACC correlates with both unchosen values. Furthermore amPFC integrates the
value of the chosen task and motor response. At a glance, these findings
provide new insights into prefrontal neural circuits responding distinctly to reward expectations.

SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF LOW FREQUENCY BOLD
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEFAULT NETWORK MAY PREDICT
Schwarb1,
PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE TASK PERFORMANCE Hillary

Garth Thompson1, Waqaas Majeed1, Andy McKinley2, Michael D. Merritt1, Eric
H. Schumacher1, Shella D. Keilholz1; 1Georgia Institute of Psychology, 2Air
Force Research Laboratory — In recent years, researchers have begun mapping functional connectivity in the resting brain by identifying spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent
(BOLD) signal. Using this technique, researchers have identified many
brain networks. Two such networks often associated with attention are
the “default mode” and “task-positive” networks. Standard techniques
measure activity in these networks across scans. However, it is possible
that a wealth of information exists in the dynamic fluctuations of the
BOLD signal which are not measured with current analysis techniques.
In this study, high temporal resolution functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) data were collected from human subjects performing a
psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). A novel pattern finding algorithm
was developed and applied to examine the spatiotemporal patterns in
BOLD fluctuations. The most common pattern detected was an alternation between those areas associated with the default mode network (e.g.,
posterior cingulate and anterior medial prefrontal cortices) and those
associated with the task-positive network (e.g., superior parietal and
premotor cortices). Differences in the signal between default mode and
task positive mode activations surrounding PVT task onset were then
identified. Preliminary results indicate that successful PVT performance
was associated with an anti-correlation between the two modes while
failure on the PVT task was associated with correlated mode signals.
These data indicate that patterns of relative dominance in the BOLD signal of the default mode network may predict performance on attentional
tasks.

THE NEURAL BASIS OF TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP INFLUENCES IN
VOLUNTARY TASK CHOICE Jelle Demanet1, Wouter De Baene1, Catherine

M. Arrington2, Marcel Brass1; 1Ghent University, 2Lehigh University — The
present fMRI study investigates the neural correlates of top-down and
bottom-up influences on voluntary task choice. Recent studies have
shown that voluntary task choice is biased by elements in the environment. The likelihood to choose a specific task in a given trial depends for
example on whether the stimulus has been associated with the same or a
different task in a preceding learning phase (Arrington et al., 2010;
Demanet et al., 2010). In the present study we used such bottom-up
influences on task choice to manipulate the degree of intentional
involvement in task selection. We argue that trials in which the task
choice is primed by the stimulus are less intentional than trials where
participants overrule the stimulus bias to select a task. This assumption
was supported by the finding that participants, during mind wandering
episodes, were biased more often by a stimulus in their task choice. The
brain imaging data revealed that a top-down driven (unbiased) task
choice was related to activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior
frontal gyrus, anterior insular cortex and intra-parietal sulcus, areas that

148

all can be related to intentional choice and cognitive control. A bottomup driven (biased) task choice led to stronger activity in the posterior
cingulate cortex, the precuneus, the angular gyrus and the medial prefrontal cortex. These areas are typically considered as part of the default
network (e.g. Mason et al., 2007). Our results reveal how brain activation
related to the free selection of task sets is affected by bottom-up influences.

EFFECTS OF HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES ON TASK SWITCHING

Sebastian Ocklenburg1, Onur Gunturkun1, Christian Beste1; 1Ruhr University
Bochum — Functional hemispheric asymmetries have been observed in
different cognitive domains, but it is still largely unclear how they modulate the efficacy of specific executive functions. In the present study, we
used a lateralized version of the task switching paradigm to investigate
the relevance of hemispheric asymmetries for cognitive flexibility.
Words were tachistoscopically presented in the left (LVF) and right
visual half field (RVF) and participants had to perform one out of two
discrete tasks on each trial: In first task, participants had to categorize the
words based on their initial letters, whereas in the second task the words
had to be categorized according to their word class. On half of the trials
the task changed (change trials) whereas on the other half it stayed the
same (repeat trials). ERPs were recorded using a 64-channel EEG, and
the neural sources of the ERPs were reconstructed using standardized
low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). On the
behavioral level, we observed an interaction between task type and
visual field. In the initial letter task, switch costs were higher for LVF trials than for RVF trials, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in the
word class task. On the electrophysiological level, we observed visual
half-field dependent differences in the amplitude of the P3. For both
tasks, stimulus presentation in the LVF induced a weaker P3 compared
to presentation in the RVF. In conclusion the results suggest that modulating influences of hemispheric asymmetries should be taken into
account when examining executive functions.

BETTER TASK-SWITCHING PERFORMANCE IN EXPERT VIDEO GAME
PLAYERS: SUPERIOR PREPARATION? Meredith Minear1, Mark Thacker1;

1The College of Idaho — Recent studies have reported improved performance on several attention tasks by experienced video game players
(VGPs) compared to non-gamers (NVGPs). There has been growing
research into whether VGPs are also superior on measures of executive
function. Several studies have examined differences in task-switching
performance, one putative executive function, with mixed results. Taskswitching itself is thought to consist of several different processes, some
executive and others not. These processes can be teased apart by manipulating different variables such as the extent to which a switch is predictable, the degree of task overlap between stimuli and response sets and
the amount of time to prepare for a switch. Previous studies of expert
VGPs have used different types of switching paradigms making comparisons across studies difficult. The goal of the present study was to systematically manipulate the type of switch as well as the amount of time
given to prepare for a switch in order to better understand whether
VGPs do show better switching performance than NVGPs and why. We
compared the switching performance of experienced VGPs (individuals
who reported playing first person shooter and real time strategy games
at least 10 hours a week for at least 2 years) to NVGPs. We found that
while VGPs had smaller switch costs in most conditions, their performance did not differ from NVGPs when there was no opportunity to
prepare for a switch. This suggests that superior switching performance
in VGPs may be due to strategic or motivational differences in preparation.

University Maryland, 5UC Davis School of Medicine — Motor planning is a
fundamental component of motor behavior that is disrupted in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Movements can be internally generated (IG) or externally cued (EQ), and motor deficits in PD are typically linked to IG
movements. However, treatment has focused primarily on motor execution. We evaluated the efficacy of neurocognitive rehabilitation to
improve performance of IG movement initiation in PD. PD and control
subjects performed a PC-based adaptive training paradigm. Trials consisted of typing a response to a visually presented sequence of 1-4 digits
(EQ movement) then reproducing the sequence in response to an uninformative cue (IG movement). A 5:1 adaptive staircase with per-trial performance of 87% correct was used over 12 days of training with a fixed
length pre- and post-test. Subjects also completed neuropsychological
measures of cognitive flexibility and measures of timed instrumental
activities of daily living (TIADLs). PD participants were assigned to a
group who benefited from training and a group who did not. All groups
showed decreased RT after training, and improvement was similar
across groups for cued responses. However, the PD improvement group
showed significantly greater reduction in RT and error rate, as expected
based on group formation criteria. Specific measures of cognitive flexibility (Switch time Trails B) and TIADLs (change making subscore) predicted improved performance. Results suggest that cognitive
rehabilitation can be used to improve movement initiation in PD, and a
neuropsychological test battery can be used to identify candidates for
training.

TOWARDS NEURAL NETWORK MODELS LINKING GENETICS TO
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS Seth
Herd1,
Naomi Friedman1, Christopher Chatham1, Thomas Hazy1, Angela Brant1,
Randall O'Reilly1; 1University of Colorado — We report preliminary results

of a project that seeks to provide mechanistic explanations linking genetics to cognition through detailed models of brain function. We have created neural network models that learn an array of executive function
tasks that have previously been used to derive components of executive
function based on individual differences (Friedman et al., 2008). The
models use the Prefrontal cortex Basal ganglia Working Memory
(PBWM) framework (Hazy, Frank, & O'Reilly 2006) and extend it to task
control. This framework proposes learning mechanisms in the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) and basal ganglia (BG) consistent with extensive low-level
biological data. Changes in key parameters of these models sensibly correspond to two of the three components of executive function found in
empirical work: updating working memory, and switching task sets.
Changes in parameters in the basal ganglia affect learning when to store
information in PFC, and therefore the updating component, while
parameters affecting the tendency of PFC neurons to automatically
retain information negatively affect the switching component. Some of
these parameters correspond to genetic variation related to dopamine
receptors in striatum and PFC. This preliminary testing represents a
small subset of the predictions and tests of theory that can be performed
with these models. These models offer a rich explanatory framework
that links low and high level data through the intermediate level
addressed by cognitive neuroscience. As such, this new approach may
bypass some of the problems (e.g., massive multiple comparisons) inherent in a purely empirical mapping between genetics and cognition.

pants were shown a display with two symbols each of which was a letter, a number or a non-alphanumeric symbol and were asked to make a
consonant/vowel or an odd/even judgment. The judgment type or task
was cued by the color of the stimuli. Switching was event-related, unpredictable and self-paced. There were blocks of crosstalk and neutral
switching trials. Overall participants spent more time performing
crosstalk trials compared to neutral trials in addition to reliable overall
switching costs. Dorsolateral prefrontal regions were found to respond
to crosstalk and this response was larger when there was task switching
implicating interference resolution and or inhibition. Left lateral frontopolar cortex was responsive to task switching with and without
crosstalk. Overall, more time was spent performing crosstalk trials than
neutral trials and to investigate the role of time on task, switch costs
were entered into a second level random effects analysis as a covariate.
This analysis did not degrade the dissociation between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar cortex observed in the previous analysis.

SUCCUMBING TO BOTTOM-UP BIASES DURING VOLUNTARY TASK
CHOICE PREDICTS INCREASED SWITCH COSTS Joseph M. Orr1, Sean E.

Masters1, Daniel H. Weissman1; 1University of Michigan — Bottom-up biases

are widely thought to influence task choice in the voluntary task switching paradigm. Definitive support for this hypothesis is lacking, however,
because task choice and task performance are usually confounded. We
therefore revisited this hypothesis using a task switching paradigm in
which task choice and task performance were registered at different
times in each trial. Fifty-four healthy undergraduates participated in the
study. In the choice phase of each trial, they were (a) explicitly cued to
choose one of two possible tasks or (b) prompted by a question mark to
randomly choose a task. Critically, each question mark was flanked by
an irrelevant stimulus that often served as a cue to perform a specific
task in other trials. As predicted, participants tended to choose the task
primed by the irrelevant stimulus. Moreover, such choices were linked
to increased switch costs during subsequent task performance. These
findings provide compelling evidence that bottom-up biases influence
voluntary task choice. They also suggest that succumbing to such biases
reflects a reduction of top-down control that persists to influence upcoming task performance.

THE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO SHIFTING REWARD CONTINGENCIES IS

DISORDER Edward Patzelt1,2, Kelvin Lim1,2, Nancy Raymond1, Sheila

Specker1, Angus MacDonald III1,2; 1University of Minnesota, 2VA Medical
Center — Impulsive disorders such as cocaine addiction, and perhaps

binge eating disorder, have been associated with maladaptive behaviors
that continue despite increasingly deleterious consequences. However,
the underlying mechanism of an inability to learn as a result of negative
reinforcement remains unclear because of the psychopharmacological
effects of cocaine. Using a probabilistic reversal learning task we investigated the ability of binge eating disordered participants (n=25), normal
weight controls (n=22), overweight controls (n=24), cocaine users (n=37),
and non-using controls (n=37) to adapt to changing reward contingencies. Participants performed a reversal learning task in which they
choose between two stimuli, receiving feedback as to the whether their
choice was “correct” or “incorrect”. During 20% of the trials participants
received false feedback indicating their choice was incorrect when it was
actually correct. Following 10 consecutive correct responses the patterns
(and corresponding feedback) reversed. Data were analyzed using a
repeated measures mixed effects hierarchical linear model for each disorder (binge eating & cocaine addiction). In the cocaine group there was
a significant interaction between group membership and reversal when
comparing the sum of trials to obtain the 1st reversal vs subsequent
reversals. This pattern was not observed in the binge eating group, suggesting a possible difference in the mechanism underlying the two disorders, potentially mediated by the pharmacological effect of cocaine use.
These findings imply that the nature of impulsivity in cocaine addiction

149

may correspond to a failure to integrate reward feedback, whereas this
mechanism does not characterize the impulsivity associated with binge

INVESTIGATING CUE-RELATED BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING TASKSWITCHING Andrea Weinstein1, Rachel Milgrom1, Marlena Casey1, Destiny

Miller1, Sarah Banducci1, Stephanie Akl1, Kirk Erickson1; 1University of
Pittsburgh — The ability to rapidly switch between multiple tasks

decreases with age, prompting research on attenuating losses in switching ability. In this fMRI-based pilot study, we examined the effect of cueing during a task switching paradigm on 19 healthy, young adults (Mean
age = 24.60 years; SD = 3.30 years). We employed an event-related paradigm in which repeat and switch trials were presented pseudo-randomly. During each trial, a letter was presented surrounded by a box
with a cue indicating the task to perform. The two tasks were a consonant/vowel judgment (marked by a red CV) and an uppercase/lowercase judgment (marked by a blue UL). Cues appeared simultaneously
with or prior to (2000 or 4000 ms) stimulus onset. We predicted that cueing the task before stimulus onset would reduce switch costs and reduce
brain activity in prefrontal and parietal regions associated with taskswitching. Further, we hypothesized that cue-related brain activity
would predict decreases in activity during switching. Consistent with
our predictions, we found that performance during switch trials were
slower than repeat trials (t = 8.607; p < .001). Importantly, cueing successfully reduced switch costs by 52.70 ms (t = -2.520; p = .022). Additionally, brain activity during switching was reduced after cue
presentation in several regions, including precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex. Our results indicate that cues and associated brain activity
predict subsequent decreased cortical resource allocation during taskswitching. Future analyses will include data from healthy and impaired
older adults to investigate whether cueing can reduce switch costs in
these populations.

IMPAIRED TASK SWITCHING IS RELATED TO WORKING MEMORY ABILITY
AND INHIBITORY CONTROL IN CHILDREN WITH ADHD Natasha

Matthews1, Kelly Garner1, Joe Wagner1, Emma Collier-Baker1, Alasdair Vance2,
Mark. A Bellgrove1; 1University of Queensland, 2University of Melbourne —
This study investigated the relationship between task switching performance and both working memory ability and inhibitory control in children with attention-deficit-hyperactitivy-disorder (ADHD). Thirty-five
children with ADHD and 30 aged-matched control children performed a
task-switching task in which they alternated between judging the colour
or the shape of a target stimulus. Both children with ADHD and control
participants displayed the predicted task-switching cost, with longer
reaction times and great error rates on trials that required switching
between the colour- and shape-tasks relative to trials in which tasks were
repeated. The switch costs were greater for children with ADHD compared with controls. Post error slowing (calculated as the mean of reaction time following an error response minus mean reaction time
following a correct response) did not differ between groups. Successful
task switching ability requires both the maintenance of the current task
set in working memory and the inhibition of previous task sets. To
explore the relationship between these two processes and switching performance we correlated switch costs with performance on a 2-back spatial working memory task and a stop signal inhibition task. Both
working memory accuracy and stop signal reaction time were correlated
with task switching performance in children with ADHD, but not in control children. The present results provide further evidence for impaired
task switching performance in ADHD and suggest that this impairment
may be closely related to underlying impairments in working memory
and inhibition.

STRATEGIC ORIENTATION OF ATTENTION REDUCES TEMPORALLY
PREDICTABLE STIMULUS CONFLICT Lawrence Appelbaum1, Carsten

Boehler1, Robert Won1, Lauren Davis1, Marty Woldorff1; 1Duke University —
Humans are able to continuously monitor environmental situations and
adjust their behavioral strategies to optimize performance. Here we
investigate the behavioral and brain adjustments that occur when conflicting stimulus elements are, or are not, temporally predictable. Eventrelated potentials (ERPs) were collected while two different variants of
the color-naming Stroop task were performed in which the stimulus
onset asynchronies (SOAs) between the relevant color and irrelevant
word stimulus components were varied, with the SOAs (-200ms, -100ms,
0ms/simultaneous, 100ms, 200ms) being either randomly intermixed or
held constant within each experimental run. Results indicated that the
size of both the neural and behavioral effects of stimulus incongruency
varied with the temporal arrangement of the stimulus components, such
that the random-SOA arrangements produced the greatest incongruency
effects at the earliest irrelevant-dimension first SOA (-200 ms) and the
constant-SOA arrangements produced the greatest effects with simultaneous presentation. These differences in conflict processing were accompanied by rapid (~150 ms) modulations of the sensory evoked
components of the irrelevant distracter components when they consistently occurred first. These effects suggest that individuals are able to
strategically allocate attention in time to mitigate interference of a temporally predictable distracter. In that these adjustments were instantiated by the subjects without instruction, they reveal a form of rapid
strategic learning for facilitating performance when there is temporally
predictable stimulus incongruency.

THE EVENT-RELATED OPTICAL SIGNAL (EROS) REVEALS COMMON AND
TASK-SPECIFIC MECHANISMS OF RESPONSE MODE PREPARATION
Pauline Baniqued1, Kathy Low1, Monica Fabiani1, Gabriele Gratton1;
1
Beckman Institute and Psychology Department, University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign — Redirecting attention from previously relevant

tasks to deal with new demands is an important everyday skill. Whereas
previous studies show the importance of fronto-parietal regions in controlling attention, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of
this network. Using the event-related optical signal (EROS), we investigate activity related to task-switching in networks of brain regions.
EROS measures changes in optical scattering due to activity in neural tissue and offers good spatial and temporal resolution. We manipulated
the response mode on each trial in a choice-response task. Subjects
received an auditory-visual precue indicating whether to respond
vocally or manually. After 2000 ms, participants saw or heard an “L” or
“R”, indicating a “left” or “right” response to be implemented with the
appropriate response modality. There were no reliable switch costs for
reaction time or accuracy, although vocal responses were slower overall
than manual responses. Consistent with previous findings, we found
common task-switching activity in fronto-parietal regions beginning
around 200 ms post-precue. We also found prolonged task-specific
effects in the final second before the reaction stimulus, where switching
to a vocal response mode showed activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and switching to manual elicited a response in more ventral parietaloccipital regions. Concurrently recorded ERPs show a similar pattern
reversal at the Pz electrode during the later preparatory period. Switching to manual was associated with greater negativity, and switching to
vocal was associated with greater positivity. These results expand on

VARIATIONS IN DISCOUNT RATES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES
IN THE ABILITY TO IMAGINE FUTURE REWARDS Shabnam Hakimi1, Todd

Hare1, Antonio Rangel1; 1Caltech — Behavioral studies have shown that
there is considerable variation across individuals on their ability to postpone gratification in order to obtain larger delayed rewards. It has been
hypothesized that some of this variation might be due to differences on
the ability to represent the value of future rewards. We tested this
hypothesis using human functional neuroimaging while participants
performed two different tasks: an intertemporal monetary choice (ITC)
task where they made binary choices between a small immediate
amount of money and larger delayed payments, and a visualization task
in which they consumed or imagined consuming appetitive liquid
rewards. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the subjective
value of the monetary offers was encoded in ventral medial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC) during the ITC task. We also found a common area of
left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) that exhibited a pattern of
activity consistent with the main hypothesis. During ITC, this region
exhibited stronger activation in more difficult trials (where there is a
conflict between the immediate and delayed values of the rewards), as
well as increased functional connectivity with the area of vmPFC
involved in valuation. During the visualization task, the same region
showed stronger activation during imagining than consumption trials,
and it also exhibited increased functional connectivity with vmPFC.
Moreover, more patient participants exhibited enhanced responses in
vmPFC during the imagination component of the visualization task.
Together, these data suggest that the left vlPFC plays a critical role in
computing the value of delayed rewards during decision-making.

FURTHER EVIDENCE OF A DISSOCIATION BETWEEN ACTION PREVENTION
AND CANCELLATION Chelan Weaver1,2, Courtney Clark3, Michael C.

Anderson2; 1Cambridge University, 2MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,

3University of California, Los Angeles — The

ability to stop prepotent motor
responses is widely thought to rely on inhibitory control. Two of the
most commonly used motor-stopping tasks are the stop-signal and go/
no-go paradigms. These are similar but distinct tasks that have been
used extensively (and often interchangeably), to measure the ability to
stop movements across many and varied populations. Although both
tasks quantify aspects of stopping performance, there is increasing doubt
that they share common computational processes or neural substrates.
Further, it has not previously been shown that either task necessitates
inhibitory control as narrowly defined by cognitive psychologists, in
which stopping is accomplished by attenuating the response itself. To
ascertain the involvement of inhibition in these paradigms, each task
was adapted to incorporate the independent probe method, a technique
developed to isolate the after-effects of inhibition from other sources of
memory impairment. In the current work, novel stimuli were used to
elicit recently-stopped motor responses, enabling the measurement of
performance decrements localized to responses. This revealed a dissociation between two types of motor stopping. Across a series of betweensubject and within-subject experiments, robust after-effects of inhibition
were found in the adapted stop-signal task, but no evidence of inhibition
was found in the adapted go/no-go task. This suggests that inhibitory
control is recruited for cancelling actions, but might not be utilized to
prevent movements.

SPATIO-TEMPORAL BRAIN DYNAMICS MEDIATING POST-ERROR

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Lausanne, 3Cibm, Lausanne, Switzerland, 4Vanderbilt University Medical
Center, Nashville, TN — Optimal behavior relies on rapid and flexible
adaptation to environmental requirements, notably based on the detection of errors. The impact of error-detection on subsequent behavior typically manifests as a slowing down of response time following errors.
This effect has been attributed to shifts to more cautious response mode
or to distraction induced by the infrequent error trials. However, how
errors impact the processing of subsequent stimuli and in turn shapes
behavior remains unresolved. To address these questions, we used a
speeded auditory spatial Go/NoGo task and contrasted auditory evoked
potentials (AEPs) to left-lateralized "Go" and right "NoGo" stimuli as a
function of performance on the preceding Go stimuli, generating a 2x2
design with “Preceding Performance” (accurate; inaccurate) and Stimulus type (Go; NoGo) as within-subjects factors. Behaviorally, we replicated post-error slowing effects. Electrophysiologically, AEPs
modulated topographically as a function of preceding performance 80110ms post-stimulus onset and then as a function of stimulus type 110140ms, indicative of changes in the underlying brain networks. Source
estimations of these effects revealed a stronger activity of prefrontal
regions to stimuli after successful than error trials, followed by a stronger response of parietal areas to the NoGo than Go stimulus. We interpret these results in terms of a shift from a fast-automatic to a slowcontrolled form of inhibitory control induced by the detection of errors,
manifesting during low-level integration of subsequent stimuli, which in
turn influences response speed.

WHEN THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER AGENT ALTERS MY OWN ACTION: AN
ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC STUDY OF THE SOCIAL SIMON EFFECT Karen

Davranche1, Pascal Huguet1, Clément Belletier1,2, Boris Burle1, Franck Vidal1,
Thierry Hasbroucq1; 1Université de Provence et CNRS, Marseille, France,
2Direction Générale de l’Armement — The purpose of this study was to
investigate whether sharing a task with another agent alters our own
cognitive performances. We combined reaction time (RT) methods and
electromyographic (EMG) recordings to assess the nature of information
processing implemented by each co-actor. Sixteen participants performed an individual Simon task and a Go/Nogo task completed alone
and alongside with a friend. In the joint Go/Nogo task, each participant
was responsible to only one response (left or right hand) associated to
the colour of the stimulus (red or green). Each actor can be seen as performing a Go/Nogo task, or from another point of view, that the pair
performed a Simon task. In the individual Simon task, RT was shorter
when spatial locations of stimulus and response corresponded than
when they did not correspond (+29ms). An analogous interference effect,
albeit of smaller magnitude, was observed both in the individual Go/
Nogo task and in the joint Go/Nogo task. Importantly, the effect was
smaller in the former (+6ms) than in the latter task condition (+11ms).
This suggests that co-acting alters the nature and number of operations
of information processing. Nevertheless, analysis of EMG patterns
reveals that the motor component of cognitive processes implemented
by each co-actor differs from those implemented in the individual Simon
task. In particular, the number of incorrect EMG activations was unaffected by the correspondence between the stimulus and response locations. The results further show that co-acting with another agent speeds
up response execution.

INFORMATION-BASED BRAIN MAPPING OF STIMULUS- VERSUS
RESPONSE-BASED INTERFERENCE CONTROL PROCESSES Tobias

Egner1, Jiefeng Jiang1; 1Duke University — Interference control, the resolution of conflict from task-irrelevant stimuli in the selection of goaldirected responses, is held to be a key executive function. A basic distinction can be drawn between two major forms of conflict: stimulus-based
conflict interferes with response selection as a consequence of perceptual
ambiguity in the imperative stimulus (e.g., in a manual Stroop task),
whereas response-based conflict interferes with response selection via a

151

Poster Session F — Monday, April 4, 1:00 - 3:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
response-affordance of a task-irrelevant stimulus attribute (e.g. in the
Simon task). It is currently debated whether the resolution of these different conflicts is served by domain-general or domain-specific mechanisms. To address this question, we conducted an fMRI study (n = 21)
that orthogonally combined stimulus- (Stroop) and response-based
(Simon) conflicts in a face-gender discrimination task. Behavioral results
documented additive costs of these conflicts. We analyzed the fMRI data
with information-based pattern analysis techniques. Specifically, using a
recursive voxel selection/elimination scheme, we trained one classifier
to distinguish between congruent and incongruent Simon features, and
another classifier to distinguish between congruent and incongruent
Stroop features. Cross-validation analysis showed that the classifiers
achieved ~75% performance accuracy. Preliminary additional analyses
suggest that the Stroop classifier performs poorly at predicting Simon
congruency, and vice versa. Furthermore, the two classifiers draw on
distinct sets of voxels, with the Simon classifier relying predominantly
on voxels in premotor cortex, and the Stroop classifier on voxels in visual
cortex, including the fusiform face area. These preliminary results support the assumption of a modular (domain-specific) organization of
interference control processes.

F23
NEURAL MECHANISMS OF CONTEXT-SPECIFIC COGNITIVE CONTROL
Joseph A. King1, Franziska M. Korb1, Tobias Egner1; 1Duke University — Recent

behavioral research has shown improved interference resolution for
stimuli in contexts (e.g. locations) associated with a high proportion of
incongruent items and vice versa-even though subjects are unaware of
conflict frequency manipulations. These findings suggest that contextual
cues trigger an online retrieval of attentional control associated with that
context (“priming of control”). An alternative possibility is that the effect
is mediated by sustained attention to the context with higher probability
of conflict. Here, we employed event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to adjudicate between these two possibilities. We
manipulated the proportion of incongruent-to-congruent trials presented in each visual hemifield in a face-gaze version of the Eriksen
flanker task (n = 27). Crucially, we used only trial-unique stimuli and
thus controlled for possible influences of lower-level associative mechanisms. Nevertheless, participants showed a robust context-specific adaptation effect with reduced interference at the high-conflict location. Our
fMRI analyses focus on activation in the fusiform face area (FFA), which
we defined with an independent localizer scan. Specifically, activity in
the left/right FFA are analyzed as a function of whether the stimulus on
a given trial was in the ipsi- or contra-lateral hemifield, and whether the
contra-lateral field was the low or high conflict location. The sustained
attention account predicts generally enhanced FFA activation contra-lateral to the high-conflict hemifield, whereas the priming-of-control
account predicts enhanced FFA activity only when a stimulus is present
in contra-lateral, high-conflict field. Preliminary results uncovered a
hemifield by context interaction in the FFA, concordant with the priming-of-control account.

IS IMITATION RELATED TO THE ACTIVATION OF THE MOTOR CORTICES
DURING ACTION OBSERVATION? Elena Núñez Castellar1, Clémence

Roger1, Wim Fias1; 1Ghent University, Belgium — Recent research has shown

that during action observation activity in the motor cortices is influenced
by the observed action. Observer’s lateralized activity in motor cortices
is thought to reflect what the observer would have done if he/she had
actively done the task him/herself (Van Schie et al., 2004) consistent with
studies of imitation. In the present study we further investigated this lateralization during action observation. EEG was recorded when participants executed and observed other participant‘s performance in a
flanker task. Opposite to previous studies, the other’s actions were not
monitored by observing the other’s hand movements but instead a red
light indicated the side in which the other participant’s response was
given. The data were analyzed using Laplacian transform (Babiloni et al.,
2001), which improves the spatial and temporal resolution of the EEG.

152

Our results showed that even in the absence of hand-movement observation, there was lateralized activity maximal over the observer’s premotor
cortex. We did not find this activity maximal over the motor cortices. The
finding of lateralized activity in the pre-motor areas when the motor acts
cannot be observed put in doubt the idea that increased activity at the
motor level is related with imitation, which can be defined as the copying of body movements that we observe (Brass & Heyes, 2005). Instead,
we hypothesize that the lateralized activity is driven by the representation of the other’s expected response.

F25
AROUSAL IN COGNITIVE CONTROL Marlies van Bochove1, Lise Van der

Hagen1, Wim Notebaert1, Tom Verguts1; 1Ghent University — Emotional stim-

uli lead to enhanced processing and subsequent improved memory (e.g.,
McGaugh, 1990). Verguts and Notebaert (2009) proposed that a similar
process is responsible for increased cognitive control in congruency
tasks after incongruent stimuli. For example, after an incongruent
flanker trial, it is assumed that an arousal signal is sent throughout the
cortex which strengthens active task-relevant associations. This arousalinduced learning leads to a reduced congruency effect on the next trial
(i.e., Gratton effect). The current study therefore investigated arousal in
the flanker by measuring pupil dilation, an index of arousal (possibly
related to LC activation (Jepma & Nieuwenhuis, in press)). We asked
participants (N = 13) to perform a flanker task and collected both reaction times and pupil width. We found that pupil width is larger during
incongruent than congruent trials. This is consistent with the hypothesis
that conflict leads to arousal and more generally, in line with the hypothesis that learning might play a key role in cognitive control (Verguts &
Notebaert, 2009).

F26
ERRORS: DID SOMETHING GO WRONG IN THE MOTOR COMMAND?
Clémence Roger1, Elena Núñez Castellar1, Wim Fias1; 1Ghent University,
Belgium — We often advise children not being impulsive otherwise they

might end up making an error. Indeed the reaction times (RT) in errors
are shorter than in correct trials. Peripheral indices, like EMG activity,
showed that even if the erroneous command has been sent there is an online tentative to overtake it. However, no evidence of these mechanisms
has been observed at the cortical level so far. In the present study we
investigated the differences between the organization of the motor command in error and correct trials. For that purpose, participants performed a flanker task and the EEG and EMG was recorded. We
compared our results with the ones of previous studies which have
shown that during correct responses in between hand RT tasks, the
motor command is organized in a way that the effecter involved in the
selected response is activated (negativity over contralateral M1) whereas
the effecter involved in the non-selected response is inhibited (positivity
over ipsilateral M1) (Vidal et al., 2003). Such an inhibition has been interpreted as an error prevention mechanism. First, our results showed that
the contralateral activation of the selected response is reduced in errors
suggesting an on-line inhibition of the erroneous response activation at
the M1 level. Second, we found that the ipsilateral inhibition of the alternative response was absent in errors. Because in correct trials the nondesired action is inhibited, we interpreted the absence of inhibition in
errors as reflecting impulsivity at the response selection stage.

BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL CORRELATES OF COGNITIVE CONTROL

Millner1, Diego Pizzagalli2; 1Harvard University, 2McLean Hospital, Harvard

depressive disorder (MDD) display impaired performance in cognitive
control tasks (e.g., Stroop task) and dysfunctions within frontocingulate
pathways. Preliminary research suggests that training MDD individuals
on tasks that target abnormally functioning brain regions could have
therapeutic effects. As a first step in this direction, the current study
tested healthy individuals in a 3-day training program aimed at enhanc-

ing cognitive control function. The long-term goal of this research is to
evaluate whether cognitive training probing executive functions and
underlying frontocingulate pathways could enhance treatment response
for MDD patients. Twenty-two healthy controls participated in a 3-day
training with cognitive and affective control tasks. The training sessions
employed different tasks relative to the pre/post-training sessions to
assess improvement across cognitive control tasks. Additionally, 128channel EEG was collected during resting and task states in the pre- and
post-training sessions to probe the effects of training on brain function.
Preliminary behavioral analyses show that participants improved performance over the course of training (i.e. reduced RT and increased accuracy). Critically, comparison of pre- vs. post-training data revealed
improved post-training performance (RT) specific to trials requiring
recruitment of cognitive control. Furthermore, improvement in pre-topost RT was significantly correlated with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity (using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to source localize EEG), while rostral
anterior cingulate cortex was associated with post-error adaptation.
These results suggest that cognitive control can be improved in healthy
subjects. We hypothesize that MDD individuals might benefit from a
similar training.

NEURAL EVIDENCE FOR A RETRIEVAL-BASED MODEL OF CONFLICT
ADAPTATION Derek Nee1,2, Sabine Kastner3, Joshua Brown1; 1Indiana

University, 2University of Michigan, 3Princeton University — A central tenet of

many theories of cognitive control is that sustained, goal-related activation in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) drives dynamic adjustments in
control. By contrast, opposing theories posit that adaptation results from
rapid learning and retrieval mechanisms. Here, we delineated between
these accounts by examining the time-course of control-related activations in LPFC in a Stroop-like task. Conflict adaptation effects were
present behaviorally even in the absence of sustained top-down signals.
Instead, adaptive effects in the LPFC were reflected by speeded activations consistent with retrieval-based priming. Strikingly, these effects
were independent of conflict and instead reflected the degree to which
the current stimulus category matched the most recent stimulus category
in memory. Moreover, speeded activations in the LPFC were correlated
with downstream enhancements and behavior. These results challenge
the notion that sustained LPFC activations drive flexible behavior and
establish that transient retrieval-based effects produce adaptive control.

Lancashire, UK — Human timing is thought to be based on the output of
an internal clock. Whilst the functioning of this clock is well documented
in the literature, it is unclear which other cognitive resources may moderate timing. Previous research suggests that the central executive of
working memory may be recruited during human prospective timing
(Brown, 2006; Rattat, 2010), in particular inhibitory control. However it
seems likely that the other executive component processes identified by
Miyake et al. (2000) and Fisk and Sharp (2004) may contribute to timing
performance; further exploration of this was the aim of the present
study. An interference paradigm was employed in which participants
completed an interval production task, and tasks which have been
shown to tap the four key executive component processes (shifting, inhibition, updating and access) under single and dual-task conditions.
Comparison of performance on all tasks under single and dual-task conditions indicated that timing always became more variable when concurrently performing a second task. Bidirectional interference only occurred
between the interval production task and the memory updating task,
implying that both tasks are competing for the same executive resource

of updating. There was no evidence in the current study to suggest that
switching, inhibition or access were involved in timing, however it is
acknowledged that under more difficult task conditions switching and
inhibition resources may be recruited.

viduals family history positive for alcoholism (FHP) show increased
alcoholism rates and are more impulsive than those without alcoholism
family histories (FHN), possibly due to altered NMDA/DA interactions
in FHP. We investigated whether the NMDA receptor antagonist,
memantine, differentially affects Go/No-Go brain activity in matched
FHP (n=15) and FHN (n=15) individuals. On two separate days, participants received 40mg memantine or identical-appearing placebo 4-hrs
prior to fMRI testing in a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design. During fMRI participants responded to Go stimuli (85%)
and withheld responses to No-Go stimuli (15%). SPM results were
thresholded at p<.001 (k=5voxels). Behaviorally, there were no differences between groups on Go-RT or No-Go false alarms on placebo. GoRT was increased (p<0.05) on memantine vs. placebo; this effect was
marginally larger in FHN. FMRI activity for successful inhibitions (NoGo>Go) and false alarms (No-Go Errors>Go) did not differ between
groups on placebo. Successful inhibitions during placebo activated a distributed fronto-temporal-parietal-subcortical network including middle/inferior frontal gyri (MFG/IFG), middle/inferior temporal gyri
(MTG/ITG), cingulate, and putamen. Memantine increased No-Go>Go
activity in caudate, IFG and MTG/ITG for FHN. For FHP, this modulation was absent except in IFG. Instead, memantine decreased activity in
cingulate and caudate. False alarms during placebo activated a distributed fronto-temporal-parietal-subcortical network including bilateral
IFG, putamen, and MTG. Memantine increased No-Go errors>Go activity in MTG for FHN, and decreased MTG and putamen activity in FHP.
Overall, results show that NMDA receptor antagonists do not modulate
an extended response inhibition neural system in FHP to the degree seen
in FHN.

O'Connell2, Mark Bellgrove1; 1Queensland Brain Institute, University of
Queensland, 2School of Psychology and Trinity College Institute of
Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin — The ability to monitor performance

and ignore distracting information is critical for achieving goals, and
multiple neurotransmitter systems have been implicated. Electrophysiological indices of both interference control and error processing, such as
the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe), have been
shown to be modulated following dopaminergic, noradrenergic or serotonergic pharmacological challenge. In this study, 27 non-clinical males
took part in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over
study. Each participant was administered methylphenidate (dopamine/
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor), atomoxetine (noradrenaline reuptake
inhibitor), citalopram (serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or placebo across 4
separate sessions. Each participant performed the Eriksen flanker task
while undergoing electroencephalogram recording in each of the 4 sessions. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that task accuracy was significantly improved by methylphenidate compared to atomoxetine
(p=0.024), citalopram (p=0.039) and placebo (p=0.001). This increased
accuracy due to methylphenidate was not associated with a commensurate slowing of reaction time. There was also a significant main effect of
drug on accuracy for incongruent trials which reflected enhanced accu-

racy under methylphenidate compared to placebo (p=0.002). The effect
of drug on accuracy for congruent trials tended towards significance
(p=0.06). Changes in the amplitude or latency of the relevant eventrelated potentials (ERN, Pe) as a function of drug condition will also be
presented. The results from this study suggest that methylphenidate, but
not atomoxetine or citalopram, has a specific effect on improving interference control. Since methylphenidate has a dual action on both dopamine and noradrenaline, our results provide further evidence for the
catecholaminergic modulation of interference control.

Institute of Neuroscience — Response inhibition, a key component of executive control, refers to the ability to inhibit pre-potent responses. The
Stop-Signal task, a paradigmatic measure of response inhibition, allows
for the calculation of Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) - a reflection of
the speed of the inhibitory process. Behavioural measures of inhibitory
control, such as SSRT are highly heritable and have been proposed as
endophenotypes for disorders of catecholamine dysregulation such as
ADHD. Here we used genetic association analyses and functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the genetic drivers of response inhibition in non-clinical participants. In a sample of 405 healthy adults, we
investigated the association between SSRT and allelic variation in Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of a range of catecholamine system
genes involved in the regulation and signaling of dopamine and/or
noradrenaline. Markers on the Dopamine transporter gene, DAT1,
accounted for significant variance in SSRT, after controlling for age and
gender, and survived corrections for multiple comparisons. The influence of the most significantly associated SNP, rs37020, was then further
investigated in a targeted fMRI study of inhibitory control using a subset
of the larger cohort (n=50). Activation associated with response inhibition (successful stop–go contrast) varied significantly with genotype in
frontal and caudate regions. Thus our imaging genetic data support our
behavioural associations and indicate that DNA variation in dopaminergic genes modulates fronto-striatal circuits supporting inhibitory control. Given that response inhibition is a viable endophenotype for
ADHD, these data suggest that DAT1 rs37020 might be profitably investigated as a susceptibility marker for ADHD.

Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Netherlands, 3Department of
Psychiatry, UMC St. Radboud, Netherlands — Aim: The error-related negativity (ERN) event-related brain potential (EEG/ERP) provides an index
of dopamine transmission in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a central neural circuit in target detection, error-processing and response
monitoring. Research has shown attenuated amplitude of the ERN in
ADHD, reflecting disturbed ACC and dopaminergic functioning, proposed to underlie attention problems in the disorder. In this study errorprocessing (ERN) was examined in ADHD before and after exposure to
mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT). We hypothesized the
mindfulness process would improve ACC modulation, reflected by
changes in the ERN/ERP. Method: N = 14 (7M) adults with DSM-IV
diagnosed ADHD were randomly allocated to either; 1) MBCT (N = 7;
mean age =37), or 2) waiting-list control (N=7; mean age =32). All
patients performed a visual continuous performance task (X-CPT; 20%
inhibition rate), concomitant to EEG/ERP recording, before and after the
8-week MBCT intervention period. Results: Preliminary findings

154

showed increases in amplitude of the early ERN/Ne (error-negativity)
and later Pe (error-positivity) components of the ERN/ERP to false
alarms, following exposure to MBCT compared to baseline amplitude
measures. Pre-to-post increases in ERN amplitude were not apparent in
the waiting-list control data. Neurophysiological effects were specific to
amplitude; no differences were evident in latency measures. Summary:
ERN amplitude increase correlates to increases in dopamine receptor
levels and greater ACC efficiency in error processing. We found MBCT
enhanced ERN amplitudes to errors in adults with ADHD. Such preliminary findings suggest MBCT may provide a promising intervention for
ADHD symptoms, specifically impulsivity and inattentiveness.

LESIONS Jutta Peterburs1, Kathrin Gajda1, Benno Koch2, Michael Schwarz2,

Irene Daum1, Klaus-Peter Hoffmann1, Christian Bellebaum1; 1Ruhr University
Bochum, Germany, 2Klinikum Dortmund, Germany — Event-related potentials (ERP) research has identified a negative deflection within about 100
ms after an erroneous response as a correlate of awareness-independent
error processing. This component, referred to as error-related negativity
or error negativity (Ne/ERN), has been shown to originate from the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Its time course suggests an internal
error monitoring system acting rapidly based on central information
such as an efference copy signal. However, there is as yet no empirical
evidence directly linking the Ne/ERN to efference copy signals. Since
both studies on monkeys and humans have implicated the thalamus as
an important relay station for efference copy signals, the present study
investigated the Ne/ERN in patients with focal vascular damage to the
thalamus. Five patients and 40 control participants completed an antisaccade task with simultaneous electroencephalographic recording (EEG).
While behavioural performance in regard to the number of errors did
not differ between patients and controls, Ne/ERN amplitude was generally attenuated in patients. Three patients showed a significant reduction
of the Ne/ERN compared to a subgroup of age-matched controls. In
these patients, no clear NE/ERN could be identified for both left- and
rightward saccade errors. Lesions comprised the right mediodorsal and
ventroanterior thalamus in two patients, and the left ventrolateral and
right ventroanterior thalamus in one patient. The results suggest altered
error processing in focal thalamic lesion patients and support the notion
that the Ne/ERN is based on efference copy signals. The functional contributions of different thalamic substructures remain to be determined.

Dallas, 2Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins Hospital — The ability to
inhibit irrelevant information and attend to relevant information is critical for efficient processing of information. The extent to which aging
affects inhibition that is contingent upon semantic information is
unknown. We examined inhibitory processes using event-related potentials (ERPs) in 28 younger and older adults (65 y+) on two Go-NoGo
tasks that required different degrees of semantic categorization. The simpler task (Single Cars-Dogs; SC) included a line drawing of a dog (Go
Stimuli) and a car (NoGo Stimuli). The complex task (Object Animal;
OA) consisted of objects (Go) and animals (NoGo). Participants pushed a
button for the ‘Go Stimuli’ and withheld responses for the ‘NoGo Stimuli’. ERP data revealed that in the semantically simpler task (SC), the N2
amplitude was more negative for Go trials compared to NoGo trials in
older adults (p = .007), a pattern opposite that of younger adults. Additionally, the P3 latency for Go trials was longer compared to NoGo trials
(p = .009) in older adults, however these differences were not significant
in younger adults. In the more complex task (OA), the N2 did not differ
significantly across Go-NoGo trials in older adults contrary to those in
younger adults (p < .001). These findings indicate that older adults
appear to attend to the Go stimuli as a strategy in the simpler task (SC)

Catherine Fassbender1,2, Julie B. Schweitzer1, Ruth Salo2; 1M.I.N.D Institute,
University of California Davis Medical Center, 2Imaging Research Center,
University of California Davis Medical Center — Faulty response inhibition
has also been implicated in long term substance abuse and ADHD. An
ADHD diagnosis puts one at an increased risk of substance dependence
compared to the general population. As inhibition has been associated
with brain regions that are impaired in both ADHD and methamphetamine (MA) abusers, the identification of common and differing cognitive impairments in MA abusers with and without ADHD may provide
insight into addiction, drug-seeking behaviors and the cessation of drug
use. We used a GO/NOGO paradigm with varying stimulus presentation times to investigate cognitive control and response inhibition in
long-term MA abusers who were currently drug abstinent (3 mos to 2
yrs) compared to healthy controls. MA abusers were divided into two
groups: MA+ADHD and MA-ADHD). MA-ADHD and MA+ADHD
groups made more omission errors on the GO/NOGO task compared to
controls; however post hoc comparisons revealed significant differences
only between MA-ADHD and control subjects. There was a significant
interaction between group status and stimulus presentation time for
commission errors (pressing a button to a NOGO) such that the MAADHD group displayed a different pattern of commission errors with
varying stimulus presentation time compared to the other two groups.
Thus far our data suggest differences between MA abusers with and
without an ADHD diagnosis on inhibition with differing speed-accuracy
trade-offs. We aim to pinpoint cognitive impairments associated with
performance monitoring and attention in MA-ADHD and MA+ADHD
in a larger group.

INHIBITION OF IMITATIVE AND SPATIALLY COMPATIBLE RESPONSES
SHARE NEURAL CIRCUITRY Katy Cross1, Marco Iacoboni1; 1UCLA —
Recent work demonstrates that imitation can be unconscious and automatic, and the existence of patients exhibiting reflexive imitation suggests that some mechanism normally inhibits imitative behavior. It has
been proposed that control of imitation occurs through a dedicated
mechanism related to social cognition. In contrast, proponents of the
common coding hypothesis argue that imitation is simply an extreme
form of stimulus-response compatibility, implying a similar mechanism
for overcoming automatic imitation and spatially compatible stimulusresponse associations. To disentangle these possibilities, 16 subjects performed a stimulus-response compatibility task during fMRI. Video stimuli depicted either extension of a finger (index or middle; imitative
stimuli), or one of two dots moving with the same trajectory (spatial
stimuli). Subjects were instructed to extend their own index or middle
finger on the same (compatible blocks) or opposite (incompatible blocks)
side as the stimulus. Dual route models explaining stimulus-response
compatibility effects propose that inhibition of the compatible response
is required to respond correctly on incompatible trials. Incompatible >
Compatible contrasts for spatial and imitative cues revealed identical
patterns of activation: bilateral dorsal premotor, superior parietal and
pre-supplementary motor areas. Direct comparison between imitative
and spatial compatibility effects revealed no differences. Reaction time
analyses also reflected a single inhibitory mechanism: 2(stimulus type) x
2(compatibility) ANOVA revealed only a compatibility main effect and
the two compatibility effects were highly correlated (r=0.87). Thus, in
agreement with the common coding hypothesis, these data suggest that
overcoming automatic response activation by both imitative and spatial
cues occurs through a common neural mechanism.

WHEN HIGH-POWERED PEOPLE CHOKE UNDER PRESSURE: THE COST
OF BEING WATCHED BY THE EXPERIMENTER Clément Belletier1,2, Karen

Davranche1, Boris Burle1, Florence Dumas1, Thierry Hasbroucq1, Franck Vidal1,
Pascal Huguet1; 1Université de Provence et CNRS, Marseille, France, 2Direction
Générale de l’Armement — Only individuals with a high working-memory
capacity (WMC) choke under performance pressure on difficult tasks,
suggesting that pressure consumes the executive resources they usually
rely on to achieve their superior performance. We predicted that only
those individuals choke under evaluative audience in a task requiring
executive control. After having completed a WM span test, 54 participants performed a Simon task either in isolation, in presence of a peerconfederate, or in presence of an evaluative audience—the experimenter.
The Simon task consisted to a fast button-press according to the colour of
a stimulus located to the left or the right side of a panel. Classically, reaction time is shorter on congruent than on incongruent trials (stimulus
presented in the same vs. opposite spatial location of the response),
referred to as the “Simon effect”. When working in isolation, participants
with a high WMC displayed better performance (smaller Simon effect)
than their low WMC counterparts (14 ms vs. 28 ms), providing further
evidence that individual differences in WMC correspond to differences
in executive control. As expected, however, the high WMC participants’
advantage did not persist in presence of a confederate (23 ms vs. 23 ms),
and turned in favour of the low-WMC participants in presence of the
experimenter (37 ms vs. 24 ms). This suggests that performance pressure
undermines executive control in high WMC individuals. More generally,
the fact that this effect occurred in the experimenter’s presence has
strong implications for research in Experimental Psychology.

THETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS COORDINATE LOCAL AND LONG-RANGE
NEURAL NETWORKS IN THE MEDIAL FRONTAL CORTEX DURING
COGNITIVE CONTROL Michael Cohen1,2; 1University of Amsterdam,

psychology, 2University of Arizona, physiology — Theta is a prominent frequency band observed in direct recordings of the medial prefrontal cortex in humans and nonhuman primates. Medial frontal theta has been
linked to error monitoring and feedback processing during learning
tasks, and, at the neurobiological level, to synaptic mechanisms of learning, information coding, and inter-regional communication. I will
present evidence consistent with the idea that the medial frontal cortex
uses theta oscillations to coordinate local and long-range neural networks during cognitive control processes. First, activity recorded locally
from the medial frontal cortex correlates with response errors, conflict,
and negative performance feedback, and in some cases predicts the
extent to which behavior is adjusted in the near future. Second, hypothesis-driven synchronization analyses suggest that the medial frontal cortex uses the theta band to interact with lateral prefrontal, occipital, and
ventral striatal regions. Third, hypothesis-free, exploratory mass-synchronization analyses based on graph theory confirm that medial frontal
theta during cognitive control tasks reflects a strong “hub” for information flow. Finally, combined EEG and diffusion tensor imaging (which
measures structural white matter tracts) reveals that error-related medial
frontal theta is linked to anatomical tracts to the ventral striatum and
inferior frontal gyrus, whereas long-range cortico-cortical functional
connectivity strength is linked to corpus callosum white matter tracts.
Together, these findings paint a picture of theta as a language used by
the medial frontal cortex to monitor actions and bias activity in brain circuits involved in sensory, motor, social, and emotional processing in
order to optimize goal-directed behavior.

‘drives,’ and Neal Miller’s examination of competing inclinations. We
outline how conscious conflict is just one of many kinds of interaction in
the nervous system and analyze what is special about it. Other kinds of
interactions, such as ‘afference binding’ (e.g., intra- or inter-sensory
interactions), or interactions involving non-skeletal muscle effectors, can
occur unconsciously. Similarly, stimulus-response associations (‘efference binding’), such as pressing a button in response to a subliminal
stimulus, can occur unconsciously. In our within-subjects designed EEG
study (n = 13), we compared the neural correlates of conscious conflict
(Stroop conflict) to those of an unconscious, intersensory conflict (the
McGurk effect). Analyses of Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP)
and inter-regional coherence revealed that, compared to unconscious
forms of conflict, conscious conflict consistently resulted in increased
gamma band activity (~40 Hz) at various frontal and parietal sites, in
addition to increased gamma and theta band coherence between frontal
and parietal regions. (We also examined conflict during a more motivational task, the ‘cold pressor’ task.) The Stroop conflict results are consistent with findings that implicate synchronous frontal-parietal gamma
and theta oscillations in the integration of cortical information, a form of
large-scale integration that has been associated with conscious experience (Doesberg et al., 2009; Melloni et al., 2007; Morsella, 2005). Together,
these data begin to illuminate the difference between the cognitive and
neural aspects of conscious and unconscious conflicts.

PERFORMANCE ON GO/NOGO AND STOP-SIGNAL RESPONSE
INHIBITION TASKS IS NOT CORRELATED Diane Swick1,2, Victoria Ashley1,

And Turken1; 1VA Northern California Health Care System, 2University of
California, Davis — Two major tasks are used to assess response inhibition,
an essential executive control function. In the Go/NoGo (GNG) task, a
motor response is made to one stimulus class and withheld to another. In
the Stop-Signal Task (SST), responses are made on every trial unless a
stop signal is presented. Although these two tasks are often treated interchangeably, it is unclear whether they tap the same cognitive processes
and neural substrates. A previous meta-analysis of the neuroimaging literature suggested they have both overlapping and distinct neural substrates, the latter reflected by differential recruitment of two cognitive
control networks (Swick et al., 2010). Here, we present data from 49 subjects tested in standard versions of GNG and SST. We wished to see
whether performance on the two tasks was correlated. Participants
included controls (n=25) and patients with TBI and/or PTSD (n=17) or
focal frontal lesions (n=7). In GNG, subjects responded to all letters
except for X, the NoGo stimulus occurring on 50% or 10% of trials. In
SST, subjects responded to all R or L arrows unless they heard the stop
signal tone on 25% of the trials. Stop signal delay was adjusted using a 4staircase procedure designed to produce 50% error rate. Stopping ability
was measured by stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and compared to
GNG error rates. Results demonstrated that within and across groups,
NoGo errors were not correlated with SSRT. Combined with the metaanalysis results, these data suggest GNG and SST are not identical measures of response inhibition.

THE USE OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE PATTERN CLASSIFICATION TO
DISTINGUISH PSYCHOPATHS FROM NON-PSYCHOPATHS IN A PRISON
POPULATION Scott Freeman1, Craig Bennett1, Kent Kiehl2,3, Michael

Gazzaniga1, Michael Miller1; 1University of California, Santa Barbara, 2The
Mind Research Network, 3University of New Mexico — Psychopathy is a term

used to classify individuals who exhibit low levels of affect, interpersonal problems, and socially deviant behaviors. Based on recent neuroimaging studies, it is hypothesized that such abnormalties in
psychopaths result from dysfunction in paralimbic regions, such as the
anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex (Kiehl,
2006). Using fMRI data collected from a prison population, we sought to
distinguish psychopaths from non-psychopaths on a Go/Nogo task.
Individuals were identified as “psychopaths” if their Psychopathy

156

Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) score exceeded an established threshold for
psychopathy. We predicted that psychopathic prisoners, relative to nonpsychopathic prisoners, would have less activation in paralimbic
regions. Using the General Linear Model (GLM), our results indicated no
differences in activation between psychopaths and non-psychopaths
when using thresholds correcting for multiple comparisons. Similarly, a
regression analysis that correlated individuals’ PCL-R scores with their
BOLD activity yielded no significant areas of activation. We then analyzed the fMRI data with support vector machine (SVM) classification,
which investigates regional patterns of activity that the GLM is not sensitive to. The most predictive region was the right posterior cingulate, separating psychopaths from non-psychopaths with 80 percent accuracy
(Chance = 50 percent). Other high-performance regions include the left
posterior cingulate and the right superior orbitofrontal cortex, both of
which achieved 77 percent accuracy. These results indicate that the support vector machine classifiers were able to detect patterns of activity
that were not detected with standard GLM method, and the results from
the SVM analyses lend support to the paralimbic hypothesis.

ERROR PROCESSING AND POST ERROR ADJUSTMENT IN A FLANKER
TASK Yann Cojan1,2, Camille Piguet1,2, Patrik Vuilleumier1,2; 1University of

Geneva, 2Center for Neuroscience — The ability to detect errors and adjust
behavior accordingly is essential for maneuvering in an uncertain environment. the brain correlates of post error adjustments that occur in
executive control tasks are poorly known. We recorded 32 subjects performing a modified flanker task in a 3T magnet. As expected the behavioral results showed a significant incongruency effect (F = 27.689,
p<0.001) and a strong post error slowing (t = 2.97, p = 0.006). Those
behavioral results were concomitant with activation of a conflict network including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula, and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). In addition, an error detection network
including the same regions (ACC and insula) was more activated, but
additionally accompanied by specific dorsal striatal activations. Finally,
we observed an increase in a bilateral attentional network including
parietal cortex and LPFC for the post error trials. Conversely, post error
trials disengaged ventral striatum. Those results support recent findings
that frontal cortical areas play distinct executive roles in behavioral
adjustments: the ACC acts retroactively to enable behavioral adaptation
whereas the LPFC reconfigures cognitive processes constituting the
adjustment. Furthermore, we found a striatal involvement in the post
error adjustments. This new finding in fMRI investigations support the
striatum mediate cortical signals to achieve behavioral adjustments. We
conclude that adaptation of behavior requires a fine-tuned recruitment
of the frontal cortical-basal ganglia neural network.

METACOGNITVE AND ATTENTION TRAINING AND ERROR MONITORING IN
EARLY CHILDHOOD M. Rosario Rueda1, J. Paul Pozuelos1, Pedro M. Paz-

Alonso1,2, Lina Combita-Merchan1, Alicia Abundis1; 1Universidad de Granada,
2Basque Center for Brain and Language — Adjustment to task demands is a

crucial ingredient of goal-directed behavior. The ability to detect and
monitor errors helps adjusting responses to the environment. The errorrelated negativity (ERN) is an early (~80ms) component frequently used
to study conflict resolution. The ERN is characterized by a negative
deflection in fronto-medial sites after incorrect responses, and constitutes an electrophysiological marker of error detection. Recent evidence
indicates that this ERN effect emerges over middle childhood years, with
smaller but consistent changes across adolescence. The present ERP
study was aimed at investigating the effects of attentional training
(metacognitive, standard, and control) on error detection and monitoring processes in children aged 5 to 6. We designed a child-friendly
flanker task using rows of five robots of different shapes (rounded,
squared) as stimuli. Participants were asked to focus on the middle
robot, ignoring the flanker robots (congruent vs. incongruent to middle
robot), to indicate its rounded or squared shape by two-button key
presses. The duration of the target stimuli was tailored to individuals’

performance to ensure similar levels of challenge and number of errors
across participants. Behavioral results revealed no differences in the percentage of errors committed by children assigned to the different training groups. Children who received metacognitive training showed the
ERN component in frontal sites (AFz-Fz) about 55-90ms after response.
This effect did not emerge in the standard training and control groups.
These findings underscore the importance of using metacognitive strategies in attentional training programs to enhance error detection processes during early childhood.

IMPROVEMENT OF INHIBITORY CONTROL OVER REWARD-RELATED
STIMULI AND INCREASES IN CONTROL-RELATED BOLD ACTIVITY
ASSOCIATED WITH MONETARY PUNISHMENT David O'Connor1, Sarah
Rossiter1, Robert Hester1; 1Department of Psychological Sciences, University
of Melbourne — Previous research has indentified the neural mechanisms

associated with inhibitory control, including regions in the prefrontal
cortex and anterior cingulate cortices, but it remains unclear how these
mechanisms are influenced by reward and punishment. Our aim was to
examine the impact that reward and punishment has on the ability to
exert inhibitory control. Understanding this relationship is critical to
understanding the failure to control impulsiveness for reward seen in
clinical conditions such as drug addiction. Using a Go/No-Go response
inhibition paradigm that rewarded 17 participants for successful inhibition in an event-related fMRI design, we assessed how the presence of
either monetary gain or loss for inhibition failure influences No-Go inhibition performance and associated BOLD activation. Findings showed
that response inhibition accuracy over rewarding stimuli was significantly higher for the punishment condition compared to the reward condition. Similarly, activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus during
successful inhibition was found to be greater for the punishment condition. Such a finding implies that a motivational influence can be exerted
on cognitive control processes, whereby an absence of punishment for
commission of errors increases the difficulty of inhibiting rewarding
stimuli. Results suggest a particular sensitivity of the right inferior frontal gyrus within the cognitive control network to exert top-down attentional control of prepotent responses during circumstances in which an
incorrect response can result in a negative outcome.

SOURCES OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN NEURAL ACTIVITY: A GENETRAIT INTERACTION IN FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
OF EASY AND DIFFICULT EXECUTIVE TASKS Colin DeYoung1, Zarrar

Shehzad2, Elena Grigorenko2, Jeremy Gray2; 1University of Minnesota, 2Yale
University — Systematic individual differences in normal brain function

are increasingly of interest. We explored multiple sources of variability
in neural response to executive cognitive tasks in a healthy, adult, male
sample (N = 104) using a gene-trait interaction model. “Externalizing” is
a trait representing risk for behavior problems involving impulsivity,
aggression, antisocial behavior, and/or drug abuse. Externalizing problems are associated with poor executive function. We tested whether
variation in dopaminergic genes specifically influential on the functions
of prefrontal cortex (DRD4 and COMT) would interact with Externalizing to predict individual differences in neural activity during easy and
difficult executive tasks. The Multiple Sources of Interference Task
(MSIT) requires inhibitory control over prepotent responses; it induces
few errors but reliably activates a cingulo-frontal-parietal executive
attention network similar to that activated by the more difficult 3-Back
task, which requires detection of matches between the current stimulus
and that presented three previously. We observed significant gene x trait
x task-difficulty interactions in the prediction of neural activity. Both
COMT and DRD4 moderated the association of Externalizing with neural activity during executive cognition; however, the directions of association for different genotypes were opposite for easy versus difficult
tasks. In the MSIT, low dopamine-function genotypes were associated
with a positive slope for Externalizing, and high dopamine-function gen-

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

otypes were associated with a negative slope. In the 3-Back, the slopes
for each genotype group were reversed. These results illustrate the
extent of meaningful individual differences in neural activity and provide proof of concept that their sources can be identified.

OXYGENATION DURING RESPONSE INHIBITION TASKS Juliane Kopf1,

Martin Schecklmann2, Tim Hahn1, Alica Dieler1, Andreas Reif1; 1University of
Wuerzburg, Germany, 2University of Regensburg, Germany — Objective:
Impulsivity is a trait shared by many psychiatric disorders and therefore
could be a suitable intermediate phenotype for underlying biological
mechanisms. One of the molecular determinants involved is a regulatory
repeat length polymorphism in the gene encoding the neuronal isoform
of nitric oxide synthase (NOS1), termed NOS1 ex1f-VNTR: short variants
of NOS1 ex1f-VNTR, causing decreased expression of the transcript, are
associated with a variety of impulsive behaviours. Method: 56 healthy
controls were stratified into a homozygous long and short allele group
matched for age and sex. All subjects completed a combined stop-signal
go/nogo task, while the oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex was measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy. An EMG was administered to control for the differences in muscle activity in the two
inhibition tasks. Test subjects also completed the I7 and the UPPS.
Results: Differences between the two tasks could be shown by means of
significantly different areas of oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex. After
correction for multiple testing, the nogo task showed activation mostly
in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas the successful and unsuccessful inhibition conditions of the stop-signal task showed the predicted
activity in the inferior frontal cortex. Although the two genotype groups
does not show significant differences in either the questionnaires or the
behavioral data, the long allele group displayed dorsolateral prefrontal
activity during the nogo condition while there were no significant activation in the short allele group. Additionally they show the predicted activation in the inferior frontal cortex, meanwhile the short allele group
does not.

INTERACTION BETWEEN STOP-SIGNAL INHIBITION AND TASK CONFLICT
IN THE STROOP TASK: EVIDENCE FOR TWO SEPARATE CONTROL
MECHANISMS Eyal Kalanthroff1, Liat Goldfarb2, Avishai Henik1;
1Department of Psychology and Zlotowski Center for Neuroscience, Ben-Gurion

University of Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel, 2Department of Psychology, Center for
the Study of Brain, Mind, and Behavior, Princeton University, Princeton, New
Jersey — Performance in the Stroop task reflects effects of two conflicts:

the informational conflict (between the information provided by the
incongruent word and ink color) and the task conflict (between the relevant color naming task and the irrelevant word reading task). Neuroimaging studies imply that congruent as well as incongruent trials cause a
conflict, which Goldfarb and Henik (2007) argued is due to the task conflict. They found that when task control was damaged, there was a
Stroop reverse facilitation (reaction times for congruent trials were
slower than for neutral trials), which is the behavioral indication for task
conflict. Task conflict requires certain control processes that may be different from those involved in the informational conflict. Here we suggest
that the stop-signal and Stroop task conflicts can be conceptualized as
inhibition of prepotent responses, and share the same control mechanism. In the current study, we combined the stop-signal and the Stroop
tasks, and found that when participants’ control failed during the stopsignal task (i.e., the response did not stop), a reverse facilitation emerged
in the Stroop task (Experiment 1). This reverse Stroop facilitation was
restricted to the condition in which no task conflict existed in the neutral
condition (Experiment 2). In addition, when participants failed in the
stop-signal task the informational conflict was not affected. This suggests that task conflict and stop-signal inhibition share a common mechanism of prepotent response inhibition and that a different control
mechanism exists in the Stroop informational conflict.

ALERTNESS CAN INTERACT WITH COGNITIVE CONTROL BY INCREASING
THE INFLUENCE OF DISTRACTING VISUAL STIMULI Noam Weinbach1,
Avishai Henik1; 1Ben-Gurion University of the Negev — Researchers have sug-

gested that distinct attentional systems can interact under certain conditions. Specifically, the alerting system has been found to increase
interference of cognitive conflict in the flanker task. This effect was interpreted as an inhibition of the alerting system on executive control. We
explored the mechanisms underlying this effect. Twenty healthy participants performed a flanker task in which they indicated whether a rectangle target was tilted to the left or right. Flankers could be tilted in the
same direction as the target (congruent condition) or in the opposite
direction (incongruent condition). We used two target-flanker conditions. In the difficult perceptual condition, the target and flankers were
tilted only 5 degrees to the left or right of a vertical position, making perceptual discrimination in the incongruent condition difficult. In the easy
perceptual condition, the target and flankers were tilted 45 degrees from
a vertical position, making discrimination easier in the incongruent condition. In half of the trials an alerting auditory tone was presented prior
to the target. Our results revealed a significant interaction between alertness and congruency in the difficult perceptual condition—the congruency effect was larger after alerting signals. When perceptual
discrimination was easier, the congruency effect was not modulated by
alertness. We suggest this indicates an adaptive mechanism that allows
better allocation of attention to perceptual information when highly
alerted. However, this mechanism creates a cost when selective attention
to detail is required.

DISSOCIATION OF BRAIN REGIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PERCEPTUAL
AND MOTOR CONFLICT Suzanne Clerkin1, Olga Berwid1,2, Stavroula

Galanopoulos1,2, Kurt Schulz1, Jin Fan1,2, Jeffrey Halperin1,2; 1Mount Sinai
School of Medicine, 2Queens College, City University of New York — Ignoring

irrelevant information and suppressing inappropriate motor responses
are hallmarks of cognitive control. It has been proposed that distinct
neural systems are responsible for resolving perceptual and motor conflict. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has a role in detection
of response conflict, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is
involved in response conflict resolution. However, perceptual conflict
studies have yielded varied results in regards to the involvement of
DLPFC, dACC, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Conflicting results
might be the due to varying task demands that have included extraneous
stimulus-response modality conflicts. The Perceptual and Motor Conflict
Task (PMCT) is a non-verbal task designed to probe neural systems associated with perceptual, motor, and combined perceptual and motor conflict. Twenty-two adults (mean age = 23.95, SD = 1.52) were scanned with
fMRI while performing the PMCT. Stimulus conflict was associated with
activation of supplementary motor area (SMA), DLPFC, and fusiform
gyrus. Motor conflict was associated with activation of SMA, DLPFC,
insula, dACC, IFG, thalamus, and caudate. The combined conflict condition induced more diffuse activation in the SMA, DLPFC, dACC, IFG,
thalamus, caudate, insula, and the brainstem. These results suggest partially overlapping neural systems for perceptual and motor conflict monitoring and resolution. DLPFC and SMA were activated by all conflict
conditions. In contrast, response conflict and combined conflict activated
subcortical regions associated with attention and motor inhibition.
Increased interference from competing stimuli and increased demands
on cognitive control systems might be responsible for more diffuse activation during the combined conflict condition.

AN ERP INVESTIGATION OF CONTEXT SPECIFIC COGNITIVE CONTROL
USING A SIMON TASK Chris Blais1, George R Mangun1; 1UC Davis — Blais
and Bunge (2010, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience) reported an fMRI
study indicating that anterior cingulate and left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortices subserve proportion effects at both the list- and item-specific lev-

158

els. The list-level proportion congruency effect--the observation that the
Stroop effect increases as the proportion of congruent trials in a block
increases--has long been used as an index of cognitive control. Contemporary work shows that proportion effects can also be item-specific; if
the items in a Stroop task are 75% congruent when presented at the top
of the screen and 25% congruent when presented on the bottom of the
screen, then the Stroop effect is larger for the items appearing at the top.
An ERP study is reported investigating these item-specific proportion
effects in the context of a Simon effect. The Simon effect refers to the
observation that responses are faster and more accurate the targets that
are spatially compatible with there response button. Specifically, if X
requires a left button press, it is faster to respond to an X on the left side
of the screen compared to the right side. In addition to attention related
effects on P1 and N1 amplitudes we find a strong N2 effect. The scalp
topography for the N2 is consistent with a generator located in the anterior cingulate. These results are consistent with a conflict monitoring
mechanism that is sensitive to environmental contingencies (see Blais,
Robidoux, Risko, & Besner, 2007, Psychological Review; Verguts & Notebaert, 2008, Psychological Review).

Executive Processes: Working memory
F52
EVIDENCE FOR A NON-MONOTONIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
PREFRONTAL AND PARIETAL CORTEX ACTIVATION AND WORKING
MEMORY LOAD Jared X Van Snellenberg1,2, Jochen Weber1, Edward E
Smith1,2; 1Columbia University, 2New York State Psychiatric Institute — Clas-

sic studies in the neuroimaging of working memory have led to the view
that a network of brain regions exhibit monotonic increases in activation
with increasing memory load, although several authors have proposed
that activation may become non-monotonic at sufficiently high loads. In
order to test this hypothesis, we carried out functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging while participants performed a Self-Ordered Working
Memory task (SOWMT). On each trial participants were presented with
eight line drawings of 3D objects in an array. On each step of every trial,
participants were instructed to select any object that they had not previously selected; after each step, the object positions were re-randomized.
The SOWMT produced activation in a network of regions typically activated by WM tasks. Activation in many of these regions was non-monotonic across steps, with activation highest at the intermediate steps.
Furthermore, the step at which individual subjects exhibited peak activation in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was significantly correlated with a
behavioral estimate of their WM capacity. Thus, activation in the classic
WM network varies non-monotonically with load when a sufficiently
sensitive task is employed. Although the cause of decreases in activation
at higher loads is unclear, they likely reflect a shift in strategy by participants--for example a shift to a long term memory strategy or from retrospective to prospective coding of target stimuli. Furthermore, the step at
which activation peaks in PPC is correlated with estimates of WM capacity, consistent with the results of studies of visual change detection.

AUDITORY-VISUAL SPEECH ENHANCES WORKING MEMORY
PERFORMANCE IN YOUNGER AND OLDER ADULTS Jana Frtusova1, Axel

Winneke2, Natalie Phillips1; 1Concordia University, 2Jacobs Center on Lifelong
Learning & Institutional Development, Jacobs University Bremen — Adding
visual speech information (i.e., lip movements) to auditory speech information can enhance speech comprehension while at the same time facilitating electrical brain responses, as measured by event-related potentials
(ERPs). Thus, fewer resources seem to be allocated to speech comprehension when auditory-visual speech information is available. This study
examined whether the brain resources saved at the perceptual level during auditory-visual presentation allow participants to improve on a
working memory (WM) task, and whether older adults (OA) benefit to
the same extent as younger adults (YA). Twenty OAs and 23 YAs completed a WM n-back task (0-, 1-, 2-, 3-back) under visual-only, auditory-

only, and auditory-visual conditions while ERPs were recorded. The
results showed a decrease in reaction time across all memory loads and
improvement in accuracy for 2-back and 3-back during auditory-visual
compared to visual-only and auditory-only conditions. The ERP analysis
showed a smaller N1 amplitude in the auditory-visual compared to A+V
(auditory-only +visual-only) condition for YAs, and compared to the
A+V and auditory-only conditions for OAs. Additionally, the N1
occurred earlier in the auditory-visual than in A+V or auditory-only conditions for both age groups. The reduction in amplitude of N1 during the
auditory-visual condition correlated positively with improved performance on the WM task and with changes in the latency and amplitude of
the P3, an ERP that reflects WM processes. This study provides evidence
that auditory-visual speech enhances WM performance and indicates
that processing resources saved at the perceptual level can be used for
higher-order processing.

FUNCTIONAL MRI INVESTIGATION OF VARIATION IN WORKING MEMORY
CAPACITY: LOOKING FORWARD OR LOOKING BACKWARD? Thomas
Redick1, Ashley Ahrens1, Hillary Schwarb1, Michael Dulas1, Eric Schumacher1,
Randall Engle1; 1Georgia Institute of Technology — Variation in working

memory capacity (WMC) is predictive of higher-order cognition in a
variety of situations requiring cognitive control. One prominent theory
of WMC (Unsworth & Engle, 2007) states that both goal maintenance
within primary memory and retrieval from secondary memory are critical to success in many cognitive activities. More recently, we (Redick,
Calvo, Gay, & Engle, in press) have argued that variation in WMC is
related to the likelihood that an individual will engage in maintenance
versus retrieval. Specifically, high-WMC individuals are more likely to
look forward in time for upcoming stimuli by actively maintaining relevant information. In contrast, low-WMC individuals are more likely to
wait until a stimulus has occurred and then look backward in time to
retrieve the necessary information (see also Braver, Gray, & Burgess,
2007). The current study sought additional evidence to confirm the inferences based on the behavioral data in Redick et al. Twelve high- and 12
low-WMC individuals were identified outside of the scanner via a combination of complex span measures of WMC. In the scanner, participants
performed a conditional go/no-go task used in Redick et al. and based
on an fMRI study by Garavan, Ross, and Stein (1999). The behavioral
data were consistent with Redick et al. in that low-WMC individuals
made more errors specifically on target and lure trials. Critically, lowWMC individuals showed more bilateral hippocampal activity than
high-WMC individuals on targets, consistent with the idea that lowWMC individuals are more likely to rely on retrieval instead of active
maintenance processes.

TRAINING WORKING MEMORY AND NON-VERBAL REASONING IN

Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, 2Stockholm Brain Institute, 3Sykehuset
Buskerud, Norway — Background: Working memory (WM) can be

improved through targeted training. Recently, it was also shown nonverbal reasoning (NVR) was improved after training in healthy preschool children (Bergman Nutley et al. in press, Dev. Sci.). Aim: The current study investigated the applicability and effects of NVR and WM
training in a clinical sample of children with mild to moderate mental
retardation. Methods: Children with a chronological age of six to twelve
years, with IQ < 70 were included. The study was double-blinded and
participants were pseudo-randomly divided into a training group or an
active control group. The training group (n=31) trained with a computerised programme designed to tap both WM and NVR. Difficulty of tasks
was adapted throughout the training period in order to match each participant’s capacity. The active control group (n=17) used the same programme but with unvarying difficulty levels. Results: Training progress
varied largely within the training group, and was significantly related to

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

baseline performance for training on NVR but not WM tasks. Furthermore, training progress influenced the effect of training, with significant
improvements on non-trained WM and NVR tasks (all p-values <0.05)
being observed for participants with high training progress only. Conclusion: We show that it is possible to improve WM and NVR function in
a sample of children with mental retardation, which could have implications for future treatment opportunities for this population. However,
further research is needed to identify factors influencing training ability
and how to further individualize training for children with low intellectual ability.

EVALUATION AND ADJUSTMENT OF CONTROL STRATEGIES DURING
PROACTIVE INTERFERENCE RESOLUTION Ilke
Öztekin1,
Lauren

McShane2, David Badre2; 1Koc University, 2Brown University — Proactive

interference (PI) occurs when prior learning interferes with memory performance and is a prime cause of forgetting. Cognitive control mechanisms, supported by ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), are crucial
for the resolution of PI. However, a key question concerns how the efficacy of cognitive control is evaluated and how adjustments are made to
control strategies depending on their outcome. Here, we manipulated
overt feedback under varying conditions of PI in order to investigate the
neural systems supporting evaluation and adjustment of interference
resolution strategies. Participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a short-term item recognition
task. Trials consisted of presentation of a 5-item study list, and a recognition probe following a distractor period. We progressively induced PI by
arranging trials such that consecutive study lists drew words from the
same semantic category. On accurate feedback blocks (AF), participants
were given correct feedback on their response. On false feedback blocks
(FF), participants were given inaccurate feedback half the time when
they correctly identified a studied item. Thus, the FF condition disproportionately punished retrieval strategies deployed to resolve PI. Providing AF compared to no-feedback (NF) increased memory
performance overall, but did not interact with the presence of PI. By contrast, FF selectively impacted PI conditions, eliminating the effect of PI
on performance and suggesting a shift in memory control strategy due to
outcome. Preliminary fMRI results indicate interactions between VLPFC
and the basal ganglia may be critical in evaluating and then adjusting
interference resolution strategies based on feedback conditions.

WORKING MEMORY PROCESSING FOR SIGN AND SPEECH IN BROCA’S
AREA Örjan Dahlström1, Ingrid Johnsrude1, Jerker Rönnberg1, Mary

Rudner1; 1Linnaeus Centre HEAD, Linköping University, Sweden — Working

memory (WM) for speech and sign language activates largely similar
neural networks. However, modality-specific processing differences
may be manifest in the anterior (Brodmann area, BA 45) and posterior
(BA 44) portions of Broca’s area. In BA 44, the longer duration of articulation for signs than words may be associated with higher WM activation for sign than speech and in BA 45 the smaller lexicon for signed than
spoken languages may be associated with higher activation for WM for
speech than sign. We tested this hypothesis in an event-related fMRI
experiment in which 13 hearing native signers performed 2-back tasks
based on speech and sign. Examined contrasts were Sign > Speech to
reveal net activation for WM for sign language, and Speech > Sign to
reveal net activation for WM for speech. Within the region of interest
(ROI), defined by Broca’s area, extended to control for individual functional variation, the mean of the y-coordinates (anterior-posterior axis) of
the most highly activated voxels occurring in each cluster of at least five
voxels was identified for each contrast and individual. A paired samples
t-test showed that mean peak activation in the Speech > Sign contrast
was more anterior than in the Sign > Speech contrast, t(10) = 1.92, p = .04
(one-tailed). This finding suggests that different WM processing
demands for sign and speech are reflected in differential neural substrates in Broca’s area.

LEVELS OF PROCESSING IN WORKING MEMORY FOR SIGNED AND
SPEECH-BASED LANGUAGE Mary Rudner1, Thomas Karlsson1, Jerker

Rönnberg1; 1Linköping University, Sweden — Working memory processing
and maintenance components are supported by a fronto-parietal network that is largely similar, yet subtly different, for signed and speechbased languages. We investigated for the first time modality-specific differences in the neural correlates of three different levels of processing
(semantic, phonological and orthographic) in working memory in 11
deaf early users of Swedish Sign Language and 19 hearing native Swedish speakers using a picture-based 2-back fMRI paradigm. Contrasts
between each of the processing levels and a 2-back, picture-based but
non-linguistic baseline condition activated distinct networks across
groups. For the semantic task, activation was found in right parahippocampal gyrus, insula and cerebellum, as well as left thalamus; for the phonological task in SMA, left cingulate and medial frontal gyri and right
caudate head; and for the orthographic task in left superior and middle
temporal gyri, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and insula as well
as lingual gyrus. All three contrasts interacted with group, showing differential activation in left hemisphere language areas. For the semantic
and orthographic tasks these included inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus and for the phonological task, the superior temporal
gyrus. This pattern suggests that different levels of linguistic processing
in working memory have different neural representations and that these
representations are partially modality specific. In particular, the posterior language area seems to be differentially engaged across language
modality at all three levels of working memory processing, while the
anterior language area is differentially engaged for semantic and orthographic but not phonological processing.

NO IDLING AT ALL: ALPHA OSCILLATIONS ENHANCED BY MEMORY LOAD

Wöstmann1, Nele Hellbernd1, Burkhard Maess1; 1Max Planck Institute for
Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany — Cortical
Alpha

oscillations (8–14 Hz) are no mere reflection of the “idling” brain:
Increased short-term memory load has been shown to particularly elicit
event-related Alpha synchronization (ERS). How specific to memory
load is this Alpha ERS? Is it prevalent in audition, and will additional
challenges to listeners, e.g. degraded speech, also elicit such enhanced
ERS? In an auditory Sternberg paradigm, we parametrically varied
memory load (set size of 2, 4, or 6 auditory presented digits) and signal
degradation (noise-vocoding in 16,8, or 4 bands) and measured the magnetoencephalographic response (N = 16; time–frequency analysis; gradiometer data; wavelet convolution; time–frequency–channel cluster
statistics using the Fieldtrip toolbox). In the retention interval, we found
a significant monotonic Alpha ERS at centro-parietal sensors, in two
additive main effects of set size (more memory load) and of degradation
(worse signal quality). No significant interaction was found. In 15 of 16
subjects, Alpha ERS during retention was positively correlated with the
reaction time effects observed in response to the ensuing probe digit
(mean Fisher-z = .46; slopes greater zero: p < 0.02). While the Alpha ERS
appears unspecifically modulated by both factors, a monotonic Beta (16–
24 Hz) desynchronization (ERD) was observed specifically for memory
load but not for degradation. Results suggest that enhanced alpha-band
synchronization indexes not only a memory-specific load but more
domain-independent challenges such as the acoustic degradation of the
speech signal. This bears relevance to and offers a new parameter to test
in the aging and hearing-impaired brain.

DISEMBODYING MEMORY: WHY ARE MEMORY CELLS TYPICALLY FOUND
IN PREFRONTAL CORTEX? Max Garagnani1, Friedemann Pulvermüller1;
1MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge (UK) — The

neurobiological basis of working memory has been elucidated by the discovery of
“memory cells”, neurons that exhibit several seconds of persistent activ-

160

ity when animals have to keep in mind stimulus information in view of
future action. These memory cells, and the corresponding neurometabolic changes in the human brain, are typically found in prefrontal cortex
and higher sensory areas, distant from primary cortices. However,
assuming that the formation of distributed memory circuits is the result
of correlated activity in motor and perceptual systems, why should these
circuits emerge far away from their antecedent activations in sensorimotor areas, leading to what could be called “disembodiment” of memory?
We use a six-area neuronal-network architecture (modelling primary
motor and sensory cortex, secondary and higher association areas in
frontal and temporal lobes) to simulate formation of memory circuits
and memory cells. The long-range, between-area connections implemented reflect known neuroanatomical links between corresponding
cortices. We report results in terms of recorded network activity at single-cell, circuit-, and area-specific level. Similarly to previous models, we
observed the spontaneous emergence of memory circuits (cell assemblies, CAs) and cells replicating various realistic behaviours. Due to the
intrinsic between-areas connectivity of the model, however, the formation of strong synaptic links holding the CA together was facilitated in
higher, associative (but not in primary) areas, leading to more memory
cells in prefrontal and anterior-temporal than in primary cortices. As
these findings answer the “where” question of cortical working memory
in terms of neuroanatomy, they further strengthen a distributed-network
memory account.

BRAIN TRAINING: DOES IT TRAIN THE BRAIN? THE NEURAL SUBSTRATES
UNDERLYING GAINS IN COGNITIVE CONTROL CAPACITY Susanne

Schweizer1, Jessica Grahn1, Adam Hampshire1, Dean Mobbs1, Christina
Asuquo-Brown2, Tim Dalgleish1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
2Maastricht University — Increasing popularity of so-called brain-training
has spurred research into improving cognitive control capacity (CCC),
which has been associated with successful academic/professional performance and greater well-being. Preliminary evidence suggests that
extensive training on complex working memory (WM) tasks can augment CCC. However, little is known about the neural substrates underlying “brain”-training gains. We aimed to investigate the reality of braintraining by exploring changes in neural functioning associated with
improved training performance and whether training translates to generalisable gains in CCC. 47 young adults were randomly assigned to a
neutral or affective dual n-back training (DnT) or a non-CCC-dependent
training control group. While all participants improved on their respective training tasks, only the DnT-groups showed transferable increases
in CCC, as measured by WM improvements on an untrained task. In line
with our understanding of the functional networks related to CCC, CCCgains were associated with greater activation decrease in posterior cingulate and parietal regions and with less increase in the anterior cingulate cortex. We further showed these CCC-improvements to extend
beyond the control of neutral information to the type of emotional information (words and faces) we process in everyday life. Improved behavioral control over emotional information also elicited greater activation
decreases in the right superior temporal regions and temporal pole.
These findings show that brain-training does indeed train the brain and
is associated with improved CCC, which optimizes functioning in our
emotionally-laden environment. This training then could ultimately benefit not only the healthy population but also individuals suffering from
anxiety or mood disorders.

Monday, April 4, 1:00 - 3:00 pm, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session F
in a range of other cognitive tasks and measures of intelligence. Often,
VSTM capacity is assessed using change detection tasks. Recently,
Cusack, Lehman, Veldsman and Mitchell (2009) found that an attentional component necessary for change detection and not memory capacity itself correlates with intelligence. It remained unclear, however, when
attentional control takes effect in change detection measures of shortterm memory, during encoding, maintenance or both. We have
addressed this question in two behavioural experiments and by conducting a meta-analysis of five imaging studies recently carried out in our
laboratory. In the first study, we showed that change detection performance of lower-IQ participants improved when they were encouraged
to adopt a more efficient attentional strategy. In the second study, we
found that capacity of participants with low change detection performance was significantly alleviated when they were provided with helpful grouping cues during encoding. Finally, a meta-analysis of
neuroimaging data from 112 participants performing a variety of visual
change detection tasks showed that performance correlates with activity
in several parietal and frontal regions during the encoding but not the
maintenance phase of the tasks. Taken together, these results suggest
that variations in VSTM capacity as assessed by change detection are primarily determined by differences in encoding strategy.

Biomedico, Rome, Italy, 5National Institute of Neuroscience, University of
Brescia, Italy — Transcranial magnetic stimulation and neuroimaging
data revealed parietal involvement during verbal working memory
(WM) with conflictive reports of increases or decreases in activation with
task practice. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the relative
function of the two cerebral hemispheres in maintenance and executive
processes of WM using bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS). We tested WM using a verbal n-back task (1-back and 2-back)
before and after tDCS. The results showed a double dissociation of WM
load effects induced by differential bilateral modulation. In the 1-back
task, there was a significant difference between sham and left anodalright cathodal modulation. Conversely, in the 2-back task, there was a
significant difference between sham and left cathodal-right anodal modulation. Interestingly, tDCS abolished the practice-dependent increase in
WM in both tasks. These findings demonstrated a differential parietal
involvement in verbal WM as a correlate of increased load, which may
reflect greater demand on storage, rehearsal, temporal coding and inhibition processes. These maintenance and executive processes may
account for the differences found between the two modulation conditions.

AMNESIA IMPAIRS MAINTENANCE OF A SINGLE FACE FOR JUST ONE
SECOND, UNLESS IT’S PARIS HILTON Nathan S. Rose1,2, Rosanna K.

Olsen1,2, Fergus I.M. Craik1,2, R. Shayna Rosenbaum1,3; 1Rotman Research
Institute, 2University of Toronto, 3York University — Recent research has demonstrated profound impairments in amnesics’ ability to maintain small
amounts of information (e.g., a single face) over very short retention
intervals (e.g., 1 second; Ezzyat & Olson, 2008). However, the types of
tasks that have demonstrated working memory impairments in amnesia
tend to have involved novel stimuli. One hypothesis is that short-term
memory is impaired in amnesia for tasks that require maintaining novel
information (Olson et. al., 2006; Jonides et. al, 2008), but may be preserved for more familiar material. To test this hypothesis, patient HC, a
22-year-old developmental amnesic with relatively preserved semantic
memory (Moses et al., 2008), and a group of matched controls performed
a delayed match-to-sample task which required maintaining a single
famous or nonfamous face for either 1 or 8 seconds. We made the faces

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

from photographs using FaceGenModeller software in order to exclude
salient features (e.g., hair, makeup, etc.). Lures were made by creating
perceptual morphs between the studied face and a different, non-studied
face. HC’s memory was impaired for nonfamous faces after both short
and long delays. However, HC’s performance was preserved for famous
faces at the short delay, but was worse than controls’ performance at the
longer delay. In addition, performance for all subjects was better for
famous than nonfamous faces. These results provide support for the
hypothesis that an intact hippocampus is required for remembering
novel information, even at very short delays, and stimulus familiarity
supports short-term memory via cortical regions outside of the medial
temporal lobe.

THE NEURAL BASIS OF WORKING MEMORY UPDATING: DISSOCIATING
LOCAL AND GLOBAL UPDATING Yoav Kessler1, Ronit Leibling-Milman1,
Morris Moscovitch1; 1Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Centre — Working

memory (WM) updating is composed of two sub-processes (Kessler &
Meiran, 2008). Local updating refers to the actual modification of the
updated items. It is followed by global updating, that binds together the
entire the content of WM, and acts on both the modified and unmodified
items. By using fMRI to investigate the brain structures that support
these processes, we hoped to provide further evidence for differentiation
between the two processes, and gain insight into the mechanisms that
underlie them. A version of the Sternberg task was used, in which the
participants were presented with sequences of screen, each containing 3
letters. After a random number of screens, a probe appeared and the participants had to indicate whether it was part of the last screen or not.
Importantly, each screen could be either identical to the previous one
(no-update), different in one of the item (1-update) or different in all the
3 items (3-update). Global updating, defined as the difference between
update (1-update and 3-update) and no-update, was associated with
activity in the left globus pallidus, supporting the role of basal ganglia as
a gating mechanism involved in WM updating, as well as the left inferior
frontal gyrus, right thalamus and left parahippocampal gyrus. The latter
supports the role of global updating in binding between WM items.
Local updating, defined as the difference between 3-update and 1update, was associated with activity in the left middle orbital gyrus. The
results provide further dissociation between local and global updating.

VISUAL AND AUDITORY WORKING MEMORY TRAINING LEAD TO

AS A SECOND LANGUAGE: AN FMRI STUDY Julia A. Schneiders1, Bertram

Opitz1, Christoph M. Krick2, Axel Mecklinger1; 1Saarland University, 2Saarland
University Hospital — Whereas previous research has shown a systematic

relationship between phonological working memory (WM) capacity and
second language proficiency for alphabetic languages, little is known
about the impact of WM on second language learning in Chinese. In this
training study we tested whether visual WM training, due to the greater
complexity of Chinese characters, has a greater impact on learning Chinese orthography, and, conversely, whether auditory WM training has a
stronger impact on learning Chinese phonology. Training induced modulations in language-related brain networks were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a pretest-posttest design. Both
WM trainings led to positive transfer effects on orthographic learning as
compared to no training, whereas for phonological learning no transfer
effects were obtained. For learning Chinese phonology decreased activity in the left insula was found after auditory training, whereas left
insula activation increased after visual training. Conversely, in the orthographic task there was an activation decrease in the left mid-fusiform
gyrus after visual training and an increase after auditory training. Moreover, visual training led to the additional recruitment of brain regions in
the orthographic task, i.e. the anterior part of the fusiform gyrus and the
right precuneus. This pattern of antipodal activation changes arose in
brain regions engaged in visual and auditory language processing. It
indicates that intra-modal WM training enhances the efficiency of visual

and auditory language processing areas (activation decreases), whereas
cross-modal WM training presumably facilitates flexible engagement of
those regions to enable the same performance level as after intra-modal
training.

Persson1; 1Department of Psychology, Stockholm Universitet & Stockholm
Brain Institute, 2Department of Integrative Medical Biology, Umeå University —
The dual mechanisms of control (DMC) (Braver et al., 1997) model is a
posited theoretical framework for understanding the dynamic nature of
human executive functions by invoking two dissociable cognitive control modes, proactive and reactive control. These may involve partially
overlapping, but temporally distinct neural implementation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Proactive control is utilized in situations defined by
high predictabiliy with respect to impending need for conflict resolution.
Reactive control is preferred in situations where it is difficult to foresee
when conflict will occur. Prior imaging studies of these dual control
mechanisms used variants of the AX-CPT paradigm, requiring subjects
to only respond ”yes” to the stimulus ’X’ if it is preceded by the stimulus
’A’ (AX trials) and to respond ”no” otherwise. Thus, very low demands
are imposed on proactive control only requiring information about single-items to be retained over unfilled delays. It however remains to be
elucidated whether proactive control can also facilitate performance in
more complex working memory tasks, in which concurrent processing
of intervening items and updating is mandatory during context maintenance. We used two variants of a verbal 3-back paradigm, one with predictive cue information embedded, to examine this issue. Performance
improved with trial-specific lure cues despite increasing cognitive load.
The temporal dynamics of right IFG activity indicated a flexible role in
high-interference resolution, with greater sustained responses elicited in
the 3-back task involving context maintenance of cue information and
greater transient responses elicited without it.

UPDATING SPATIAL REPRESENTATIONS IN WORKING MEMORY: AN
EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS STUDY Chui Luen Vera Hau1, Hoi-Chung

Leung1; 1Stony Brook University, SUNY — Directing spatial attention was
suggested as a possible mechanism for selective encoding and maintenance of visual stimuli in working memory (WM) to improve task performance. To directly investigate selective maintenance of spatial
representations in WM, we collected behavioral and event-related potentials (ERPs) data from 22 young adults using a delayed recognition paradigm with an updating cue presented after the presentation of a memory
array of 2 or 4 dot locations. We included two types of cues: a Memory
Selection (MS) cue (requiring reducing the memory set from 4 to 2 locations) and a Non-Selection (NS) cue (requiring continue holding of either
4 [NS4] or 2 [NS2] dot locations). Cue-related ERPs revealed two positive
components related to WM updating. ERP between 300-500ms was
larger in the NS4 than the MS and NS2 conditions (p<0.005), suggesting
selective retrieval of relevant target locations. ERP between 450-900ms
was larger in the MS than the NS conditions (p<0.005), suggesting labeling of target locations. Probe-related ERPs between 200-700ms of the MS
condition were comparable to the NS2 condition (p=.307) and more positive than the NS4 condition (p<.001 and p<.05, respectively). This latter
finding corroborates with the behavioral benefit observed for the MS
condition, of which the average reaction times in correspondence to
probe recognition was comparable to the NS2 condition (p=.393) but
shorter than that of the NS4 condition (ps<.001). Our data suggest that
the updating cue facilitates selective spatial information processing manifested in behavior and modulates neural activity during post-cue delay
and probe recognition.

present study investigated the
impact of acute mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the neural circuitry
of working memory (WM). Eight controls and 6 patients (1 month post
injury) were enrolled in the study. We administered a block-design nback WM task with 3 memory load conditions. fMRI was acquired on a
3T GE scanner. All image processing was performed using SPM8. In the
0-back condition, relative to healthy controls, mild TBI patients demonstrated decreased activation in right precentral and right superior temporal gyri. Patients showed significantly lower activation in left
supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, cuneus, middle temporal
gyrus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in response to the 1-back condition. In response to the 2-back condition, patients exhibited hypoactivation in the left insula, in addition to the hypoactivated regions found in
the 1-back condition. Comparison of the 2-back condition to the 0-back
condition revealed patients’ hypoactivations in left SMA, left insula, left
orbitofrontal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus and middle temporal
gyrus. Hypoactivations in the 0-back condition suggest that mild TBI
patients’ attention was significantly affected. Lower activations in
VLPFC and temporal gyri in conditions with higher memory loads may
suggest affected verbal memory responses to the language-related stimuli in the WM task. In general, acute mild TBI patients may have worse
attentional support, verbal memory and self-monitoring than controls in
response to high WM loads.

is a multivariate analysis of the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm
(SIRP) for working memory (WM), with manipulation of the duration of
the delay epoch (0, 2, and 4s). This manipulation greatly facilitates mapping neural networks to WM stages (encoding, delay and probe),
because distinct hemodynamic response shapes are expected for all possible combinations of the three task stages. Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA) was applied, which allows
estimation of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) associated with
each network, instead of that associated with individual regions (the latter being the product of univariate analyses). The results identified three
networks involved in WM. The first was involved in encoding and probe
only, and was dominated by visual cortex regions. The second was
involved in the probe period only, and was dominated by dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex, insula, basal ganglia, and sensorimotor cortex. The
third was involved in encoding and delay, and was dominated by activation in V1, and deactivation in the superior temporal and left supramarginal gyrus. This set of regions replicates the networks discovered
previous multivariate work on working memory, but allowed more precise assignment of each network to WM task stages.

individual brain regions as well as how multiple regions form a network
supporting WM maintenance processes. Given methodological limitations with fMRI, it has been particularly difficult to investigate network

interactions during WM maintenance processes. Thus, we employed a
task with a long retention period and precisely controlled rehearsal processes. This allowed differentiation of different time courses of responses
from individual brain regions (transient vs. sustained) as well as assessment of their interactions during WM maintenance. During fMRI scanning, participants (n=19) were presented with either three or five letters
that they were instructed to maintain over a forty-five second delay
period. To ensure rehearsal during the entire delay period, a repeating
visual pacing cue prompted them to subvocally rehearse each letter.
Results revealed that prefrontal and parietal cortex exhibit transient
responses consistent with a role in “control” processes, while Sylvianparietal-temporal (Spt) and motor/pre-motor areas exhibited sustained
responses consistent with a role in “storage” processes. Significant functional connectivity was observed in these frontal, parietal and temporal
regions during WM maintenance, with individual regions exerting influence on other connected regions. These data support the idea that verbal
WM arises from nodal interactions within a fronto-parietal-temporal network, and that individual network nodes support different WM component processes.

MEMORY
MAINTENANCE Kartik K. Sreenivasan1, Caterina Gratton1, Jason J. Vytlacil1,

Mark D'Esposito1; 1University of California, Berkeley — An emerging view is
that visual working memory (WM) maintenance is instantiated via preferentially weighted activity in extrastriate cortex (EC) neurons that form
percepts of the maintained item. While EC neurons are thought to retain
information about the memory item, it is not known whether these neurons code for specific feature values during WM maintenance. Furthermore, the top-down sources that maintain preferential weighting in EC
have yet to be elucidated. We conducted an fMRI study in which subjects
viewed a series of faces and indicated whether each face matched a Target face held in WM. A morphing procedure created a set of Non-Target
faces that varied parametrically in the degree of visual features they
shared with the Target face. We hypothesized that if EC neurons code
for specific feature values, then maintaining the Target in WM would
bias EC activity in favor of neurons that code for the features of the Target face. Accordingly, we found that activity elicited by Non-Target faces
in face-selective regions within EC scaled linearly with the degree of
overlap between Target and Non-Target features. A seed-based functional connectivity analysis identified areas within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and basal ganglia as being functionally coupled to EC.
This pattern of results (i) supports the notion that EC contributes to WM
maintenance via preferential activity in neuronal populations that code
for features of memory items, and (ii) suggests that basal ganglia and

INTACT VISUAL WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY AFTER MEDIAL

Hopkins2,3, Larry Squire1,4; 1University of California, San Diego, 2Brigham
Young University, 3Intermountain Medical Center, Utah, 4Veterans Affairs
Medical Center, San Diego — Patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL)

damage are sometimes impaired at remembering visual information
across delays as short as a few seconds (e.g., 3 colored squares after 4 seconds; Olson et al., 2006). Such impairments could reflect impaired visual
working memory (VWM) capacity or an impairment in long-term memory (because attention has been diverted or working memory capacity
has been exceeded). We asked whether MTL damage impairs or spares
VWM capacity. We tested patients with bilateral hippocampal lesions
and one patient with large MTL lesions on a change-detection task modeled after Luck and Vogel (1997). Participants saw an array of 1, 2, 3, 4 or
6 colored squares, followed by a second array with one of the colored
squares marked by a cue. The second array was presented after a blank
retention interval of 1, 3, 4 or 8 seconds. The task was to decide whether

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

the cued square had the same color as the corresponding square in the
first array or a different color. At the 1 s delay (typically used to assess
VWM capacity), patients performed as well as controls at all array sizes.
Performance was nearly perfect for array sizes of 1, 2, and 3 items, and
then at larger array sizes declined similarly for patients and controls. At
longer delays, patients performed as well as controls at the smaller array
sizes and worse than controls at the larger array sizes. The findings suggest that VWM capacity is intact after MTL damage.

HIGH WORKING MEMORY IS ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONGER CONFLICT
ADAPTATION EFFECT Maria Kharitonova1, Tim Curran1, Yuko Munakata1;
1University of Colorado at Boulder — What

is the role of working memory
(WM) in the ability to regulate cognitive control? We postulate that high
WM capacity should be associated with dynamic changes in cognitive
control strategies, based on task demands. We tested this theory by measuring the magnitude of the conflict adaptation effect in the Flanker task,
where participants need to respond to the direction of a central arrow,
which can be flanked by arrows pointing in the same direction (congruent trials) or in the opposite direction (incongruent trials). We assessed
WM capacity based on performance in an ERP-based visuospatial working memory task (as in Vogel et al., 2005). All participants showed the
conflict adaptation effect, such that they were faster on incongruent trials
that followed incongruent trials (II trials) than on incongruent trials that
followed congruent trials (CI trials). These sequential effects are typically
interpreted in terms of conflict-driven adjustments in cognitive control
(e.g. Egner, 2007). Consistent with our predictions, high WM was associated with greater conflict adaptation, such that II trials were performed
faster by high WM participants than low WM participants, when controlling for CI RTs. Conversely, CI trials were performed slower by high
WM participants than low WM participants, when controlling for II trial
RTs. Thus, high WM predicted a sharper contrast between the two types
of trial sequences and was therefore associated with greater dynamic
adjustments in cognitive control, based on preceding task demands.

COMPUTATIONAL MECHANISMS OF SCALAR VALUE REPRESENTATION
IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX Ashley N. Cline1, Jeremy R. Reynolds1,
Randall C. O'Reilly2; 1University of Denver, 2University of Colorado, Boulder —

The ability to maintain scalar values over a delay is critical for various
functions such as value comparison and time discrimination. However,
this ability is notoriously problematic to accomplish for many biologically plausible neural network approaches. The current study investigates how interactions between the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia
may produce the ability to maintain scalar values, and how such PFCmediated scalar value representations may be developed via experience.
We model a task in which a base scalar value (e.g. frequency of tactile
stimulation) is presented and then removed. After an empty delay, a
comparison value is presented, and the subject must determine whether
that comparison value is higher or lower than the base value. This paradigm has well characterized psychophysical and neural profiles (Hernandez, et al, 1997; Romo et al, 1999). The framework used to model this
task is the prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia working memory (PBWM)
model developed by O’Reilly & Frank (2006), in which areas of PFC are
associated with corresponding areas of the basal ganglia, and these
“stripes” learn to appropriately update and maintain information based
on their previous history of reinforcement. This framework is shown to
be capable of processing scalar values by replicating psychophysical performance characterized by Hernandez et al (1997) and neurophysiological correlates examined by Romo et al (1999). Further analysis of the
activity patterns in the model revealed several novel predictions relating
to the identification of non-monotonic tuning curves and the distributed
patterns of activity over the delay period.

ANTICIPATORY SPECTRAL ACTIVITY DURING SPATIAL AND NON-SPATIAL
AUDITORY WORKING MEMORY TASKS Saskia Helbling1, Maria Rieder1,

Benjamin Rahm1,2, Christoph Polkowski1, Michael Wibral1, Jochen Kaiser1;
1Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany, 2Gutenberg University, Mainz,
Germany — Previous studies have found task-specific gamma-band activity (GBA) in auditory ventral and dorsal pathways during working
memory tasks based on auditory pattern and spatial information, respectively. Here we used magnetoencephalography to explore the role of
GBA as a correlate of anticipatory processes during auditory spatial and
non-spatial tasks. In a delayed match-to-sample task, sample sounds
were characterized by both a variable interaural time delay and a variable central frequency. To investigate task-specific anticipatory activity
we assessed the preparatory phase prior to the sample stimuli. At sensor
level, comparison with a passive listening condition revealed pronounced beta synchronization at central sensors for both tasks. Frequency-domain beamforming located this activity in motor cortex
suggesting a sustained beta-rebound following the motor response given
in the two active tasks. Lower GBA at posterior sensors was found during the lateralization task compared to the passive listening condition.
The sources of this gamma decrease were located in the right cerebellum.
Statistical comparisons in source space indicated that the frequency task
led to higher gamma activity in the right cerebellum than the lateralization task. The cerebellum has been linked to the processing, discrimination and anticipation of sensory input, as well as to auditory working
memory. Furthermore, we found differences between both tasks in areas
previously linked to spatial and non-spatial auditory processing, i.e. the
right temporal lobe, the parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex.

IS PRESSURE STRESSFUL? THE IMPACT OF PRESSURE ON STRESS
REACTIVITY AND CATEGORY LEARNING Steve Hutchinson1, Brandon
Cosley1, Shannon McCoy1, Shawn Ell1,2; 1Department of Psychology, University
of Maine, 2Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences — Recent research

in cognitive neuroscience has shown that pressure may impair or
enhance learning depending upon the cognitive system mediating task
performance. The physiological mechanisms by which pressure may
mediate these effects are unclear. Given that pressure is so often associated with stress, the focus of the current study is whether pressure might
lead to increased stress reactivity? To investigate this question, we used
a pressure manipulation that has been shown to impair accuracy on a
rule-based category learning task (i.e., learning depends primarily upon
a hypothesis-testing system) and to enhance accuracy on an informationintegration category learning task (i.e., learning depends primarily upon
a procedural-based memory system). Pressure was increased by informing participants that they (and a fictitious partner) would be eligible for a
monetary bonus only if they achieved a criterion accuracy level (which
the fictitious partner had already achieved). Behaviorally, increased
pressure impaired accuracy on the rule-based task, but had no affect on
accuracy on the information-integration task. Physiologically, pressure
led to a modest increase in arousal (i.e., heart rate) on the rule-based task
only. For these participants, a pattern of stress reactivity that is physiologically and psychologically adaptive was associated with higher accuracy. These data suggest that pressure may not necessarily be stressful.
Moreover, these data highlight the importance of considering variability
in the stress response in understanding the stress-cognition relationship.

suggests that neurocognitive differences between chemotherapy patients
and healthy controls may exist even before chemotherapy has begun

164

(Cimprich et al., 2009). The present experiment expands previous work
by comparing cognitive function in women with breast cancer scheduled
for treatment with and without chemotherapy. Three groups (n=20 per
group) were compared: pre-chemotherapy patients, pre-radiation therapy patients, and controls without breast cancer. Participants were
assessed using fMRI while completing a verbal working memory task
(VMT). On each VMT trial, participants indicated whether a presented
probe letter was part of the current trial's memory set. Performance and
brain activation in predetermined regions of interest, including inferior
frontal gyrus (IFG), were compared for trials on which the current probe
was not presented in the memory sets of the past few trials (low
demand) and trials on which the current probe was presented in the previous trial’s memory set (high demand). Pre-chemotherapy patients
were less accurate than controls on the VMT (p=.05). Pre-radiation
patients showed accuracy levels between those of the pre-chemotherapy
and control groups. Control and pre-radiation groups selectively
increased recruitment of left IFG in response to high versus low demand
trials. However, pre-chemotherapy patients showed bilateral recruitment, with no significant difference in activation of left versus right IFG.
These results suggest neurocognitive disruptions in breast cancer begin
even before chemotherapy. Patients may attempt to compensate for
these declines by increasing bilateral recruitment of frontal control
regions.

WORKING MEMORY TRAINING IN TYPICALLY DEVELOPING CHILDREN
AND CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER –
EVIDENCE FOR PLASTICITY IN EXECUTIVE CONTROL PROCESSES

Susanne Jaeggi1, Martin Buschkuehl1, John Jonides1, Priti Shah1; 1The
University of Michigan — We trained typically developing children (N=62)
as well as children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD; N=44, data collection ongoing) on a motivating working memory game for 4 weeks. Before and after training, the children were tested
on a non-trained WM task and on an executive control task that is a common marker for ADHD, the continuous performance task. We compared
the WM training groups’ improvements on those transfer tasks to
improvements of control groups who practiced a general knowledge and
vocabulary game for the same duration as the experimental groups. Our
results show that for both the healthy and the ADHD children, working
memory training is more effective than the control training in improving
the transfer measures of working memory and executive control. The
improvements are primarily based on reductions in errors of commission; a result which is of particular relevance for the children with
ADHD. We conclude that our working memory game is an effective
intervention for children with and without deficits in working memory
and executive control. The ongoing data collection and follow-up assessments will establish whether and how long the transfer effects last.

COMMON PARIETAL RESPONSES DURING WORKING AND LONG-TERM
MEMORY TASKS Marian Berryhill1; 1University of Nevada, Reno — Two
traditionally separate literatures study the role of parietal regions in
memory. In the long-term memory (LTM) literature parietal activations
are often linked with memory retrieval, e.g. the ‘parietal old/new effect’.
Greater parietal activity is observed after endorsing an item perceived as
‘old’ in contrast to rejecting an item as ‘new’. In the working memory
(WM) literature, parietal activations are associated with phonological
and visuospatial maintenance processes. There is striking resemblance
between the parietal activations observed in WM and LTM tasks, but
these separate literatures required comparisons across research groups,
scanners and experimental methods. Here, we employed a within-subjects design to ask: Are there common parietal activations during WM
and LTM tasks? We used event-related functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) to identify the conjunction of activity for the WM and
LTM tasks. We selected a standard verbal LTM list-learning task and a
visuospatial WM change-blindness task. These tasks were deliberately
selected to use distinct stimuli (verbal, visual) so that any conjoint activa-

tions could not be attributed to stimulus processing. The results from fifteen healthy young adults revealed dorsal stream clusters in the
intraparietal sulcus that were significantly activated by both the WM
and LTM tasks. These data confirm that not only is the parietal lobe
active during various forms of memory, but the same regions are
involved in both WM and LTM.

COGNITIVE AND EEG CHANGES FOLLOWING SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS
STIMULATION: A CASE STUDY Katherine Selzler1, Michelle Burack1, David

Loiselle1, Jonathan Mink1, Mark Mapstone1; 1University of Rochester — Deep

brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an accepted
treatment for Parkinson’s disease (PD) motor disability. The therapeutic
effect of DBS may be related to disruption of pathological beta synchrony thought to underlie PD motor features. We and others have previously shown that in addition to improving motor function, STN DBS
can negatively affect working memory in some patients. In this case
study, we use EEG to link DBS-related cortical changes to our cognitive
and motor outcomes. We collected 32-channel continuous EEG while a
non-medicated 54-year old male PD subject was at rest, or performed
working memory or finger tapping tasks. We recorded EEG with DBS
ON and OFF in the same testing visit. We applied a band pass filter (0.5 –
100Hz) to eliminate the fundamental stimulation frequency (130Hz). The
subject showed a load dependent deficit in working memory performance, but improvement in motor speed with DBS. DBS produced an
overall reduction in synchrony (power) at most frequency bands in the
resting EEG. EEG collected during task performance revealed little DBSrelated change in activity at any frequency during the finger tapping
task, but marked de-synchronization of theta and alpha activity during
the working memory task. Oscillatory activity in the theta band is
known to be important for working memory (Onton et al, 2004). DBSrelated disruption of pathological beta synchrony in PD patients may
lead to motor improvement, while disruption of normal theta activity
may underlie the working memory deficits seen in some patients.

RELATING INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SHORT-TERM MEMORYDERIVED EEG TO COGNITIVE TRAINING EFFECTS Bornali
Kundu1,

Bradley R. Postle1; 1Neuroscience Training Program, University of Wisconsin,
Madison — Voltage (i.e., ERP) measures of the delay-period during a
working memory (WM) task show considerable individual differences
that correlate with memory span. We have also shown that individual
differences in spectral measures of delay-period EEG activity are stable
and trait-like. In this study we explored the relationship between delayperiod spectral power (DPSP) and WM training. Prolonged, adaptive
training on WM tasks improves performance on the task itself, as well as
on nonmnemonic tests of general fluid intelligence (gF), with the largest
gains seen in low gF individuals (Jaeggi et al., 2008). Prior to beginning
training, we measured DPSP for each subject, then divided subjects into
experimental and control groups. The experimental group trained on a
dual n-back task 40 minutes per day, 5 times per week, for 4 weeks. The
control group trained on a task without overt memory demands (Tetris).
For this group, there was no relation between DPSP and training-related
improvement on the control task. In the experimental group, greater
improvement on the training task was seen in the subjects with greater
DPSP in the theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-14Hz), and gamma (25-50Hz) bands.
No such relation was observed for DPSP in the beta (15-25Hz) band.
These results suggest that individual differences in DPSP may predict
amenability to cognitive training. This approach, in turn, suggests a way
that training might be used to investigate the functions of discrete frequency bands in DPSP.

BRAIN REGIONS UNDERLYING VERBAL SHORT-TERM MEMORY:
EVIDENCE FROM VOXEL-BASED LESION SYMPTOM MAPPING Juliana

Baldo1, Shira Katseff1,2, Nina Dronkers1,2,3; 1Veterans Affairs Northern

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

California Health Care System, 2University of California, Berkeley, 3University of
California, Davis, 4University of California, San Diego — Verbal
short-term
memory (STM) is often tested by immediate repetition/recall of auditory-verbal information. A number of functional imaging studies of verbal STM with normal participants have implicated a left hemisphere
network of regions, including inferior frontal and posterior temporal/
inferior parietal cortex. Case studies of neurologic patients have provided evidence of cognitive dissociations with respect to STM and its
putative components; however, less emphasis has been placed on anatomic localization in these cases. In the current study, we used a relatively new technique, voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM),
which allowed us to identify brain regions critically involved in verbal
STM on a voxel-by-voxel basis in a large group of 82 left hemisphere
stroke patients. Several different behavioral measures were administered, including repetition of words, pseudowords, and digits. The
VLSM analyses revealed that overall STM performance was associated
with left temporo-parietal cortex, with the maximal t-value centered in
the left superior temporal gyrus (MNI coordinates -62, -42, 22). STM for
single words was also associated with left temporo-parietal cortex, while
STM for pseudowords showed a more extensive network of significant
voxels, with the maximal t-value at the border of the superior temporal
gyrus and inferior parietal cortex. STM for digits showed dependence on
voxels primarily in left middle and superior temporal gyri. These data
suggest that while a network of left hemisphere regions is recruited in
normal STM, posterior regions in left superior temporal/inferior parietal
cortex are most critical for immediate STM and represent a likely locus of
the phonological store.

FLEXIBLE HUBS: GLOBAL BRAIN CONNECTIVITY CORRELATES OF
HUMAN INTELLIGENCE Michael Cole1, Todd Braver1; 1Washington
University in St. Louis — Cognitive flexibility is the hallmark of human
intelligence. We hypothesized that this flexibility emerges from extensive global brain connectivity (GBC) in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC),
allowing LPFC to respond to a wide variety of brain states with a wide
variety of possible control signals. We used resting state functional connectivity MRI with a large dataset (N=96) to test for a region within
LPFC showing high global brain connectivity (GBC) correlating with
individual differences in general fluid intelligence (gF). We found that
the identified LPFC region is one of the most highly connected brain
regions (i.e., a hub), and that its activity predicts performance on the Nback task. Importantly, we found that despite this region’s inclusion as
part of the cognitive control network (CCN), gF was best predicted by its
connectivity with regions outside the CCN. These findings support our
hypothesis that LPFC’s high GBC supports the high cognitive flexibility
central to human intelligence.

"WHAT" AND "WHERE" AUDITORY PATHWAYS INFLUENCED BY
BILINGUALISM AND MUSIC EXPERIENCES Sylvain Moreno1,2, Ada

Leung1, Ellen Bialystok1,2, Claude Alain1; 1Rotman Research Institute &
University of Toronto, 2York University — Bilinguals and musicians have been

shown to perform better than monolinguals in executive function, memory and working memory tasks. For bilinguals, these findings have been
attributed to their need to manage attention to two languages that are
jointly available during linguistic performance. For musicians, these
findings have been attributed to their training requirements. To further
explore these effects of experiences, we tested 30 young adults who were
either English monolinguals, bilinguals, or monolingual musicians while
they performed an auditory N-back task with two conditions (category
type and stimuli location - using the same stimuli). Our hypothesis was
that music will rely on the “What” system because of the verbal advantage of musicians and the brain areas stimulated by musical training
whereas bilingualism will relate to the “Where” system because of bilingual advantages in non-verbal tasks and the brain areas stimulated by
bilingualism. Results showed a main effect of group, with greater activa-

tion in musicians than in bilinguals in the Heschl gyrus, Precuneus and
LIFG. Results also showed a similar activation in the Right superior frontal gyrus between musicians and bilinguals but greater in monolinguals.
There was an interaction between Group and Condition; for the category
condition, there was greater activation for musicians than monolinguals
in LIFG whereas for the location condition there was greater activation
for bilinguals than monolinguals in LIFG too. The findings demonstrate
how experiences differentially shaped the brain at the functional level
and how similar behavioral performance could be achieved involving
different brain networks.

DIFFERENT NETWORKS AND CAPACITY LIMITS FOR ARTICULATORY AND
NON-ARTICULATORY MECHANISMS OF VERBAL SHORT-TERM
MEMORY Sabrina Trapp1, Karsten Mueller1, Stephan Konrad1, Jöran
Lepsien1, Bernd Krämer2, Oliver Gruber1,2; 1Max Planck Institute for Human
Cognitive and Brain Sciences, 2Georg August University Goettingen — It
is

assumed that maintenance in verbal short-term memory (STM) is accomplished by means of vocal or subvocal rehearsal (Baddeley, 1986).
Recently, attention as an alternative mechanism to refresh memory
traces has been discussed intensively (Barrouillet et al., 2004; Gruber &
Goschke, 2004; Raye et al., 2007). While the capacity of verbally
rehearsed information is thought to span the amount of material that can
be articulated in 2 s (Baddeley et al., 1975), attentional refreshing seems
to be limited to the amount of objects that can be maintained in the focus
of attention, usually estimated to about four items (Cowan, 2001). In this
fMRI study, we directly contrasted the processing capacity of STM with
and without subvocal rehearsal by varying the amount of load for each
memory condition. Subjects memorized either three, six or eight in the
articulatory rehearsal and three or six letters in the non-articulatory
maintenance condition. The results show that key nodes of the articulatory-rehearsal network parametrically increase activation with the
amount of memorized information. In contrast, we found evidence for
an off-level of neural activity after three items for the network underlying non-articulatory maintenance of phonological information. Moreover, in supra-capacity condition, the articulatory-based network
additionally recruited key nodes of the non-articulatory, presumably
attention-related network. This study yields further support for a dissociation between two different neural networks for verbal STM based on
their processing capacities, informs about potential compensatory mechanisms with information overload and supports previous proposals on
the limited focus of attention.

EFFECTS OF THETA BURST STIMULATION OF MIDDLE FRONTAL GYRUS
AND INFERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE ON LOAD AND FILTERING PROCESSES
IN SPATIAL WORKING MEMORY Peter A Butcher1, Richard B Ivry1;

1
Department of Psychology, UC Berkeley — The exclusion of task-irrelevant
information from working memory has been associated with activation
in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and basal ganglia (McNab, 2007). In
contrast, activation in right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) is associated
with WM load. To further explore these hypotheses, we disrupted MFG
and IPL in the right hemisphere with offline theta burst stimulation
(TBS). On each trial, subjects viewed a display of 14 squares arranged
along a virtual circle about a fixation point. Three different conditions
were verbally cued for each trial. Low Load: Four red circles indicated
possible target location. High Load: Memory load was increased to six
items, 4 red and 2 yellow circles. Filter: 4 red and 2 yellow circles were
presented but yellow circles were ignored. After a delay, a probe
appeared and participants indicated if it was one of the target locations.
While TBS to rMFG and rIPL produced minimal change in load cost
(Low-High) or filter cost (Low-Filter), there was a change in the correlation pattern of the two measures across individuals. The measures were
strongly correlated following control stimulation. Following TBS to
either area, these correlations were reduced for contralateral targets, but
remained unchanged for ipsilateral targets. Thus, while TBS of either

166

region affected performance for contralateral targets, we did not observe
dissociable contributions of MFG and IPL to spatial WM.

INCREASING VISUAL WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY WITH
TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION Philip Tseng1,2, Tzu-Yu
Hsu2, Ovid Tzeng2, Daisy Hung2, Chi-Hung Juan2; 1University of California,
Santa Cruz, 2National Central University, Taiwan — The limited capacity of

visual working memory (VWM) has been well documented. This limit in
capacity has also been found to be highly predictive of individual differences in fluid intelligence. Neuroimaging studies have pointed to the
posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the neural locus of VWM as its activity
is positively correlated with working memory load and reaches an
asymptotic neural activity level right around 3~4 items, perfectly reflecting the capacity limit of VWM in human performance. Although PPC
activity has been proven critical to VWM performance, it has never been
shown whether humans can increase VWM capacity by pushing PPC
activity higher. Here we show that increasing right PPC activity via the
use of direct transcranial current stimulation can indeed improve people’s VWM capacity. We found that people were able to hold more items
in their VWM and improve their performance instantly and effortlessly.
Furthermore, although individual differences existed in our sample,
nearly everyone was able to benefit from the electrical stimulation
regardless of their baseline performance. These results suggest that
VWM capacity is not fixed, and can be readily improved with external
neural stimulation or perhaps long-term behavioral practices that targets
PPC activity.

ATTENTION NEEDS TIME TO SHIFT BETWEEN ITEMS IN WORKING
MEMORY Ryan Tanoue1, Dwight Peterson1, Kevin Jones1, Marian Berryhill1;

1
University of Nevada, Reno — Attention enhances perceptual processing,
but it also enhances processing of items encoded in working memory
(WM). This happens when you are looking for something and you realize you passed it three drawers ago. The retro-cue paradigm serves as a
window into attentional operations within WM. Stimuli are presented
and after encoding a cue indicates the to-be-probed item. A post-cue
delay duration follows cue presentation and next, participants judge
whether a probe is old or new. A retro-cue benefit emerges (5-10%) when
comparing valid and neutral retro-cues. How this benefit occurs is mysterious since no new information becomes available. We investigated
two hypotheses: prioritization (cues reshuffle the WM-probe comparison
order) and protection (cued item is preserved, other WM contents are
ejected). Prioritization predicts that greater post-cue delays should
reduce the retro-cue benefit, whereas protection predicts no change in
the retro-cue benefit. In Experiment 1, we found that increasing the delay
between cue and test actually enhanced the retro-cue effect. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding and also found that invalid cues did
not cause a retro-cue deficit. In Experiment 3, we used a double retro-cue
paradigm where the second cue could countermand or confirm the first
cue. The data reveal that the retro-cue benefit remained when the second
cue countermanded the first. These data lead us to propose a modified
protection account in which protection of the cued item develops over
time and memory representations of uncued items are maintained and
not ejected from WM.

THE ROLE OF FRONTAL EYE FIELDS IN SPATIAL WORKING MEMORY AND
J.
ATTENTION: A CONCURRENT TMS-FMRI APPROACH Alexander

Shackman1, Yelena Guller1, Adam C. Riggall1, Jeffrey S. Johnson1, Bradley R.
Postle1; 1University of Wisconsin-Madison — Working memory allows

organisms to retain information when it is no longer present, facilitating
goal-directed behavior. A central question concerns the mechanisms
underlying the maintenance of locations in spatial WM (SWM). This is
putatively accomplished via covert shifts of spatial selective attention
(SSA) to memorized locations, manifesting as sustained excitation of the
corresponding regions of visual cortex (VC). Although the source of sus-

Monday, April 4, 1:00 - 3:00 pm, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session F
tained VC excitation remains unclear, several lines of evidence suggest
that reentrant signals from the frontal eye fields (FEF) could contribute.
First, microstimulation experiments in monkeys and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies in humans suggest that the influence of
SSA on VC reflects biasing signals from FEF. Second, FEF itself exhibits
sustained activity during tasks requiring the maintenance of locations.
To more directly probe task-dependent functional coupling between FEF
and VC, we delivered single-pulse TMS to right FEF during the performance of lateralized SWM (delayed-recognition) and SSA (target-detection) tasks in 10 participants (6 male; M=20.3 years). Concurrent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure the
task-dependent propagation of TMS-evoked impulses to VC. Absent
TMS, both tasks activated contralateral VC. FEF was independently
identified using a saccade/anti-saccade task. Analyses revealed bilateral
activation near the superior frontal and precentral sulci in all participants. VC regions (V1-V4) were independently identified by mapping
visual eccentricity/angle onto single-subject cortical flat-maps. Using
these functionally-derived regions, we were able to discriminate the
propagation of FEF stimulation to regions of VC that matched memorized (SWM) or attended (SSA) locations from those that did not.

OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID SUPPLEMENTATION AND COGNITION IN A
COLLEGE-AGED POPULATION: A RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED,
DOUBLE-BLIND PILOT STUDY Justin Karr1, Tyler Grindstaff1, Joel

Alexander1; 1Western Oregon University — With increasing awareness of
nutritional influences on physical and mental health, researchers have
further investigated the benefits of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(n-3 PUFA) on health and the brain; however, these benefits remain
unclear across different age groups. The research suggests that n-3 PUFA
positively affect prenatal neurodevelopment; however, this cognitiveenhancing effect might diminish postnatally with maturation. Thereafter, few studies have examined n-3 PUFA and cognition from childhood
to middle-age, cohorts requiring further investigation. At later age, n-3
PUFA appears protective against neurodegeneration. The current study
used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design for three
weeks of n-3 PUFA supplementation (200 mg EPA/200 mg DHA) compared to a coconut oil placebo on 20 college students. Participants underwent baseline and post-supplementation assessments through the Rey
Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Stroop Test, and Trail Making Test.
Across all measures, the researchers hypothesized greater improvement
in the above assessments among the n-3 PUFA group compared to placebo group. A series of two-way ANOVAs indicated that n-3 PUFA supplemented participants (n=10) did not differ from placebo-condition
participants (n=10) in their improvement from baseline across all measures, possibly indicating n-3 PUFA as ineffective at improving cognition in college-aged populations; however, a larger sample must be
tested in order to verify this claim.

NEURODEVELOPMENTAL CORRELATES OF ENCODING PROCESSES
UNDERLYING FALSE-MEMORY FORMATION Pedro M. Paz-Alonso1, Emily

Hembacher2, Pamela Gallego2, Simona Ghetti2; 1BCBL, Basque Center on
Cognition, Brain and Language, Spain, 2University of California, Davis — The
Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm is frequently used to
examine true and false memories. After studying lists of semantically
associated words, participants respond to a recognition test that includes
studied items (targets), non-studied semantic associates (critical lures),
and new unrelated items (distracters). Adults typically falsely recognize
lures as frequently as they correctly recognize previously studied targets; both true and false recognition increase during middle childhood.
Recent findings indicated that developmental improvements in semantic
processing during encoding may underlie these behavioral trends in the
DRM paradigm lists. The present mixed block/event-related fMRI study
was aimed at investigating developmental correlates of brain activation
associated with encoding processes of high and low associative strength
lists in 8- to 9-year-old children (n = 16) and adults (n =15). During scanning, participants studied 18 auditorily presented DRM lists (9 of High
associative strength and 9 of Low associative strength). Then, they performed a yes/no recognition test including targets, critical lures, and distracters. Across age groups, true and false recognition were higher for
High- compared to Low-Associative strength lists. Also, compared to
adults, children exhibited fewer hits and false recognition of critical
lures, but more false recognition of distracters. Neuroimaging results
revealed that temporal regions and dlPFC were implicated in semantic
processing of High versus Low association strength lists, and that these
regions were more strongly recruited in adults relative to children. Our
findings underscore neurodevelopmental changes in key regions leading
to false-memory formation during encoding processes.

NEURAL BASIS OF IMPLICIT ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING AND AGING

3Department of Psychology, Catholic University of America, 4Department of
Neurology, Georgetown University — Few studies have investigated how
aging influences the neural basis of implicit associative learning (IAL)
and available evidence is inconclusive. One emerging behavioral pattern
is that age differences in learning increase with practice, perhaps reflecting the involvement of different brain regions with training. Studies
show that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) governs responding early on,
whereas learning is increasingly dependent on the striatum throughout
practice. We propose that the balance of these interactive learning systems changes with age, due to greater age-related striatal vs. MTL
declines. We assessed age-related differences in brain activation during

168

IAL using the Triplets Learning Task. Over 3 event-related fMRI runs, 11
young and 12 healthy older adults responded to only the third (target)
stimulus in sequences of three stimuli by corresponding keypress. Unbeknownst to participants, the first stimulus’ location predicted one target
location for 80% of trials (High-Probability) and another target location
for 20% of trials (Low-Probability). Both age groups learned associative
regularities, but age differences in favor of the young emerged with
practice. Using SPM5, the neural basis of learning was examined by contrasting regions more active on High- relative to Low-Probability trials
and vice versa. Both age groups engaged the MTL early, but with training the young recruited their striatum whereas the old continued to rely
on their MTL. This pattern enables old to maintain near-young levels of
performance early in training but not later, and adds to evidence that
IAL is supported by different learning networks in young and old
adults.

THE INFLUENCE OF DIRECTED ATTENTION ON SOURCE MEMORY
RETRIEVAL IN THE YOUNG AND OLD: AN ERP STUDY Michael
Dulas1,

Yashu Jiang1, Audrey Duarte1; 1Georgia Institute of Technology — Numerous
studies have shown that source memory accuracy declines with age and
neuroimaging evidence suggests that under-recruitment of frontallymediated executive processes, like post-retrieval monitoring, may
accompany this decline. Behavioral evidence suggests that directing
one’s attention toward item-source associations during encoding may
enhance source memory in the young and old. However, it is presently
unclear how directed attention during encoding modulates retrievalrelated neural activity in young and older adults. The present eventrelated potential (ERP) study investigated the effect of directing attention toward item-source associations during encoding on age-related
changes in source memory retrieval. Young and older adults studied colored objects, either under item-oriented encoding or under instructions
that directed attention towards the conjunction of an object and its presented color, and were later tested on their memory for the objects and
their previously presented color (source). Results demonstrated that
source accuracy was significantly improved via directed attention in
both groups. ERPs revealed that, compared to the item-oriented condition, directing attention to the object-color conjunctions reduced the
presence of frontal-maximal source retrieval ERPs in young adults. In
contrast, while older adults successfully recruited these frontal effects,
they showed greater post-retrieval monitoring ERPs for the directed
attention condition compared to the item-oriented condition. Results
suggest that, while directing attention toward item-source associations
successfully improves source memory accuracy in both young and old,
the underlying mechanisms behind this improvement may change with
age.

MEMORY TRAINING-INDUCED CHANGES IN NEURAL ACTIVITIES
ASSOCIATED WITH SOURCE MEMORY RETRIEVAL IN OLDER ADULTS

Juan Li1, Ting Zhou1, Bing Li1, Jing Yu1, Xin Li1; 1Center on Psychological Aging,
Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science — Training old adults

on mnemonic strategies can effectively increase their performance. But,
memory training that incorporates electrophysiological data as the outcome measure has not been investigated. We tried to approach this issue
by using an episodic retrieval paradigm (Li et al., 2004) in which a negative old-new effect observed only in elder (not in young) subjects. Therefore, a specific aim was to explore after training whether older brains
would resemble young ones by showing the negative pattern reduced.
16 healthy older individuals (aged 68.4 years old) completed 16 memory
training sessions (3 sessions per week, 1 hour per session), during which
several mnemonics (e.g. method of loci, face-name mnemonic) were
trained. ERPs were recorded when source memory retrieval was
assessed during both pre- and post- tests. The results did not show significant improvements on source performance after training, and the
age-specific negative old/new pattern did not change either. But the old
adults did performed better in terms of item accuracy,and corresponding comparison between pre- vs. post-ERPs were greater, lasted longer
and involved more left-lateralized activations. Healthy controls will be
tested soon to further identify the observed effects were resulted from
training or practice. These results suggested that healthy older adults
indeed benefit from memory training in a quantitative way as memory
performance improved with additional activation suggesting a compensation process, but not in a qualitative way as they stably used a different
neural circuitry from the young to optimize their performance even after
memory training.

DUAL PROCESS THEORY OF EPISODIC MEMORY: FINDINGS FROM THE

Fratiglioni1, Lars Bäckman1; 1Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute,
Stockholm, Sweden — Episodic memory exhibits age- and dementiarelated deficits, making it imperative to assess this form of memory in
large population samples. A cross-sectional study was conducted, utilizing recent behavioral and structural imaging data from a non-demented
population sample. We compared recall and recognition performance
across age groups with a focus on the dual process theory of episodic
memory. Postulating that recognition is supported by recollection and
familiarity processes, we aimed to assess this theory from a behavioral
and structural standpoint. Data from the SNAC-K population study
were used, with a main sample of 2665 participants and an MR subsample of 527 participants across 6 age groups (age = 60-100 years). Free
recall and recognition, including remember, know and guess responses
of recognition, were assessed with a 16-item word list. Delineation of the
hippocampus was performed manually. Multiple linear regressions of
behavioral data revealed expected age-related deficits in recall and recognition. Reliable correlations were observed between hippocampal volume and free recall (R2 = .03) and recognition (R2 = .03). Furthermore,
the recognition data indicated an age-related decline in remember
responses, but not for know responses. Partial correlations of structural
data, however, did not indicate a specific relationship between hippocampal volume and remember. Thus, behavioral, but not structural data
supported the dual process theory, indicating two distinct processes of
recognition, with recollection being more sensitive to aging effects.

but the underlying neural processes is to a large degree unknown. Thus,

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

the present study examines how associative learning observed through
event-related potentials (ERP) relates to DI as measured with an observation-only design. Thirty children participated in the study and acceptable ERP data was collected from 15 (9 boys). DI was measured with a
thirty minutes delay and ERP was recorded with a Geodesic High Density Net with 128 electrodes. The ERP procedure consisted of two pairs
of pictures presented six times (= the learning phase) and a test phase
introducing two violations: Two familiar pictures in a new combination
(ASSO) or a combination of one familiar and one novel picture (NOV). In
addition, visual recognition memory was also measured. ERP revealed
an Nc within 300-600 ms post stimuli. A higher mean amplitude was
observed for ASSO (p < .05) and a marginal effect was noted for NOV (p
= .055). Better DI performance correlated with larger Nc change scores
between ASSO and the last presentation in the learning phase (rs (15) =
.57; p < .05). Preliminary analyses of slow waves revealed no further relationship between ERP and DI and no significant correlation between DI
and novelty preference. These findings indicate that electrophysiological
indices of associative learning can be related to behavioral observations
of early memory processes in young infants. (FUNDING: FAS 2006XXXX)

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY OF RULE-BASED CATEGORY LEARNING AS A
FUNCTION OF AGE Krishna Bharani1, Dietta Chihade1, Kevin Nuechterlein1,

Sandra Weintraub2, Ken A Paller2, Paul J Reber2, Robert G Morrison1; 1Loyola
University Chicago, 2Northwestern University — A central challenge for trans-

lational cognitive neuroscience is to develop neurocognitive markers for
normal and pathological aging. To this end we tested healthy younger
(m=21 years) and older (m=71 years) adults using a rule-based categorylearning task where participants learn to categorize visual gratings using
trial-by-trial feedback while brain potentials were recorded. We have
previously characterized the event-related potentials (ERPs) sensitive to
strategy and categorization accuracy in this task. Previous functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies also with this task have demonstrated the importance of prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe,
two areas implicated in pathological aging including Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, older adults showed lower accuracy and longer RTs
than did younger adults, but there were two distinct subgroups. The
Rule subgroup learned slightly more slowly than younger adults, but
showed equivalent asymptotic accuracy. The No-Rule subgroup did not
learn and showed near chance performance throughout the task. ERPs
for the Rule subgroup showed a Late Positive Complex larger for correct
than incorrect trials, similar to that observed for younger adults. The
Rule subgroup also showed a feedback-locked P300 difference for correct/incorrect trials, but it was smaller than that in younger adults suggesting decreased rule-learning confidence (despite similar accuracy
across groups). The No-Rule subgroup showed ERPs characteristic of
chance performance. In conclusion, rule-based category learning may be
sensitive to factors predicting subsequent decline in executive and longterm memory abilities, as it appears to stratify older adults with neuropsychological profiles in the normal range.

ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE ABILITY TO SUSTAIN INTERFERENCE IN
EPISODIC MEMORY: NEURONAL CORRELATES AND INTERACTION WITH
BINDING MECHANISMS Yana Fandakova1, Yee Lee Shing1, Ulman

Lindenberger1; 1Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin,
Germany — We examined the contribution of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
to adult age differences in the ability to withstand interference from
highly familiar past events, and how these differences relate to binding
impairments in old age. 28 younger adults (YA) and 30 older adults (OA)
underwent fMRI assessment while performing a modified version of the
continuous recognition task. Participants saw the same set of unrelated
word pairs in three runs and identified pairs that were repeated within
runs. We hypothesized that OA will show higher false recognition of
familiar events compared to YA, reflecting deficits in PFC-mediated

169

Poster Session G — Monday, April 4, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
memory monitoring mechanisms. We expected OA’s false recognition to
be especially pronounced when associative information has to be
retrieved, due to additional age deficits in binding. The results revealed
that false recognition increased across runs for OA but not for YA, suggesting that monitoring mechanisms are not functioning optimally in old
age. Both age groups showed decrease in false recognition of rearranged
pairs across runs, but the decrease was more pronounced for YA, suggesting that deficits in memory control in interaction with binding deficits contribute to age differences in recall-to-reject processes. On the
neuronal level, YA but not OA showed increasing engagement of dorsolateral PFC across runs of the task, reflecting increasing control of memory interference due to previous encounters of the word pairs. In sum,
deficits in memory monitoring in old age reflect changes in the involvement of prefrontal regions in situations that place high demands on
memory control and binding mechanisms.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT, CORTICAL THICKNESS, AND
MEMORY Rebecca E. Martin1, Xiaoqian J. Chai1, Sunil Patel1, Kristen M.

Morin1, John D.E. Gabrieli1, Noa Ofen1; 1Massachusetts Institute of
Technology — Cortical thinning in development from childhood through
adulthood is a well-established phenomenon, however, little is known
about its relationship to memory abilities. We examined the relationship
between cortical thickness, age, and performance on a verbal source
memory task in 84 participants between the ages of 8 and 24. Structural
MRI images were processed and average measures of cortical thickness
were obtained using Freesurfer. Regions of interest included areas in the
medial temporal lobe (MTL) and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). Consistent with previous reports, we found strong negative correlations
between age and cortical thickness bilaterally in parahippocampal cortex
(PHC), a sub-region within the MTL, and in lPFC. Memory accuracy
(correct old and new responses) negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the left PHC (p=.003), and this relationship remained significant
when controlling for age (p=.004). In the lPFC, cortical thickness was not
related to memory accuracy. There was, however, a significant negative
correlation between cortical thickness in the left lPFC and the number of
source details participants remembered (ps<.04). There was also a negative correlation between the number of source details remembered, and
cortical thickness in the PHC (p=.008). When controlling for age, these
effects were not significant. Taken together, these data suggest that
memory ability is related to cortical thickness in MTL and lPFC. However, the relations between cortical thickness and memory ability in lPFC
are mediated by age, whereas those in the MTL may reflect individual
differences in memory ability not accounted for by development.

MEMORY SUPPORTS FACE PROCESSING ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
Jennifer Heisz1, Jennifer Ryan1; 1Rotman Research Institute — We

assessed
whether past experience minimizes age-related differences in face processing by monitoring the eye movements of older and younger adults
as they viewed faces that varied in the type/amount of prior exposure.
Prior exposure was manipulated by including famous and novel faces,
and by presenting faces up to five times. Compared to novel faces,
younger and older adults processed famous faces similarly with fewer
eye movements, with those fixations predominantly directed to the inner
features. Eye movements decreased across repeated exposures, though
more slowly for older than younger adults. Recruiting existing memories
may provide protection against age-related changes in face processing
that may be indicative of age-related deficits in the development of lasting face representations.

Institute of Living, 3University of Connecticut, 4Central Connecticut State
University — Alcohol consumption in college students is of interest due to
interactions between alcohol and the developing brain and this is an
important age for the development of prospective memory (PM). Fiftyseven first-year college students completed the Self-Rating Effects of
Alcohol (SREA), Modified Timeline Follow-back (TFLB), and Alcohol
Effects Questionnaire (AEQ) and two measures of PM. The time-based
measure required students to close the testing room door in exactly two
minutes. The event-based measure required students to sign their name
if they encountered a colored sheet of paper in the testing package. Both
measures were scored as 0 if no recognition of the task was given, 1 if the
task was partially completed or completed late, and 2 if the task was correct. The ongoing task was the MINI DSM-IV-TR alcohol use items.
Binge drinking was defined as consuming 5 or more drinks (male), or 4
or more drinks (female), in ~ 2 hours. Surprisingly, students performed
better on the time-based (mean = 1.60, s.d.=0.80) than on the event-based
measure (mean=0.77, s.d.= 0.98) of prospective memory. Students who
had binged in the last 30 days performed worse (mean=1.20, s.d.=0.41)
than social drinkers (mean=1.84, s.d.=0.57) and teetotalers (mean=1.82,
s.d.=0.21) on the time-based measure, whereas teetotalers (0.50,
s.d.=0.25) were the poorest performing group on the event-based measure. This suggests that binge drinking may have a specific detrimental
effect executive functions associated with PM. The findings of teetotalers
were not due to religious or cultural differencess and may reflect a
degree of rigid thinking.

Umeå, Sweden — A large body of research has demonstrated age-related
differences in white matter (WM) microstructure as well as age-related
functional (BOLD) differences on episodic memory tasks. However, little
is known whether age differences in WM integrity mediate task-induced
changes in BOLD signal within a memory network. To address this
issue, the present study combined measures from functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of a face-name paired-associates task and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). During the episodic encoding task, across
age groups (N = 111), increased activations were found in extensive
regions including bilateral fusiform gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
and bilateral hippocampus. An age-related functional increase was
observed in right prefrontal cortex, whereas a decrease was found in left
occipital cortex. Analysis of WM integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA)
revealed an extensive age-related linear decline that was more pronounced for anterior corpus callosum (CC). Moreover, mean FA measures in the anterior/posterior CC correlated with activation in occipital
cortex, such that lower WM integrity was associated with weaker BOLD
signal. Collectively, the results suggest that WM changes may at least in
part mediate age-related functional reductions.

play cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and "frontal-subcortical"
cognitive impairment. At autopsy, FXTAS brains typically have numerous mRNA-containing intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes.
Clinical neuropsychological tests have not found robust discriminators
between FXTAS and AD, possibly explained by the overlap of predilection sites (neocortex and hippocampus) for FXTAS inclusions and AD
pathology. ERPs were recorded during a semantic judgment task in
which congruous (50%) and incongruous target words were repeated
between ~10-140 seconds later, using a 32-channel EEG system. We compared the N400 and P600 components of 23 FXTAS patients (mean age=
72.7, MMSE= 26.3) to a matched-comparison group of 23 patients with
early AD/MCI (N= 2 mild AD, 21 MCI, of whom 12 later converted to
AD, mean age= 73.3, MMSE= 26.5) with split-plot ANOVAs. Analyses
revealed decreased N400 repetition effects of similar magnitude in both
groups, but significantly (p= 0.01) smaller P600 word repetition effects
(e.g. mean amplitude= -0.21 vs. 1.80 ?V at channel Pz) in the early AD/
MCI group compared to the FXTAS group. We believe this difference in
P600 word repetition amplitude reflects the relative sparing of episodic
memory and verbal memory-related neural circuits in FXTAS patients
compared to early stage AD.

AGING REDUCES THE SELECTIVITY OF DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL
CORTEX DURING RETRIEVAL MONITORING Ian M. McDonough1, Jessica
T. Wong1, David A. Gallo1; 1University of Chicago — We

investigated agerelated changes in the neural correlates of retrieval monitoring using
fMRI. Retrieval monitoring is the ability to evaluate the contents of memory to determine if an event occurred at all or in a specific context. At
study, younger and older adults were presented either with pictures of
common objects (rich perceptual context) or with the names of common
objects, and were asked to decide whether the object is made in a factory
(rich conceptual context). Two memory tests were completed in the scanner. One test focused on perceptual information (“seen as a picture?”),
and the other focused on conceptual information (“made a factory judgment?”). Across both age groups, memory accuracy was better when oriented towards perceptual than conceptual information. Moreover,
accuracy was equated between age groups when oriented towards perceptual information, but was impaired in older adults when oriented
towards conceptual information. Independent of test-orientation,
younger adults showed greater activity in dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex
when correctly rejecting studied than non-studied lures. This finding
suggests that younger adults selectively recruited DLPFC when monitoring familiar test items. In contrast, older adults showed the same level of
activity in this prefrontal region when correctly rejecting studied and
non-studied lures, independent of the type of information being
retrieved and when accuracy was equated with younger adults. This pattern indicates that aging altered the relationship between DLPFC and
retrieval monitoring, potentially because older adults non-selectively
engaged in effortful retrieval monitoring across all test items.

LEARNING AND MEMORY IN ADOLESCENCE: FEEDBACK-BASED

Alba1, Juan Deliz1, Itamar Kahn2, Daphna Shohamy1; 1Columbia University,
Technion – Israel Institute of Technology — Converging evidence demon-

strates that different kinds of learning depend on distinct neural systems. The hippocampus supports rapid encoding of single events – often
referred to as ‘episodic’ memory. The striatum, by contrast, is thought to
support feedback-based gradual learning of stimulus-response associations, or ‘incremental’ learning. Traditionally, these forms of learning
were thought to operate as distinct and independent systems. However,
emerging evidence suggests that the hippocampus and striatum interact
during learning, either competitively or cooperatively. Here, we
addressed two questions about the nature of the interactions between
these systems and their relevance for learning-guided behavior. First, in
adults, we sought to characterize intrinsic interactions between the hippocampus, the striatum and midbrain dopamine regions using resting-

state fMRI. Second, we probed the development of both memory systems during adolescence using a two-phase behavioral paradigm that
tests feedback-based learning, as well as memory-based generalization,
previously shown to depend on the striatum and hippocampus, respectively. Our results suggest that in adults successful generalization is
driven by interactions between the hippocampus and midbrain dopamine regions. In adolescents, we found variability in the ability to generalize, and this ability was independent of the ability to use feedback to
drive learning. These results are consistent with emerging evidence suggesting that the striatum and the hippocampus may develop at different
rates during adolescence, with important implications for developmental changes in learning-guided behavior.

CAN INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY PREDICT
MEMORY PERFORMANCE? Danielle King1, Michael Miller1; 1University of
California, Santa Barbara — The default mode network (DMN) is a set of
brain regions that commonly exhibit task-related decreases in BOLD
activity. These regions are functionally connected, demonstrating coherent, spontaneous, fluctuations in BOLD activity during rest. The functionality of this network remains uncertain; however, several groups
have suggested the network’s involvement in episodic memory processing. In the present study, we sought to examine how individual differences in the strength of the functional connection between DMN regions
could predict memory performance. Task and resting state time-course
data for both DMN regions as well as task-positive regions were
extracted and cross-correlated. These correlation values were then
entered into a multiple regression analysis predicting performance on a
source memory task. The results demonstrate that the strength of the
functional connections between both task-positive and DMN regions
during rest is strongly negatively associated with memory performance,
whereas the strength of functional connections during both encoding
and retrieval are far less predictive of performance. These results suggest
that intrinsic resting state brain activity is strongly related to memory
performance.

EPISODIC MEMORY FROM THE REMOTE PAST Peter Bright1, Michael D

Kopelman2; 1Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK, 2King's College
London, Institute of Psychiatry — The role of the hippocampus and other

medial temporal structures in the retrieval of remote episodic memories
remains fiercely contested in the literature. For the current investigation
we addressed an issue which has been identified as a primary reason for
conflicting theoretical positions: the sensitivity of employed behavioural
measures for distinguishing genuine episodic recollection from more
semantic memories. In our first study, we recoded existing data from a
recently developed autobiographical memory test administered to
patients with organic amnesia to ensure that all scores entered into our
analysis reflected genuinely episodic detail. We found that patients with
restricted medial temporal lesions were unimpaired (relative to controls)
in recalling episodes from the remote past but impaired in recalling episodes from the recent past (patients with widespread temporal lesions
were at or close to floor in recollecting recent and remote periods). In a
second study we selected a subset of patients (hippocampal; widespread
temporal). The same pattern was observed: hippocampal patients were
unimpaired in retrieving episodic details from the remote past but
severely impaired at retrieving from the recent past. The present findings, backed up by supportive quantified MRI evidence, indicate that
damage to the hippocampi or medial temporal lobes has a time-limited
effect upon the retrieval (or recollection) of remote episodic memories.

RELATING INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN REALITY MONITORING TO
MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX STRUCTURE Marie Buda1, Alex Fornito1,2,

Zara M. Bergström1, Jon S. Simons1; 1Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience
Institute, Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge,
UK, 2Melbourne Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Melbourne, Australia —
Reality monitoring refers to the memory retrieval process whereby one
introspectively judges whether a memory came from an internal or
external source (e.g., whether an event was imagined or actually
occurred). Neuroimaging research has implicated the medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC) in this cognitive process. In the healthy population, people often vary in their reality monitoring ability, and the question
explored here is whether this variability is associated with structural differences in the mPFC. A structure of potential interest to this question is
the paracingulate sulcus (PCS), which has a high level of morphological
variability within the normal population. In the current study, 53 healthy
volunteers were selected on the basis of MRI scans and classified into
four groups according to absence or presence of the PCS in their left or
right hemisphere. These participants performed a reality monitoring
task that tested their ability to discriminate whether stimuli had been
perceived or imagined, or whether they or another person had performed a task. Results showed that the group with absence of the PCS in
both hemispheres showed significantly reduced reality monitoring performance compared with the other participants. It might be predicted
that absence of the PCS could mean greater volume in the surrounding
frontal gyri. In accordance with this prediction, voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed significantly greater mPFC gray matter in individuals who performed poorly on the reality monitoring task. The current
findings provide evidence that individual differences in reality monitoring performance may be associated with structural variability in the
mPFC.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION UPDATING PREDICT
EPISODIC RETRIEVAL Erika Nyhus1,2, Tim Curran2; 1Brown University,
2University of Colorado at Boulder — The

right prefrontal cortex and left
parietal cortex have been implicated in the cognitive control of episodic
memory retrieval. In addition, the relationship between executive function tasks and episodic retrieval indicate that they both depend on similar cognitive control processes. We recently proposed that theta
oscillations represent interactions between brain systems for the control
of episodic retrieval (Nyhus & Curran, 2010). Top-down control of episodic retrieval is generally greater during source retrieval (e.g. retrieving
contextual information such as the study task that was associated with a
word) than during item retrieval (e.g. retrieving whether a word was
studied or not). The current experiment explored the relationship
between individual differences in executive function updating and theta
oscillations during item and source retrieval. Frontal theta power was
greater for old than new words from 500-800 ms. Theta coherence
between frontal and parietal regions was greater for old than new words
and was greater for incorrect than correct source judgments. In addition,
executive function updating positively correlated with item and source
accuracy, and there was a negative correlation between executive function updating tasks and theta coherence. These results indicate that monitoring the contents of working memory and monitoring the contents of
long-term episodic memory retrieval engage similar executive control
processes, and that subjects who have better executive control are more
efficient at monitoring the contents of episodic retrieval.

NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SUPPRESSION OF MEMORY
RETRIEVAL Ean Huddleston1,2, Michael C. Anderson2; 1Cambridge

University, 2MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit — Recent neuroimaging

work using the Think/No-Think (TNT) paradigm has shown that when
people suppress retrieval of unwanted memories, hippocampal activation is reduced. It remains unclear, however, whether retrieval suppres-

172

sion also modulates regions of neocortex supporting the representation
of the memory itself. To examine this issue, we developed a modified
TNT paradigm wherein people attempt to suppress the retrieval of faces
and scenes. Faces and scenes are ideal stimuli in that the cortical bases
for processing these types of stimuli are well documented, providing
specific brain regions in which to search for evidence of neocortical suppression—the fusiform face area (FFA) for faces, and parahippocampal
place area (PPA) for scenes. During the learning phase of our study, participants studied word-picture pairs. Then, during the Think/No-Think
phase, participants were shown the cue words for numerous word-picture pairs. For some words, participants were instructed to think of the
associated picture (“Think” condition), and for other words, participants
were instructed to not think of the associated picture (“No-Think” condition). Behavioral results showed that memory for suppressed items was
impaired, extending retrieval suppression effects to memories of faces
and scenes. Replicating prior work, imaging results showed hippocampal downregulation and DLPFC upregulation during No-Think trials
compared to Think trials. Furthermore, PPA (but not FFA) activation
was shown to be downregulated during No-Think trials compared to
Think trials, supporting the hypothesis (at least in the PPA) that retrieval
suppression modulates activation in the region of neocortex that supports the representation of the memory.

RECOLLECTION AND FAMILIARITY FOR WORDS AND SCENES: SHARED
AND INDEPENDENT NEURAL COMPONENTS Anthony Ryals1, Anne

Cleary1, Carol Seger1; 1Colorado State University — Previous research sug-

gests that recollection involves the hippocampus while familiarity
involves extrahippocampal regions such as perirhinal cortex (PRC) (e.g.,
Bowles et al., 2007; 2009, Montaldi & Mayes, 2010). The present study
used fMRI and the Recognition-without-Cued-Recall (RWCR) paradigm
to separate recollection from familiarity and directly compare RWCR of
words with RWCR of scenes (Cleary, 2004). Participants received three
study-test blocks of word stimuli and two study-test blocks of scene
stimuli. At test, participants received cues, some resembling studied
items and others not. In the word condition, study-test resemblance was
in the potential visual word form similarity of each cue to a studied
word. In the scene condition, resemblance was in the potential similarity
of the configuration of elements within the cue scene to that of a studied
scene. Memory for words recruited reading-related regions (angular/
supramarginal region and visual word form area), whereas memory for
scenes recruited scene-processing and navigation areas (posterior cingulate/ retrosplenial region and precuneus). In both the word and scene
conditions, an RWCR effect was shown: In the absence of cued recall,
participants gave higher ratings to test cues resembling studied items.
fMRI correlates of this RWCR effect replicated our prior research in
showing that PRC activity, but not hippocampal activity, correlated with
the RWCR effect. PRC activity was greater for cues resembling than not
resembling studied items. This pattern held for both the word and scene
conditions, suggesting that PRC involvement in RWCR may be amodal.

REWARD FACILITATES CONSTRUCTION AND LATER MEMORY OF
AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL EPISODES Katherine E. MacDuffie1, Elizabeth B.
Johnson1, Tara Iyengar1, Donna Rose Addis2, R. Alison Adcock1; 1Duke
University, 2The University of Auckland — Recent work suggests that dopam-

inergic modulation of the hippocampus promotes declarative memory
encoding (see Shohamy & Adcock, 2010). However, the effects of such
modulation on autobiographical event retrieval, another hippocampal
process, have never been investigated. We have previously shown that
engaging in a stimulating reward-anticipation task, which has been
shown to elicit activation of the VTA, results in a persistent enhancement
of encoding that lasts for a period of minutes (Johnson et al., 2010). The
current study investigates the carryover effects of the same reward anticipation task on autobiographical event construction. Participants
engaged in two blocks of a cued autobiographical event construction
paradigm (Addis et al., 2007), each preceded by a Reward-anticipation or

Control version of a cued reaction time (RT) task. Participants indicated
successful event construction with a button press, and then described the
event verbally. Twenty-four hours later, participants returned for a surprise retrieval test in which they were asked to recall the events constructed the day before. Participants were faster to retrieve past events
that had been constructed in the block that followed the Rewarded RT
task than in the block that followed the Control RT task. Furthermore,
past events constructed in the minutes following the Rewarded RT task
were rated as more significant and were preferentially remembered in a
retrieval test twenty-four hours later. This study provides preliminary
evidence that retrieving autobiographical episodes during a generalized
state of reward motivation may influence their content and later representation in memory.

SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NEURAL MECHANISMS
OF EPISODIC AND AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY RECALL Jared

Stokes1, Yoni Mazuz1, Sander Daselaar1, Morris Moscovitch2, Roberto
Cabeza1; 1Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Duke University, 2Rotman
Research Institute, Baycrest Centre, University of Toronto — In general, episodic memory (EM) refers to memory for micro-events experienced in
the laboratory (e.g., reading "dog" on a computer screen), and autobiographical memory (AM) to memory for events from one's own life (e.g.,
meeting first pet). It is currently debated whether EM and AM depend
on similar or different neural mechanisms. Although metaanalyses of
fMRI studies indicated very little overlap between EM and AM activation patterns, this finding could reflect differences in tasks rather than
differences in mechanisms. For example, EM studies typically measure
fast recognition of simple events whereas AM studies usually assess
slow recall of complex events. In the present fMRI study, we measured
slow recall of complex events for both EM and AM. In each EM trial, participants read a word (e.g., dog) and covertly recalled three studied pairs
forming a chain (e.g., dog-cat, cat-tiger, tiger-stripe). In each AM trial,
participants read a word and covertly recalled an associated autobiographical event. In both tasks, they pressed a key when recall was complete. Reaction times were around 4.5 sec in both tasks. EM and AM
tasks recruited a similar retrieval network, including prefrontal cortex
(PFC), posterior parietal, and posterior cingulate regions. At the same
time, some regions showed clear differences. For example, left dorsolateral PFC was differently engaged by EM, possibly reflecting greater
monitoring, whereas medial PFC was differentially recruited by AM,
possibly reflecting greater self-referential processing. In sum, EM and
AM involve similar neural mechanisms but differ in a few components
of the memory retrieval network.

REWARD-MOTIVATED
ENHANCEMENTS IN ITEM AND RELATIONAL MEMORY Jeff MacInnes1,

Kate MacDuffie1, Alison Adcock1; 1Duke University — Previous research has
demonstrated that the anticipation of future reward, associated with
conjoint activation of midbrain and hippocampus can enhance declarative memory for naturalistic scenes (Adcock et al. 2006). To determine
whether the entire mnemonic representation of events experienced during reward anticipation is enhanced, or only the features relevant to
obtaining future reward, the current study tested incentive effects on
component memory processes - item and relational memory – using a
color binding task (Staresina & Davachi, 2009). In this task, subjects were
required to bind a gray-scale object (item) to a colored border (relational). In a between-subjects design, experimental instructions were
manipulated to test the effects of explicitly incentivizing either item or
relational memory. In the item group (N=17), participants were
instructed that correct item-memory performance earned monetary
bonuses, while in the relational group (N=17) participants were
instructed that correct relational memory would earn monetary bonuses.
We observed a double dissociation across groups: Item memory performance for high-value items was significantly greater than low-value
items only in the item group, while relational memory performance for

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

high-value items was significantly greater than low-value items only in
the relational group. These results indicate that instructing participants
about salient features of upcoming experience can lead to feature-selective memory advantages, suggesting similarly selective enhancements of
MTL component processes by anticipated reward.

COMMON AND DISTINCT NETWORKS SUPPORTING EMOTIONAL
MODULATION OF SUCCESSFUL MEMORY ENCODING AND RETRIEVAL

Maureen Ritchey1, Laura Lorenzo-López1,2, Sander M. Daselaar1, Kevin S.
LaBar1, Roberto Cabeza1; 1Duke University, 2University of Santiago de
Compostela, Galicia, Spain — Emotion exerts its influence on both memory

encoding and retrieval processes. One way to study this influence is to
test emotion effects on encoding success activity (ESA) and retrieval success activity (RSA)-- activity distinguishing between remembered and
forgotten items at the encoding or retrieval phase. Previous studies taking this approach have highlighted the role of the amygdala and medial
temporal lobes during emotional ESA or RSA. However, to our knowledge, there has not yet been a direct comparison of emotion effects on
ESA and RSA in the same study. In this study, participants encoded
emotionally negative, positive, and neutral pictures. Two days later, they
returned for a surprise recognition memory test. FMRI data were collected during both the encoding and recognition phases. First, we investigated the overlap between ESA and RSA effects. Across both phases,
the hippocampus supported successful memory for both emotional and
neutral stimuli, whereas the amygdala supported successful memory for
emotional relative to neutral stimuli. Second, we tested for ESA-RSA differences that varied by emotion type. Consistent with previous findings,
a network of posterior midline and parietal regions negatively predicted
memory during encoding (reverse ESA) but positively predicted memory during recognition. Emotion modulated the encoding-retrieval flip
in these regions: negative valence accentuated the reverse ESA effect,
whereas both negative and positive emotion enhanced RSA. Thus,
whereas emotion affects memory processes in the amygdala and MTL
similarly across encoding and retrieval, its interactions with memory
success in posterior midline and parietal regions are more complex, suggesting distinct mechanisms.

COMMON AND DISTINCT PATTERNS FOR MEMORY SUCCESS AND
FAILURE DURING ENCODING AND RETRIEVAL Erik Wing1, Sander M.

Daselaar1, Scott M. Hayes2, Roberto Cabeza1; 1Department of Psychology &
Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC,, 2Memory Disorders Research
Center, Neuroimaging Research Center, Boston VA Healthcare System, Boston,
MA — The posterior midline and ventral parietal cortex (VPC) have been
identified as key components in a set of regions showing activity during
successful retrieval (Retrieval Success Activity/RSA) but unsuccessful
encoding (reverse Encoding Success Activity/ESA) (Daselaar et al.,
2009). While the processes underlying this encoding/retrieval flip are
not fully understood, one explanation is that during retrieval, RSA
reflects the beneficial effects of bottom-up attentional capture by taskrelevant memory items. Conversely, during encoding, reverse ESA elements reflect the effects of reflexive attentional capture by internal or
task-irrelevant thoughts, which disrupt rather than facilitate successful
encoding (Cabeza, 2008). Instead of reverse ESA/RSA overlaps, other
approaches have looked at regions where such activity differs by phase,
indicating phase-specific memory processes. In order to both delineate
the extent of reverse ESA/RSA overlaps and examine processes specific
to each phase, we examined encoding and retrieval activity across several fMRI memory studies encompassing a range of stimuli (pictures,
words, objects, etc.). In addition to finding flip activity in posterior midline and VPC, phase-specific comparisons revealed that reverse ESA profiles were relatively uniform across studies while RSA was more
variable. Reverse ESA contrasts also indicated stronger activation in
right parietal and dorsal midline regions whereas RSA activity was
stronger in left parietal and ventral midline areas. These findings dem-

onstrate the robust nature of encoding/retrieval overlaps but also suggest the operation of distinct phase-related processes. Exploring such
processes may reveal similarities in the disruption of attention-reliant
encoding processes and variability in retrieval activity influenced by
stimulus- or strategic-specific processing.

AN FMRI STUDY OF AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL EMOTIONAL MEMORY
RETRIEVAL IN CHILDREN Stephan Hamann1, Thanujeni Pathman1, Cory

Inman1, Carolina Campanella1, Priscilla Sansouci1, Robyn Fivush1, Patricia
Bauer1; 1Emory University — Autobiographical memory (AM), episodic
memory for significant life events, is a critically important form of memory that undergoes substantial developmental changes from childhood
to adulthood. However, relatively little is known regarding the functional neural correlates of AM retrieval in children as assessed with
FMRI, and how these may differ from adult patterns. We investigated
AM retrieval with FMRI in 14 children ages 7-12, contrasting retrieval
among three types of AMs (affectively positive, negative, and neutral)
and a semantic memory retrieval control. Subjects identified and extensively described target AMs prior to scanning and Galton-method twoword cues were created to cue later AM retrieval during scanning, with
postscan verification. AM retrieval was elicited by cue presentation (16 s;
button-press upon retrieval, followed by rest (12 s); semantic trials had
the same structure but involved verifying semantic properties. AM
retrieval activated key regions identified in adults during AM retrieval,
including medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and
hippocampal/parahippocampal regions, and these regions were more
active relative to the semantic control condition. Emotional AM elicited
activation in additional regions linked to emotional AM retrieval in
adults including the amygdala, insula, and prefrontal regions, and activation patterns differed substantially between positive and negative
AMs. These findings are the first to characterize regional brain activations during AM retrieval in children and to contrast positive and negative emotional AM retrieval, and highlight basic similarities in regions
activated during AM retrieval and previous adult studies. Ongoing
work will characterize adult performance on these AM tasks to identify
age-related differences.

EXPERIENCE-RELATED EYE MOVEMENTS REFLECT DECLARATIVE
MEMORY FOR EMOTIONAL AND NEUTRAL PICTURES Cory
Inman1,

Stephan Hamann1; 1Emory University — Considerable evidence suggests
that increased arousal as elicited by an emotional stimulus is related to
narrower attention and enhanced recollection of the stimulus. Using eye
tracking, a previous study found that attention was narrower for subsequently recollected items relative to familiar items, independent of emotional arousal. Our study examined whether attentional resources are
differentially distributed during encoding and retrieval as a function of
emotion arousal, valence, and subsequent memory. Eye tracking measures were recorded while participants encoded and later retrieved positive, negative, and neutral pictures in a free recall task and a remember/
know recognition task. In contrast to the earlier report, we found that
increased clustering at encoding predicted successful subsequent recognition for recollected items, but only for emotionally negative pictures
that were highly arousing. Salient features of highly arousing negative
pictures may more strongly capture attention during encoding, which
allows for rich cognitive elaboration and successful encoding of the stimulus. We also found that during recognition, eye fixations were more
clustered for ‘remembered’ relative to ‘known’ pictures, especially negative remembered pictures. This finding suggests that during recognition,
recollection may be prompted by enhanced memory for the salient features of previously seen negative photos. Freely recalled items were
associated with more clustered attention relative to items that were not
freely recalled, independent of emotional valence or arousal. Our findings differ from the previous study’s findings. Our findings suggest that
visual attention during encoding and retrieval reliably reflect emotion,

subsequent recall, and the subjective experience that accompanies recognition of a stimulus.

G29
EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF POST-LEARNING SLEEP ON
CONSOLIDATION OF ASSOCIATIVE EMOTIONAL DECLARATIVE
MEMORIES Carolina Campanella1, Stephan Hamann1; 1Emory University —
Binding different attributes of an event together and maintaining these
associations is an essential function of episodic memory. Previous studies suggest sleep plays a key role in strengthening these associations, and
this facilitation may be greater for emotionally salient stimuli than for
emotionally neutral stimuli. However, it remains unclear whether postlearning sleep preferentially boosts emotional associations relative to
neutral associations, in a similar way that it boosts memory for emotional single items. Using a cued-recall task, we examined whether sleep
preferentially enhanced memory for emotionally negative vs. neutral
verbal associates. Semantically unrelated word pairs were constructed
by pairing a neutral cue word and a target word (either negatively
arousing or neutral). Participants studied a list of 90 word pairs (45 neutral, 45 negative) and were instructed to attempt to form associations
between the two words of each pair. The study phase was repeated once
to increase levels of learning. Following a 12-hour break filled with
either a period of sleep or wakefulness, participants were given a surprise cued-recall test for all previously presented pairs. As with previous
studies, sleep enhanced cued recall for all pairs. However, the effect of
sleep was equivalent for negative and neutral pairs, rather than disproportionately enhancing memory for negative pairs. Our results suggest
the enhancing effect of sleep on paired-associate cued recall is independent of the emotional arousal of target items. These results contrast with
previous findings and indicate the effects of sleep on memory for emotional material can differ substantially across different memory tasks.

FALSE RECOGNITION, RETRIEVAL FAILURE, AND ATTENTIONAL
PROCESSES DURING EPISODIC MEMORY RETRIEVAL Scott A. Guerin1,

Clifford A. Robbins1, Adrian W. Gilmore2, Daniel L. Schacter1; 1Harvard
University, 2Washington University, St. Louis, MO — People often falsely recognize objects that are similar to items they have encountered recently, a
form a gist-based memory distortion. However, people can retain
detailed information about recently encountered objects. Thus, it is possible that people retain specific details but do not utilize them when
memory illusions occur. We created a paradigm that encouraged subjects to attend to the perceptual features that distinguish targets from
related distracters. On each trial of the recognition test, an array of three
objects was presented; two of them were related to each other. FMRI
scanning was conducted during recognition testing. Subjects selected
one of the items as “old” or rejected all items as “new”. When a related
distracter was presented with two unrelated items, false recognition
rates were high (41%). However, when the related distracter was presented alongside its associated target, false recognition rates fell to baseline levels (12%), suggesting that the details are accessible under
appropriate conditions. Performance during this latter condition was
associated with increased activity in the dorsal attention network and
ventral visual cortex. Eye tracking data revealed that participants in this
condition systematically compared the two related items, but also
showed that the patterns of brain activation could not be attributed to
differential eye movement patterns across conditions. Collectively, these
findings suggest that suppression of false recognition involves an iterative interaction between attention and episodic memory: retrieval guides
the deployment of visuospatial attention to mnemonically relevant
details, which in turn improves the retrieval of diagnostic information
from memory.

TWO WAYS OF ACCESSING THE PERSONAL PAST: AN FMRI STUDY
EXAMINING THE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS
L.
St.
DURING AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY RETRIEVAL Peggy

Jacques1, Martin Conway2, Matthew W. Lowder1, Roberto Cabeza1; 1Duke
University, 2University of Leeds — Autobiographical memories (AMs) are

typically elicited using either verbal (i.e., event descriptions) or visual
stimuli (i.e., photographs), but the effects of these cues on the neural
mechanisms supporting memory retrieval are not well understood. The
present study compared the functional connections among the regions
supporting the rich experience of the personal past elicited via verbal
descriptions or visual images. We used a novel camera technology,
which employs a sensor and timer to automatically take hundreds of
photographs when worn, in order to generate personal photographs to
elicit AMs and compared this to memories retrieved via event descriptions taken from logs of daily events that participants recorded. Following AM retrieval, online ratings of subjective recollection, or reliving,
were acquired on each trial during functional MRI scanning to identify a
common functional region of interest in the hippocampus that was used
in subsequent functional connectivity analysis. Given the central importance of visual imagery in AM, we predicted that visual images would
foster integration among the brain regions supporting memory retrieval.
Consistent with this prediction, the results indicated that AMs elicited
using visual versus verbal cues involved greater co-activation among the
hippocampus and three critical regions of the retrieval network: 1) lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions involved in retrieval control, 2)
medial PFC associated with self-referential processing, and 3) ventral
parietal cortex linked to bottom-up attention processes. In sum, these
results suggest that visual images augment the recollection of autobiographical experiences by strengthening the functional connections
among the retrieval network.

IDENTIFYING THE COMPONENT PROCESSES OF MENTAL SIMULATION:
EVIDENCE FROM REPETITION-RELATED DECREASES IN THE BOLD
RESPONSE Karl Szpunar1, Gagan Wig2, Peggy St. Jacques1, Cliff Robbins1,
Daniel Schacter1; 1Harvard University, 2Washington University in St. Louis — In

recent years, cognitive neuroscientists have demonstrated that a core
network of brain regions involved in remembering past events is also
involved in simulating possible future events. However, it remains
unclear what processes are subserved by specific regions within this network. The purpose of the present study was to investigate what regions
are involved in processing familiar locations and objects during mental
simulation, as indexed by repetition-related decreases in BOLD activity.
Using event-related fMRI, subjects were presented with a series of location-object-action (l-o-a) pairings that required them to simulate being in
familiar locations, performing given actions with given objects. Subjects
first completed “study” sessions during which they simulated a subset
of l-o-a pairings two times (in random order). Subjects then completed
“test” sessions during which they simulated additional l-o-a pairings
that were either systematically related or unrelated to the l-o-a pairings
from the study sessions. To ascertain what regions exhibit sensitivity to
processing familiar locations and objects during simulation, the BOLD
responses associated with new l-o-a pairings were respectively contrasted against: (1) l-o-a pairings in which the location was once again
repeated from the study sessions (but paired with a new action-object
pair) and (2) l-o-a pairings in which the object-action pair was once again
repeated from the study sessions (but paired with a new location). Preliminary results suggest that, in the context of mental simulation, distinct
regions are responsible for processing familiar locations (left anterior
prefrontal and left posterior parietal cortex) and objects (anterior and lateral temporal cortex).

WHITE MATTER CORRELATES OF EPISODIC

Attali1,

Thiebaut de Schotten1, Gianfranco Dalla Barba1,2; 1Institut du Cerveau et de la
Moelle Epinière. INSERM U975 Paris, 2Università degli studi di Trieste —

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) not only have great difficulty
retrieving memories but also suffer from memory distorsions like confabulation. Impaired episodic memory in AD results from the dysfunction of an integrated limbic-diencephalic network and involves both
gray and white matter (WM) pathologies. The neural substrates of confabulation still remain unknown. Our study aims to determine the contribution of WM changes to episodic memory impairments in patients
with AD and more particularly neural correlates of the production of
confabulation. Twelve AD patients and 12 normal controls (NC) participated in the study. All participants received a clinical examination, a
large neuropsychological testing battery including the Confabulation
battery, and an imaging protocol including structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Fractional
anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were mesured at different
locations of white matter using ROI-based analysis and were correlated
with neuropsychological tests score. Results show a significant group
effect on neuropsychological tests score and on DTI measures. Compared with NC, AD patients had increased MD and reduced FA in widespread brain regions, most notably in frontal and temporal lobes,
cingulum, corpus callosum, fornix and uncinate fasciculus. Moreover,
we found a significant correlation between episodic memory scores and
MD of the cingulum and fornix. Confabulations were associated with
DTI measures of the uncinate fasciculus. Our results are consistent with
previous studies underlying the role of hippocampal circuitry in episodic memory but also reveal a probable correlation between the production of confabulation and the WM tracts downstream the
hippocampus.

CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SIMULATED DISSOCIATION DURING
ENCODING OF AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL-LIKE MEMORY AND DISTURBED
EPISODIC RETRIEVAL Loretxu Bergouignan1, Lars Nyberg2, Henrik
Ehrsson1; 1Karolinska Institutet, 2Umeå University — Until now only animal

studies have properly controlled the encoding processes of episodic-like
memories. But episodic memory is based on the subjective level of the
retrieval, which can only be assessed in humans. Here we demonstrate
that the human brain can use two fundamentally different encoding processes for autobiographical-like memory. We used a perceptual illusion
to simulate the experience of being out-side one’s body (‘out-of-bodyillusion’; Ehrsson Science 2007, 317:1048) which is common in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with dissociation symptom (encoding in
third person perspective, E3PP). We compared encoding from this illusory E3PP perspective in healthy participants with encoding from the
first person perspective (E1PP). During these states the participants took
part in life-like realistic role-playing scenarios with a professional actor.
In experiment 1 the retrieval session was a Remember/Know paradigm
assessed one week later. The E3PP induced significantly less episodic
retrieval than the E1PP. In experiment 2 we compared brain activity during retrieval of these memories encoded in E3PP or E1PP (fMRI). There
was a significant difference during retrieval on in one unique region: the
left posterior hippocampus. This study demonstrates, for the first time,
that the first person perspective is essential for normal memory encoding. Further, the human brain can use two different encoding processes
for autobiographical-like memories depending on the perspective, but
these rely on different hippocampus-mechanisms during retrieval. The
observed causal relationship between the simulated dissociation and disturbed episodic retrieval is a crucial step to understand the labile trauma
memory of PTSD.

ITEM/SOURCE MEMORY PERFORMANCE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS
IN 3D VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS: AN EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL
STUDY JiWoon Jeong1, Seung-Hwan Lee2, Hyun-Jung Han1, Hyun Taek Kim1;
1Korea University, 2Inje University College of Medicine — Recent

studies have
demonstrated that schizophrenia with hallucination can be associated
with source memory deficits. The present study investigated the item/
source memory performance of schizophrenia patients in 3D virtual
environments, which is a useful means to assess memory of the spatial
context of an event. Twenty schizophrenia patients (10 with auditory
hallucination and 10 without hallucination, respectively) and fourteen
healthy controls were subjected to an encoding session in which they
navigated four different places equipped with sixty 3D objects. After the
encoding session, the event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during item/source recognition memory tests for previously studied
objects. For correctly recognized item/sources, posterior old/new effects
were observed (~300-600ms) in all three separate groups. Frontal positivity (~200-500ms) was evident in normal control group but not in the
other two schizophrenia groups. Importantly, occipital positivity (~9001100ms) was observed in the both the normal control group and the
schizophrenia without hallucination group. These results suggest two
possibilities. First, that the latter two ERP components reflect source
memory deficits in schizophrenia patients. Second, the occipital positivity is correlated with source memory deficits caused by hallucination.

DESTABILIZED PREDICTION AFTER RARE BREACHES OF EXPECTANCY

Anne B. Kühn1, Ricarda I. Schubotz1,2; 1Max Planck Institute for Neurological
Research, Cologne, Germany, 2Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, Münster,
Germany — We are used to well-experienced and rarely altered perceptual events like songs or movies. While forward models provide a theoretical framework for prediction of such events and how we detect
breaches of expectation, imaging studies have attributed the prediction
of sequences to premotor cortices and the detection of breaches and its
immediate effects to the anterior cingulate and the lateral prefrontal cortex. For the first time, the present fMRI study explored remote effects
after rare breaches of expectancy. Destabilization of prediction was
hypothesized to be reflected either by an attenuation of long-term memory related areas like the hippocampus, or by an increase of lateral
fronto-parietal areas related to the encoding of current stimuli. Subjects
monitored a repeatedly presented digit sequence and were asked to indicate occasional sequential omissions. Destabilization of prediction was
expected to be revealed by contrasting stimuli whose equivalent was
omitted in the preceding sequential run (destabilized events) with stimuli without such history (non-destabilized events). Remote destabilization of prediction was reflected by attenuation of activity in the medial
Brodmann Area 9 bilaterally. Moreover, activation of the same area, the
retrosplenial area, and the left parahippocampal gyrus were enhanced
by contrasting predicted events with breaches of expectancy. The
decrease of dorsal frontomedian activation in destabilized events may be
interpreted as a top-down modulation on perception causing a less
expectation-restricted encoding of the current stimulus, enabling the
adaptation of prediction in the long run.

TWO MECHANISMS OF VOLUNTARY MEMORY SUPPRESSION Roland G
Benoit1, Justin C Hulbert1, Michael C Anderson1; 1Medical Research Council
UK — When confronted with an unwelcome reminder of a past event,

people often attempt to prevent the event from coming to mind. Previous research has shown that repeatedly preventing retrieval of an
unwanted memory leads to forgetting of the avoided memory item
(Anderson & Green, Nature, 2001). Neuroimaging evidence implicates
extensive, bilateral aspects of lateral prefrontal cortex in mediating such
memory suppression (Anderson et al., Science, 2004; Depue et al., Science, 2007). However, these studies did not examine the exact mechanism supported by different prefrontal subregions. The present

176

functional magnetic resonance imaging study employed a between-subject design to elucidate the neural correlates of two potential mechanisms: ‘thought substitution’ (i.e., retrieving an alternative thought to
distract from the unwanted memory) and ‘direct suppression’ of the
unwanted item. Though both mechanisms led to forgetting of the suppressed items compared to a baseline condition, they were supported by
partly separable prefrontal subregions. The results thus suggest that voluntary memory suppression can be mediated by two distinct neuro-cognitive mechanisms.

SOURCE MEMORY CAN BE IMPAIRED BY ANODAL TRANSCRANIAL
DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION OVER THE LEFT PARIETAL CORTEX

Tzeng1,2; 1Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, National Central University,
Taiwan, 2Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica, Taiwan — Recent neuroim-

aging studies of episodic-memory retrieval frequently reported activations in the left posterior parietal (LPP) cortex. Various interpretations
have been raised to construe the contributions of this region to memory
retrieval, yet very few studies investigate whether the involvement of
the LPP is necessary for memory retrieval, and how memory would be
affected if neural activities in the LPP is facilitated or interfered. In this
study we used transcranical direct current stimulation (tDCS) to probe
the LPP’s functional role in memory retrieval. Four blocks of source
memory tests were conducted on separate days. At study, participants
were presented with concrete nouns shown in green or blue color. At
test, participants made old/new and source judgments to studied and
unstudied items. Between the study and test phases of the four blocks,
participants received either sham, anodal, cathodal, or no tDCS over the
left parietal cortex (P3 site of the 10-20 system) for 10 minutes. The
results showed that the old/new recognition performance was statistically equivalent for the four conditions. The analysis of source memory
performance, however, yielded an intriguing pattern when the gender of
the participants was taken into account. For male participants, no tDCS
effects were found on the source memory performance. For female participants, a worse source memory performance was observed when
anodal tDCS was applied. It is not clear why there was a gender difference on the tDCS effect yet the current finding did provide evidence that
source memory could be modulated by stimulating the left parietal cortex.

healthy adolescents. Retrieval ERP effects of interest were the left parietal old/new effect (recollection) and mid-frontal old new effect (familiarity), while we were also interested to investigate subsequent memory

design, participants performed a recognition memory task, during
which time EEG was recorded, subsequent to ingestion of either a) glucose, or b) placebo in a counterbalanced order. Response times during
the recognition memory task were observed to be faster for the glucose
condition, relative to placebo. Further, glucose ingestion was associated
with enhanced ERP effects of both ‘recollection’ and ‘familiarity’, relative
to placebo. These findings suggest that glucose enhances both the recollection and familiarity components of recognition memory. The

previously experienced episodes and facts depends on neural plasticity
at learning and on further memory stabilization during the time between
initial learning and retrieval. One likely mechanism for memory stabilization involves the strengthening of connections among cortical subcomponents initially linked via the hippocampus. This process of
consolidation may be advanced through intentional memory rehearsal
as well as through slow-wave activity during sleep. Slow-wave sleep is
reduced in aging, possibly contributing to age-related memory decline.
We investigated whether a memory improvement can be achieved in
older adults through transcranial slow-oscillatory stimulation during
sleep. We adopted procedures for passing a low-frequency current
through scalp electrodes during sleep, which modestly improved memory in young adults (Marshall et al., 2004, 2006). On two afternoons separated by one week, healthy 65- to 80-year-olds took a 90-min nap while
electroencephalographic activity was monitored. Word-paired-associate
recall was assessed just prior to and shortly after each nap, one of which
also included a 30-min stimulation period during non-REM sleep. Comparing post-nap to pre-nap recall yielded a memory improvement measure. We observed a greater memory improvement with stimulation
compared to without stimulation in 70% of participants (mean 10%
larger improvement for N=10). Slow-wave activity and other physiological sleep measures provided additional data on possible mechanisms of
sleep-related memory improvement. These results provide novel
insights regarding the role of sleep in memory consolidation and memory decline, and may be of further value for designing treatments aimed
at improving memory function in individuals with memory deficits.

HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI MEASUREMENTS OF HIPPOCAMPAL AND
MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE SUBREGION INTERACTIONS DURING
EPISODIC MEMORY FORMATION AND RETRIEVAL. Katherine Duncan1,

Lila Davachi1,2; 1Department of Psychology, New York University, 2Center for
Neuroscience, New York University — Although it is well established that the
medial temporal lobe (MTL) is involved in both the formation and
retrieval of episodic memories, how MTL subregions support these different processes is still poorly understood. To date, the majority of
research in this area has focused on identifying which MTL subregions
display memory-related responses during either encoding or retrieval
tasks. Although some studies have found that individual regions are differentially involved in encoding or retrieval (Eldridge et al., 2005; Preston et al., 2010), these dissociations have not been consistent across
studies. As an alternative approach, we measured how responses across
MTL subregions correlate differentially during periods of encoding and
retrieval using high-resolution fMRI (1.5 x 1.5 x 3mm voxels). During
functional scans, participants performed a series of tasks, each with similar trial-timing and response options. First, subjects performed an arithmetic task that served as a baseline measure of inter-region correlation
during a task with no explicit episodic memory demands. Next, participants performed 4 cycles of an associative encoding task, an intervening
arithmetic task, and an associative recall task. Time-courses were
extracted from the individual subregions of the hippocampus and MTL
cortex and measures of inter-regional correlations were calculated separately for each of the tasks. Recall accuracy was high, indicating that participants were successfully encoding and retrieving memories.
Preliminary analysis of the imaging data provides evidence for reliable
MTL inter-regional correlations. Moreover, the results suggest that these

Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, School of Psychology, Cardiff
University, UK, 2Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University,
UK — One account of the role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in recognition memory is that the perirhinal cortex (PrC) processes item information, the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) context information, and the
hippocampus (HC) binds items with their contexts (Diana et al, 2007).
Another view highlights the distinct contribution of these regions to
memory for different types of visual stimuli, independently of item and
context (Graham et al., 2010). To investigate the neural correlates of item
and context memory encoding for pictures of everyday objects, participants studied objects in one of two encoding tasks in the MRI scanner.
Outside of the scanner they then made item (old vs. new) and context
(encoding task) memory judgements to previously seen and novel
objects. An orthogonal functional localiser task was used to identify voxels sensitive to processing objects (intact objects > scrambled objects)
within PrC, PHC, and HC. Activity in the voxels identified by the functional localiser was separated according to performance on the memory
test to investigate which MTL regions predicted accurate item and context memory judgements for objects. No memory effects for objects were
detected in the HC object-sensitive voxels. Activity within the left PrC,
however, predicted context memory for the objects, with greater activity
for trials that were later identified in the correct study context versus
those that were not. These data argue against accounts that ascribe the
sole function of the perirhinal cortex to processing item-based mnemonic
information.

DISTINCT MECHANISMS FOR ASSOCIATIVE AND ITEM MEMORY OVER
have
TIME Xiaoya Du1, Jiongjiong Yang1; 1Peking University — Studies
shown that compared to item memory, associative memory elicits stronger activation in the hippocampus when tested at a short interval after
study. However, little is known whether remote item and associative
memory differ in their neural mechanisms over time. To address the
issue, a behavioral experiment was first conducted to observe the forgetting rates of the two kinds of memory after 10 min, 1 day, 1 week and 1
month. Item memory began to decrease rapidly after 1 day, whereas
associative memory was well reserved till 1 week later. The difference
could be attributed to the predominant contribution of recollection process to associative memory. The following functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design was used to further examine the brain
activation for associative and item memory. Learning conditions were
adjusted to yield comparable memory performance in different time
points and between item/associative memory. Activity in the hippocampus gradually decreased from 40 min to 1 month for item test; but it kept
relatively constant across time for association test. In particular,
although the activity of the hippocampus was comparable between item
and association tests after 40 min, its activation was significantly stronger for associative memory than for item memory after 1 day ,1 week
and 1 month. In addition, the parahippocampal gyrus also elicited stronger activity for associative memory than item memory after 1 month.
These fMRI data was consistent with the behavioral results, and suggested that associative memory relies on distinct cognitive and neural
mechanism from item memory.

depending on the assessment of their future performance. The current
study investigated neural correlates of monitoring accuracy and how
they are related to structures historically associated with encoding success (e.g., hippocampus). To evaluate monitoring, subjects provided
Judgments of Learning (JOLs), in which they predicted their future
memory performance during encoding. Twelve young adults provided a
JOL response (“will remember” or “will forget”) for 150 intact (easy) and
150 scrambled (difficult) visual scenes while in a 3.0 T scanner. We
hypothesized that areas associated with monitoring accuracy would
recruit regions separate from traditional areas associated with encoding
success. Predictive judgments and actual memory performance were
compared and subsequent neural activation was independently
explored for memory accuracy and monitoring accuracy. Areas in the
hippocampus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and left medial temporal lobe (MTL) were associated with encoding success. Monitoring accuracy recruited some overlapping areas; however, it was also associated
with regions that are related to self awareness (bilateral cuneus, bilateral
precuneus and right superior frontal gyrus). These findings provided a
more complete account of monitoring accuracy, and should be explored
further to disambiguate monitoring as a unique contributor to performance.

Bardouille3, Jennifer Ryan1,2; 1Rotman Research Institute, 2University of
Toronto, 3NRC Institute for Biodiagnostics — Differences underlying the
construction of, and subsequent access to, representations regarding the
relative spatial relations among sequentially presented objects were
examined using magnetoencephalography (MEG) for younger (M=25.3
years) and older adults (M=62.5 years). Participants were presented with
a series of single objects. Subsequently, a test display revealed the objects
simultaneously and participants judged whether the relative relations
were maintained. Accuracy was approximately 85.3% for intact displays
and 76.1% for manipulated displays, and did not differ significantly
between younger and older adults. MEG results revealed activity in posterior visual regions within the first 200 ms after stimulus onset. Activity
within the precuneus and middle frontal gyrus was found within 170300 ms after stimulus onset. Examination of contrast maps between
younger and older participants revealed that compared to younger
adults, older adults showed stronger neural activity in the hippocampus,
the superior temporal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In contrast, younger adults showed stronger neural activity in posterior cortices such as the lingual gyrus and cuneus. This suggests that younger and
older adults may adopt different strategies in which to bind spatial relations across time in order to achieve comparable performance. Specifically, while younger adults may maintain the visual information active
in the posterior sensory cortices, older adults may rely more on a hippocampal-frontal system, possibly as a compensatory response.

AGE-RELATED EYE MOVEMENT DIFFERENCES IN RELATIONAL BINDING
ACROSS TIME. Douglas McQuiggan1, Rachel Bloom1, Christina Villate1,

Lily Riggs1,2, Jennifer Ryan1,2; 1Rotman Research Institute, 2University of
Toronto — Age-related differences in the construction of, and subsequent
access to, relative spatial relations among objects were investigated
using eye movement monitoring (EMM) for older (M=73.13 years) and
younger adults (M=24.94 years). During the study phase, participants
were presented with a series of single objects. Subsequently, a test screen
displayed all of the objects simultaneously and participants judged
whether the relative relations were maintained. Accuracy was lower for
older (intact M = 81%, manipulated M= 75%) versus younger adults
(intact M= 90%, manipulated M = 87%). EMM revealed age-related differences in viewing during the study and test phase. When the third and
final object was presented during the study phase, younger participants
not only directed viewing to the object itself, but also to the empty locations which had been previously occupied by objects 1 and 2; this pattern

178

was reduced in older adults. During viewing of the test displays,
younger adults directed increased viewing to the manipulated region
compared to the same region of intact displays. This pattern of viewing
was absent among older adults. These findings suggest that eye movements are used to construct and integrate information across time (Ryan
& Villate, 2009). The observed age-related differences in accuracy and
eye movement behaviour may reflect age-related declines in one’s ability
to bind information across time, possibly as a consequence of declines in
hippocampal function (Ryan et al., CNS abstract submission 2011). Alternatively, such age-related differences may reflect the use of different
strategies to support performance on the task.

Christina Villate1, Lily Riggs1, R. Shayna Rosenbaum1,2; 1Rotman Research
Institute, 2York University — The effect of the hippocampus on the construction of, and subsequent access to, relative spatial and temporal relations
among objects was investigated using eye movement monitoring (EMM)
in one session with a developmental amnesic patient HC (22 years), and
in three sessions with patient DA who developed amnesia as a result of
herpes encephalitis (56 years at time of testing), and their age-matched
controls. During the study phase, participants were presented with a
series of single objects, each in a unique location. Subsequently, a test
screen displayed the objects simultaneously and the participants judged
whether the relative relations were maintained. Accuracy for HC was
near 100% for intact and manipulated trials and was not different from
controls; accuracy for DA was 100% for intact trials in each session, and
varied from 50-100% for manipulated trials across sessions. During the
study phase, control participants directed eye movements towards not
only the presented object, but also to the empty locations that had been
previously occupied by other study objects. This viewing pattern was
greatly reduced in HC and DA. This dissociation between eye movements and explicit memory suggests that the hippocampus is critical for
the integration of information across time as indexed by eye movements,
however, the hippocampus is not critical for successful performance on
this task.

SIMILARITY OF PATTERNS OF NEURAL ACTIVITY DURING PERCEPTION
AND VIVID REMEMBERING OF SHORT MOVIE CLIPS Bradley

Buchsbaum1,2, Candice Fang1,2, Sabrina Lemire-Rodger1, Jeremy Young1;

Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest, 2University of Toronto — The subjective essence of a rich and vivid memory is that it is a kind of imperfect
revisitation of a past experience. This seeming similarity between a
memory and the perceptual experience which it represents may occur
because the very same neural structures that were active during perception are reactivated during memory . Insofar as memory captures something of the complex and multimodal aspect of perception, the cortical
representations of memory should resemble the widely distributed patterns of activity elicited during perception. To test this hypothesis we
used fMRI to scan subject (N=17) while they passively viewed a set of 12
9-s video clips, which were chosen to be maximally diverse in their subject matter. A subset of these subjects (N=8) then took part in a 6-8 week
training regimen consisting of at least 18 1-hour sessions in which they
practiced mentally recalling each of the 12 video clips. After training,
subjects were scanned in three post-training sessions where they performed a task requiring them to vividly remember each of the video
clips. Results showed that patterns of activation evoked during vivid
remembering were highly similar to the corresponding patterns at perception. In addition, the multivariate similarity structure, as assessed
with multidimensional scaling, among the activity patterns associated
with each video were structurally similar across perception and memory. The findings show that perception and memory share an overlapping cortical representation, and that this representation is distributed
and specific to the particular content matter of the remembered experiences.

REPETITION-INDUCED CHANGES IN FACE VIEWING ARE NOT AFFECTED
BY MANIPULATION OF FACE VIEWPOINT ACROSS REPETITIONS
Rosanna Olsen1,2, Yunjo Lee1,2, Cheryl Grady1,2, Morris Moscovitch1,2, Jennifer
Ryan1,2; 1Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest, 2University of Toronto —

When viewing recently repeated items (such as a face), eye fixations
decrease as a function of repetition. These repetition-induced decreases
are thought to index learning, as previous experiences with a given face
provide a mnemonic trace that facilitates subsequent processing. We
investigated whether small changes in viewpoint between repetitions (525 degree rotational shifts) affected the typical viewing decrease. We
conducted two experiments to address this question. In Experiment 1,
participants viewed 80 famous and 80 non-famous faces (for 4s) three
times across three study blocks. In Experiment 2, 80 non-famous faces
were viewed (for 4s) five times across five study blocks. In both studies,
eye-movements were recorded with a head-mounted eye-tracker while
participants made a gender judgment for each face. Half of the faces
were displayed from the same viewpoint across repetitions (static viewpoint condition) and half of the faces were shown from different viewpoints across repetitions (alternating viewpoint condition). In both
studies, participants showed the typical face repetition effect: fewer eye
fixations were observed with each repetition. Interestingly, this effect
was equivalent for faces that were presented in the static viewpoint condition and for those which were presented in the alternating viewpoint
condition. These findings suggest that repetition-induced viewing patterns reflect at least a partially viewpoint independent representation in
memory.

A BRAIN SIGNATURE FOR FALSE RETRIEVAL? AN ERP STUDY Giulio

Pergola1,2, Michele Trotta3, Irene Daum1,2, Boris Suchan1,2; 1Ruhr-University
Bochum, 2International Graduate School of Neuroscience, Bochum, 3Faculty of
Psychology, Padua — Several data point to a role of right prefrontal cortex
in retrieval monitoring (Schacter and Slotnick, 2004). It has been proposed that late frontal ERP components can distinguish false from true
memories (Wiese and Daum, 2006; Curran et al., 2001; Goldmann et al.,
2003). We employed pictorial stimuli in an associative memory task during an ERP recording session. Subjects learned associations between two
pictures. Later on, single studied and unstudied items were shown and
subjects performed an old/new assessment. After “old” responses subjects retrieved the associated picture using the picture shown as a cue.
Cues were either ambiguous or unambiguous. Ambiguous cues were
semantically linked to an item presented in another pair of the study list.
Unambiguous cues had no semantically related pictures in the study list.
The percentage of correct cued retrieval did not differ across conditions.
ERPs of hits followed by correct ambiguous (Ha+) and false retrieval
(Hf) differed from hits followed by no cued retrieval (H-) at right prefrontal sites [800-1000 ms]. ERPs did not differ between correct and
incorrect retrieval. Ha+ and Hf share a higher cognitive demand: multiple memory traces are available - the encoded and the incorrect in case of
false retrieval; the encoded and the semantically-related in case of
ambiguous retrieval - and subjects perform a task-directed selection. The
inconsistent evidences noted by Schacter and Slotnick may depend on
different experimental designs. We suggest that the increased cognitive
load during strategic retrieval suffices to account for late higher right
frontal activity.

Explicit and implicit memory representations differ in their perceptual

tries at the level of feature processing can affect these differences in perceptual specificity. In an incidental study phase, two subject groups
performed a natural/artificial decision on centrally presented visual
objects. At test, new objects, identical repetitions and different exemplars
of study items were briefly presented in either the left or the right visual
field. Participants in the implicit group again performed the study task
whereas the explicit group was assigned a recognition memory task in
which both identical repetitions and different exemplars had to be
accepted as old (inclusion task). In the explicit task, reliable ERP old/
new effects emerged for both types of old items when stimuli were presented to the left hemisphere. With right hemisphere presentation, however, only identical repetitions but not different exemplars gave rise to
old/new effects. In contrast, ERP repetition priming effects in the
implicit task were elicited only by identical repetitions, irrespective of
presentation side. Our data thus corroborate a right hemisphere bias
towards differentiating specific exemplars and indicate that the focus of
left hemisphere processing can be subject to task demands. More importantly, hemispheric processing asymmetries proved to have a significant
impact on the perceptual specificity of implicit and explicit memory
access.

China, 3Peking University, Beijing, China, 4International Research Training
Group — Previous research showed that presence of a semantic link

between to-be-remembered items affects episodic associative recognition. Unrelated word pairs are retrieved on the basis of recollection, a
slow threshold mnemonic process typically found in associative recognition tests and thought to lead to retrieval of detailed item-in-context
information. In contrast, semantically related pairs are can also be recognized on the basis of familiarity, a relatively automatic strength-like
mnemonic process typically involved in retrieval of single item information. Using event-related potentials (ERP), we examine whether different
types of semantic relations, i.e., categorical, where items are characterized by a high-feature overlap (e.g., dancer- singer), and thematic, where
items are associated but do not share many common semantic features
(e.g., dancer- stage), differentially affect mechanisms involved in associative recognition in German participants. Results suggest that the two
types of semantic relations indeed differentially affect processes driving
associative recognition. Successful recognition of categorical pairs seems
to necessitate the involvement of recollection while familiarity appears
to be more diagnostic in the retrieval of thematic relations. To investigate
whether the observed pattern of results can be further generalized to the
speakers of languages other than German and, thus, be regarded as language/culture-independent, we ran a mirror experiment with Chinese
participants. The data indicates that the results of the two experiments
are largely comparable, and suggests that underlying semantic structure
has a similar impact on mnemonic processes engaged in episodic
retrieval for the speakers of both languages.

in which the noun was replaced by a synonym (semantic lures), recombined pairs (conjunction lures), and new items. Brain activity recorded

during the study phase of the experiment was backsorted based on subsequent memory (for old items) or subsequent memory errors (for the
parent items of lures). The results revealed Dm-like ERP effects that were
related to subsequent memory errors. Brain activity recorded during the
test phase of the experiment showed that participants were likely to predict the noun that they would see next when they were presented with
the adjective in a tested word pair. This predictive processing was also
related to the participants’ susceptibility to the lures. In both the study
and test phases, brain activity associated with memory errors differed
for the semantic and conjunction lures.

TRIPARTITE FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF EPISODIC MEMORY
RETRIEVAL Sze Chai Kwok1, Emiliano Macaluso1; 1Santa Lucia Foundation,
Rome — Episodic memory provides information about the ‘when’ of
events as well as ‘what’ and ‘where’ they happened. We investigated this
tripartite model of episodic memory using fMRI. Subjects watched a 45min TV episode (encoding, unscanned) and, 24 hours later, made discriminative choices of scenes from the clip during fMRI (retrieval). The
subject was presented with two scenes and was required to either choose
the scene that happened earlier in the film (temporal task), or the scene
with a correct spatial arrangement (spatial task), or the scene that had
been shown (object task). We identified a retrieval network comprising
posterior and superior parietal cortex, precuneus, middle frontal and
medial temporal areas. Direct comparisons between conditions exhibited
dissociations in the functional anatomy within the same experience. The
precuneus and the right parallel sulcus associated with retrieval of temporal order of events; and activity in the precuneus was modulated, in a
negative correlational manner, by the temporal distance between events.
We advocate the temporal task evoked a subjective, conscious self-percept experience during retrieval. Second, regions in the frontal and parietal cortices related to the recall of spatial information; the engagement
of the superior parietal areas was highlighted with control analyses
accounting for task difficulty and oculo-motor behaviour between conditions. Third, our data reflected the role of the anterior part of the hippocampus in object recognition after discounting spatio-temporal contexts.
This experiment confirms the assumption of domain-specific anatomical
dissociations and contributes to a tripartite content retrieval model.

NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS OF EVIDENCE IN PERCEPTUAL AND
MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS Alan Gordon1, Roozbeh Kiani1, William

Newsome1, Anthony Wagner1; 1Stanford University — Electrophysiological
and fMRI studies of non-human primates and humans demonstrate that
lateral parietal and prefrontal cortices are associated with the integration
of sensory information into decision variables that govern motor
responses. Recent work suggests that in source memory judgments similar cortical areas track the integration of competing mnemonic signals
into decision-variables. The present study employed multivariate pattern analysis of BOLD data to elucidate the extent to which the neural
mechanisms of mnemonic decision-making resemble those of perceptual
decision-making. In the perceptual task, human subjects viewed noisy
images of faces and houses and, when ready, reported the category of
the image and their confidence about the judgment. In the mnemonic
task, subjects first learned associations between randomly chosen
abstract nouns and images of specific faces and houses, and then, at test,
reported their choice and confidence about the category of the image
associated with each noun. A multi-voxel pattern classifier was trained
with independent data to dissociate patterns of distributed BOLD activity associated with perception of faces and houses. This classifier was
then presented with BOLD data from the two decision-making tasks,
enabling quantitative measures of the degree to which perceptual and
mnemonic evidence was present during each trial. Initial analyses demonstrate that estimates of neural evidence correlate with objective perceptual and mnemonic coherence, as well as subjective confidence
reports.

A DIFFERENTIATION ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION MEMORY: STRENGTHBASED MEMORY FOR FOIL EFFECTS FOUND IN PARIETAL CORTEX Amy
H. Criss1, Mark E. Wheeler2, James L. McClelland3; 1Syracuse University,

2Washington University, 3Stanford University — Differentiation

models of
recognition memory predict a strength based mirror effect (SBME) in the
distributions of subjective memory strength. Subjective memory
strength (e.g., familiarity) should increase for targets and simultaneously
decrease for foils following a strong encoding list compared to a weak
list. An alternative explanation for the SBME is that participants adopt a
stricter criterion following a strong list than a weak list. Behavioral
experiments support the differentiation account. Distributions for direct
ratings of memory strength follow predictions of differentiation models,
i.e., ratings are higher for targets and lower for foils following a strong
list. Reaction time distributions analyzed with Ratcliff's diffusion model
show greater rates of evidence accumulation (e.g., larger drift rates) for
foils and targets following a strong list. The purpose of this study was to
identify the neural bases for these differences. Encoding strength was
manipulated (strong, weak) in a rapid event-related fMRI paradigm. At
test, foils were presented in blocks containing strong or weak targets,
allowing us to investigate the effect of retrieval context on foils. Subjects
responded old/new with high or low confidence. Imaging analyses
identified eight regions, four in the left parietal cortex and two in the
right frontal cortex, in which activity increased faster for strong than
weak foils. These effects were observed only when confidence was high.
The results support a differentiation account of memory and indicate
that the left parietal and right frontal lobes play a key role in evaluating
evidence related to the memory decision, even for new items.

EFFECTS OF CONTEXTUAL KNOWLEDGE ON PROCESSING OF PLACES
AND FACES IN THE PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTEX: AN FMRI
INVESTIGATION Ingrid Olson1, Lars Ross2; 1Temple University, 2Albert
Einstein College of Medicine — Portions of the parahippocampal cortex
(PHC) have been suggested to play a specialized role in the encoding
and processing of scenic stimuli. However, others have proposed that
the fMRI activations in this region are due to contextual processing
rather than spatial or scenic processing per se. In this study we assessed
the influence of contextual knowledge on the engagement of the PHC
and the retrosplenial complex (RC) to unfamiliar, familiar, and famous
places and faces presumably differing substantially in associated contextual knowledge. We found that in the PHC the average BOLD response
to places was significantly larger than to faces regardless of associated
contextual knowledge. We observed a significant interaction between
stimulus class and contextual knowledge in the RC. In an additional
experiment we investigated the effect of contextual knowledge in previously unknown faces and places that was acquired in a preceding training session. Again, in both regions the BOLD response was significantly
larger in response to place- than to face stimuli, but no effect of context
was observed. These results confirm the role of the PHC in the processing of scenic stimuli but do not lend support for the notion that this
engagement is due to the contextual richness of the stimuli.

item recognition to the perirhinal cortex. Context was typically
addressed solely from the perspective of item memory. Here we applied
a novel measure of memory for context itself, while ensuring that it was
still cognitively processed incidentally at both study and test. Of interest
were the questions: 1) Will the same activation for context be observed
when memory for the context itself is measured and 2) Would a memory
trace for the context be affected by target status? 18 subjects were asked
at study to incidentally encode black target words (item) which were

superimposed on larger gray words (context) in composite stimuli. Participants were scanned during a subsequent recognition test where they
were asked to make an old-new judgment on the black word. Test
included four types of stimuli which were obtained by crossing the target-context dimension with old-new status. Memory for the context (old
vs. new) was assessed twice, once for each of the two target conditions.
This design enabled the definition of Hits and False alarms to be applied
not only to target items but also to the trial-by-trial changing context.
Anterior and posterior PHc activation patterns revealed significant interactions of context (old vs. new) with Response (“yes” vs. “no”). These
activations were completely lateralized by target condition. This triple
dissociation suggests that memory for context can be represented in one
of two distinct traces, one for context-item information and another for
context out of bound.

on recognition memory provide important insights into associative

that are processed simultaneously, but can also occur when items are
processed sequentially. We conducted a MEG study (N=40) of memory
for pairs of items encoded and retrieved sequentially, to identify neural
activity associated with the retrieval of inter-temporal associations. Participants studied pairs of successive objects pictures, and were asked to
make old-new judgments for each pair member, under 5 different
retrieval conditions: (1) Repeat: target old, context old – same; (2) Repair: target old, context old – different; (3) Target old, context new; (4)
Target new, context old; (5) Target new, context new. Activation patterns
at ~100ms, ~400ms, and ~700ms were associated with item recognition.
Beamformer analysis of this old-new effect revealed increased activation
for new items in right occipital regions and bilateral paracentral lobule at
~100ms, and increased activation for old items adjacent to right central
sulcus at ~700ms. Activation patterns at ~100ms, ~200ms, and ~400ms
were further modulated by temporal associations, with stronger activation for probes in the Repeat condition (in which probes were accompanied by their original contextual sequential pair-members) compared to
the Re-pair condition (in which probes were accompanied by studied
stimuli but not their original contextual sequential pair-members).
Beamformer analysis located increased activation for repeated vs. repaired pairs at ~400ms in occipital and temporal regions. These results
show dissociable modulations of event-related magnetic fields associated with item recognition and inter-temporal binding.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ASSOCIATION WITH INCREASED RESTING-STATE
CONNECTIVITY OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

Alisha Janssen1, Beth Patterson1, Amir Abduljalil1, Aaron Boster1, Ruchika
Shaurya Prakash1; 1The Ohio State University — Multiple Sclerosis is an
inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, resulting in physical, cognitive and affective disturbances. Among the wide range of cognitive dysfunction, individuals with MS experience a significant decline
in their capabilities to learn and retain new information. Episodic memory, through both lesion and neuroimaging studies of healthy adults, is
known to rely on the functioning of the medial temporal cortices, particularly the hippocampus. In this study, we examined if higher levels of
physical activity in MS individuals was associated with an increased
resting-state connectivity of the hippocampus and cortex, resulting in
improved performance on a task of episodic memory. Forty-five individuals with a clinically definite diagnosis of MS were recruited for the
study. All participants wore an accelerometer, and participated in a neuropsychological and imaging session. Seed-based connectivity analyses
were performed for each participant, suing the left and right hippocampi
as seeds of interest. Consistent with previous reports, hippocampus was
functionally connected to the precuneus, lateral parietal areas, posterior
cingulated cortex/retrosplenial cortex, and the medial frontal gyrus.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Higher levels of physical activity in MS patients were associated with an
increased coherence between the hippocampus and the posterior cingulated cortex/retrosplenial cortex. The increased connectivity between
these two regions, in turn, was predictive of better relational memory,
such that MS patients that showed increased coherence between the hippocampus and the posterior cingulated cortex/retrosplenial cortex also
showed better episodic memory. Increased resting-state connectivity
may be one pathway through which physical activity influences episodic
memory.

ANTICIPATORY HIPPOCAMPAL RESPONSES PREDICT INDIVIDUAL
DIFFERENCES IN REWARD-BASED MODULATION OF MEMORY Sasha

Wolosin1, Dagmar Zeithamova1, Alison Preston1; 1The University of Texas at
Austin — Emerging evidence suggests that medial temporal lobe (MTL)
memory processing is modulated by reward, resulting in enhanced
encoding of episodic information—long-term memory for events. Recent
neuroimaging research has further revealed activation in hippocampus
prior to stimulus presentation that predicts later memory performance,
suggesting that modulatory processes such as reward may influence
encoding processes in anticipation of upcoming events. Moreover, individual differences in neural responses to reward predict performance in
reinforcement learning paradigms. Such individual differences in
reward sensitivity may similarly influence the degree to which reward
impacts MTL encoding. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study examines (1) how cues indicating future rewards influence MTL subregional activation prior to
associative encoding and (2) how individual differences in reward sensitivity are reflected in MTL subregional activation. A high-value or lowvalue monetary cue preceded a pair of objects indicating potential
reward for successful retrieval of the association. Memory was tested
using a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. Behaviorally, memory
was superior for high-value associations relative to low-value associations. fMRI analysis revealed anticipatory responses within the hippocampus predicting memory formation that were further modulated by
reward. Importantly, the observed enhancement of anticipatory activation for high-value compared to low-value pairs correlated with individual differences in behavioral reward sensitivity (hit rate for high-value
pairs – hit rate for low-value pairs). The results suggest that rewardbased motivation influences memory by facilitating hippocampal encoding processes prior to stimulus presentation, and that increased behavioral sensitivity to reward is reflected by increases in reward effects
within the hippocampus.

SEQUENTIAL MEMORY RETENTION IN CHAOTIC NEURAL NETWORKS

Timothee Leleu1, Kazuyuki Aihara1; 1The University of Tokyo — Processing
sequences with neural systems, fundamental for applications such as
natural language processing, is at the center of attention of much
research. Early work by Elman and Pollack suggested that the memory
of past symbols can be encoded in the state-space of the processingunits, and that the formalism of dynamical systems was well-fitted to
describe neural dynamics. However, these simple networks were not
scalable. To overcome these limitations, reservoir computing, exploiting
the high-dimensionality of the state-space, and chaotic trajectories, was
proposed to allow decision-making without imposing unnatural internal
representations. We propose a paradigm for word memorization, adding
to the reservoir computing view a stabilization of the trajectories in the
case of recognized sequences. The formalism developed is based on a
model of discrete-time analog neurons, where the memory of past inputs
is encoded by a sparse population, fed by hot-one inputs and eventually
read by read-out units. The weights of the memory-encoding population
are normally distributed initially, and updated by a Hebbian-like rule
while a constant input is activated. As a consequence, weights are reorganized in a mixture of Gaussians, creating a new distribution of internal
states which remains stable after the input is removed. The analysis of
the statistical behavior of internal states, and numerical simulations,
181

Poster Session G — Monday, April 4, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
show that the Hebbian rule creates a hysteresis of the past state, by synchronizing two populations of neurons. The generalization of this result
may be at the basis of a robust (to input/synaptic noise and lags), scalable and realistic model for sequence processing.

PARIETAL ACTIVITY IS MODULATED BY FEELING OF KNOWING IN
EPISODIC AND SEMANTIC FACT RETRIEVAL Jeremy A. Elman1, Diane E.

Marian1, Alice Verstaen1, Arthur P. Shimamura1; 1University of California,
Berkeley — In neuroimaging studies, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC)
signals episodic retrieval (hits>correct rejections), though its exact role in
remembering remains unclear. Previous research has centered on studies
of word lists and yes/no recognition memory. We examined retrieval
related PPC activity using a “feeling of knowing” (FOK) paradigm for
factual information. Subjects were asked to learn 80 obscure facts (e.g.,
The name of the largest Confederate military prison during the Civil
War is…? Andersonville.). Subjects were scanned as they rated how
likely they would be able to provide the answer if given a recognition
test. We assessed FOK ratings for the recently learned facts (episodic
retrieval) and for previously known facts (semantic retrieval). PPC activity was modulated by FOK response (high>low) and this effect was
greater for recently learned facts compared to the retrieval of remote factual knowledge. These results suggest that retrieval related PPC activity
is sensitive to feeling of knowing, particularly for recently learned (i.e.,
episodic) information.

THE NEURAL MECHANISMS OF TEMPORAL AND SEMANTIC CONTIGUITY
EFFECTS IN FREE RECALL. Lucas Jenkins1, Sean Polyn2, Charan
Ranganath1; 1University of California at Davis, 2Vanderbilt University — Recent

computational models of verbal free recall have suggested that items
may be associated at encoding with a slowly-evolving contextual representation and that this representation may serve as a cue to reconstruct
the relative order of items at retrieval. These models predict that recall of
a previously studied word is more likely to be followed by recall of
words encoded in close temporal proximity (i.e. the temporal contiguity
effect). Here we used event-related fMRI to investigate the neural mechanisms that support encoding of these temporal associations as well as
those that support semantic associations. Participants were scanned
while encoding lists consisting of 24 words, a subset of which were
selected to share a moderate degree of semantic similarity (e.g. dish/
food). The 12 s interval between words was filled with an arithmetic distractor task to prevent rehearsal. Following each encoding period and an
additional 12 s filled delay, participants were cued to recall the words
from the previous list in any order. Preliminary analyses suggest that
activity in prefrontal and medial temporal lobe regions during encoding
was related to successful recall. Further analyses will be performed in
which multi-voxel pattern changes (cf. Jenkins & Ranganath, J. Neurosci.
2010) during encoding will be related to temporal and semantic contiguity (i.e. the tendency to cluster semantically related words) at recall.

AN FMRI STUDY OF SCENE CONSTRUCTION IN HIPPOCAMPALDAMAGED AMNESIC PATIENTS Sinead Mullally1, Demis Hassabis1,
Faraneh Vargha-Khadem1, Eleanor Maguire1; 1University College London,
London, UK — Patients with bilateral hippocampal damage and amnesia

are generally unable to imagine fictitious/future scenarios. However,
two patients can construct novel scenes/events despite dense amnesia
for autobiographical experiences, patient P01 (Hassabis et al., PNAS,
2007) and Jon (Maguire et al., Neuropsychologia, 2010). P01 became
amnesic in adulthood, while Jon has developmental amnesia. Both
patients have hippocampal volume reductions of ~50% bilaterally. We
sought to examine how these patients were able to construct scenes by
examining the underlying neural substrates using fMRI. For P01 there
was robust activation in the remnant of his right hippocampus during
scene construction, suggesting his ability may be hippocampal-dependent, which accords with his subjective experience of scene construction

182

as automatic and effortless. By contrast, Jon’s scene construction was
associated with increased activity in retrosplenial cortex, middle and
superior frontal gyri, with little activity in the medial temporal lobes.
This may reflect a compensatory mechanism, an account that supports
his description of scene construction as non-automatic and effortful.
Thus, while both patients can describe constructed scenes, only adultacquired damage case P01 does so spontaneously and engages what is
left of his hippocampus, in common with control participants (Hassabis
et al., J. Neuroscience, 2007). We suggest this basic scene construction
ability, whilst intact, is insufficient to support autobiographical memory.
By contrast, Jon’s early hippocampal damage and probable re-wiring of
his memory system, may permit a form of scene construction perhaps
based on his intact semantic memory that is, at the neural level, distinctly different from control participants.

SLEEP ENHANCES EMOTIONAL MEMORY AND PROTECTS EMOTIONAL
REACTIVITY Rebecca Spencer1, Bengi Baran1, Edward Pace-Schott1;
1Department

of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Massachusetts,
Amherst — Studies illustrating preferential sleep-dependent consolidation

of emotional memories led to the hypothesis that sleep deprivation may
reduce PTSD (Wagner et al., Biol Psych 2006). Conversely, others posit
that emotional memory consolidation reduces the emotional tone on the
memory (Walker & Stickgold, Nat Rev Neuro, 2009). However, studies
of emotional memory consolidation have failed to measure changes in
emotional reactivity. To address this, participants encoded negative and
neutral IAPS images and incidental memory for these items was tested
after a 12-hr interval either containing wake (n=25) or sleep (n=25). Negative items were recalled better than neutral items following sleep relative to wake. Importantly, for those who consolidated most over sleep,
subjective valence of negative images remained stable while those with
the least over-sleep improvement on negative items exhibited reduced
reactivity. This pattern was opposite of that observed following wake:
Those with the greatest accuracy for negative images after 12-hrs awake
exhibited the greatest reduction in emotional reactivity whereas those
with weak memory for negative items following wake had stable or
increased emotional reactivity. Morning and evening single-session control groups and physiological recordings (PSG) in the sleep group – illustrating correlations between sleep measures and performance changes –
collectively rule-out circadian and other accounts for these results. We
conclude that sleep protects the memory for emotional events as well as
the memory for the memory for the emotional tone experienced in conjunction with the emotional event. Conversely, memory enhancement
over wake reduces subjective emotionality, perhaps due to daytime
rumination.

DECODING OVERLAPPING MEMORIES IN THE HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS
USING HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI Martin J. Chadwick1, Demis Hassabis1,
Eleanor A. Maguire1; 1University College London, London, UK — We

used
fMRI to investigate the representational properties of episodic memories
in the human hippocampus where event content and spatial context
were not uniquely specified in any single memory, but instead overlapped between memories. In order to create episodes with overlapping
elements, we filmed two brief episodes against a green-screen background. We then superimposed each episode on the same two spatial
contexts, creating four movie clips which included every combination of
the two episodes and the two contexts. Prior to scanning, participants
(n=15) viewed the four movies. Each participant was then scanned using
high-resolution fMRI while they recalled the movies. The hippocampus,
entorhinal, perirhinal, and posterior parahippocampal cortices were
defined for each participant, and the voxel patterns from each region
were used in multivariate pattern classification analyses. Of all the
regions tested, only the classifier operating on the hippocampal voxels
displayed successful decoding of the four memories significantly above
chance. This result is consistent with the role of the hippocampus in both
episodic memory and pattern separation, and demonstrates that the hip-

pocampus contains specific information about memories even when
they contain highly overlapping elements. Our experimental design also
allowed the separate investigation of spatial and event information that
was in common between pairs of memories. For instance, memories A
and B had the same spatial context, but differing episodic contents. This
analysis showed that the hippocampus contained generalized information about spatial context, but not about episodic content, further underlining the role of the hippocampus in representing space.

THE ROLE OF ANTICIPATORY NEURAL ACTIVITY IN THE ENCODING OF
EMOTIONAL EVENTS Giulia Galli1, Noham Wolpe1, Leun J Otten1;
1University College London — Neural

activity elicited immediately before
an event can predict whether the event will later be remembered or forgotten. This suggests that memory formation is influenced by anticipatory mechanisms engaged ahead of stimulus presentation. Little is
known, however, about the relevance of anticipatory brain activity in the
formation of new emotional memories, and how this activity differs
between men and women. In this study we investigated sex differences
in anticipatory brain activity related to the encoding of emotional information. Event-related potentials were recorded from the scalps of
healthy adults while they performed an incidental encoding task on
pleasant, unpleasant and neutral pictures. Each picture was preceded by
a cue indicating the emotional valence of the impending picture. Memory was tested after a short delay with the Remember/Know procedure.
Memory performance did not differ between men and women. Sex differences emerged in encoding-related activity preceding unpleasant, but
not pleasant, pictures. In men, anticipatory activity before unpleasant
events was short-lived and left-lateralized relative to the activity
observed in women. Surprisingly, sex differences also emerged in the
magnitude of encoding-related activity preceding neutral events. In conclusion, anticipatory neural activity can predict successful memory formation of emotional events. However, men and women anticipate the
encoding of emotional events differently. Potential clinical implications
for psychiatric disorders will be discussed.

PAIN ENHANCES MEMORY CONSOLIDATION FOR ORIGINALLY NEUTRAL
IMAGES Ulrike Schwarze1, Ulrike Bingel2, Tobias Sommer1; 1Department of
Systems Neuroscience, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,
Germany, 2Department of Neurology, University Medical Center HamburgEppendorf, Germany — The perception of pain is an aversive emotional
event. In general, emotional events are better remembered than neutral
ones. But, studies investigating pain have shown diminished memory
performance for concomitantly presented information. However, when
pain is present throughout the experiment, it is not clear whether the
effects on memory are mediated by disturbed attentional or visual processes. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether pain
influences memory performance also when it is applied shortly after
stimulus perception. Healthy participants encoded 80 neutral images.
Half of the images were randomly followed by an electrical painful stimulus which was adjusted to the individual pain threshold. Recognition
was either probed on the same or the following day with 20 subjects in
each group. While pain did not affect immediate recognition performance, images paired with pain were better remembered than neutral
images when tested on the following day. Therefore, pain seems to
improve the consolidation of associated images. An fMRI-study using
the same paradigm showed that a subsequent memory effect for pictures
paired with pain compared to neutral ones was associated with prolonged and enhanced activation of the right fusiform gyrus. Thus, pain
influences activity in a brain area incorporated in successful memory formation. In conclusion, pain enhances memory for images by influencing
consolidation processes rather than initial encoding when delivered subsequently to these images. This finding is in line with previous studies
showing more efficient consolidation based on emotional arousal and
resultant enhanced memory performance for emotional events.

THE COMPLEX PATTERN OF VENTRAL STRIATAL ACTIVITY DURING
RECOGNITION Tobias Sommer1, Ulrike Bingel1, Ulrike Schwarze1; 1Dept. of
Systems Neuroscience, University Medical College Hamburg — The activity
difference between successful recognized old items (‘hits’) and correctly
rejected lures (‘correct rejections’) in a standard recognition test is
termed the retrieval success effect. This contrast is associated with a
greater activity in the medial temporal, parietal and frontal regions.
However, also the ventral striatum, a brain area traditionally linked to
reward processing, is frequently associated with this contrast. Recently it
was suggested that the activity increase in this area reflects the subjective
motivational preference to reach an old decision in standard memory
tests (Han et al., 2010). The aim of the current study was to further elucidate the role of the ventral striatum during recognition. 19 subjects were
scanned during a recognition test for pictures encoded the day before.
Subjects indicated their confidence on a 6 point scale (1- ‘sure old’, 6 –
‘sure new’). Crucially, the analysis of activity was not restricted to hits
and correct rejections but took also misses and false alarms into account.
Besides the retrieval success effect, also the main effects of confidence
and the subjective memory status, i.e. ‘old’ vs. ‘new’ responses, are correlated with striatal activity. Moreover, the old-new effect is greater for
correct than incorrect responses and the slope of confidence if steeper for
old items. The partial co-localization of these analyze is supported by a
formal conjunction analysis of these contrasts. In conclusion, the striatal
activity during recognition reveals a more complex pattern than previously reported and more than one process might contribute to the
retrieval success effect.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ERPS AT ENCODING AND RETRIEVAL OF
MEMORY Yvonne Chen1, Kirstie Lithgow2, Jumjury Hemmerich1, Jeremy

Caplan1,2; 1Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, 2Centre for
Neuroscience, University of Alberta — Memory reflects the trajectory of an

item from encoding to retrieval. Therefore, a main goal of electrophysiology of memory research should be to understand the relationship
between memory-related ERPs at study (known as the “Dm” or “subsequent memory effect”, SME) and memory-related ERPs at test (known as
the “old/new effect”). Although SMEs and old/new effects have been
analyzed independently, even within the same study, it is unclear how
components relate to one another. For example, the Late Positive Component (LPC) of the SME and the (early) FN400 old/new effect have
both been linked to shallow levels of representation (rote rehearsal and
familiarity-based recognition; Karis et al., 1984 Warren, 1980). Similarly,
the slow wave SME and the Late Parietal Component of the old/new
effect have both been linked to deep levels of representation (semantic
processing and recollection-based recognition). We tested this apparent
alignment (LPC with FN400 and slow wave with Late Parietal Component) by asking whether they explain common variance across participants. 60 participants studied and were given recognition tests on 9 lists
of 25 items. We correlated both SMEs with both old/new effects across
participants. The FN400 did not correlate significantly with the LPC or
the slow wave. Contrary to our hypothesis, the late parietal component
correlated significantly with the LPC (Spearman’s rho(56) = 0.28, p<0.05)
and positively, although not significantly, with the slow wave. This pattern of findings suggests that ERPs at study and test may require a subtler cognitive interpretation.

EFFECTS OF STRESS IN EPISODIC MEMORY UPDATING Bhaktee

Dongaonkar1, Lynn Nadel1; 1University of Arizona — It has been recently
shown that episodic memory can be updated. Updating occurs only
when a prior memory is reactivated before another episode of learning
similar information. Without reactivation, new learning is not integrated
with old learning. We decided to explore the effects of stress on the
updating effect. Participants learned a set of 20 objects (Set 1) on Day 1.
Two days later on Day 2, participants were either stressed or not

183

Poster Session G — Monday, April 4, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
stressed. Next they were or were not reminded of their learning on Day
1. They then learned another set of 20 objects (Set 2). Forty eight hours
later, on Day 3, all participants had to recall Set 1 objects. There was no
difference in the Set 1 recall performance between groups. Participants
who received a reminder but were not stressed recalled higher number
of objects from Set 2 (intrusions) which evidences the updating effect.
Those participants who were stressed before the reminder show a trend
of fewer objects from Set 2 being recalled as Set 1 objects compared to
non-stressed participants. This may suggest that stress prevents updating of Set 1 with Set 2 objects. This may have implications for learning
under stress and problem solving.

ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR HIPPOCAMPAL CONNECTIVITY DURING THE
ENCODING OF FUTURE SIMULATIONS Victoria C. Martin1, Daniel L.

Schacter2, Michael Corballis1, Donna Rose Addis1; 1The University of
Auckland, 2Harvard University — Some hippocampal regions are preferentially recruited for imagined future events relative to remembered past
events. To investigate the basis of this increased activity, we recently had
25 healthy participants imagine future events in response to person,
location, and object cue sets in an fMRI scanning session, followed by a
post-scan cued recall test probing memory for these event details. We
showed that anterior and posterior regions of the right hippocampus are
more active for later-remembered imagined future events than later-forgotten ones, suggesting that the increased hippocampal activity seen for
future events reflects, at least in part, the process of encoding these scenarios into memory. To examine how these two regions contribute to
encoding of future events, we examined the connectivity of the anterior
and posterior clusters. They were entered into a multivariate seed partial
least squares (PLS) analysis, with the aim of identifying networks that
are functionally connected to these seeds during successful and unsuccessful encoding. Both the anterior and posterior seeds showed common
functional connectivity to core autobiographical network regions (e.g.
medial frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus) when
imagined future events were later remembered. However, only the anterior seed showed this same connectivity when the events were later forgotten. This finding demonstrates that the contribution of both
hippocampal regions is crucial for the successful encoding of future simulations, and that the anterior cluster may reflect a process that is beneficial to but not sufficient for encoding, such as the recombination of event
details into a novel scenario.

THE EFFECTS OF POST-ENCODING STRESS ON RECOLLECTION AND
FAMILIARITY FOR EMOTIONAL AND NEUTRAL IMAGES Andrew

McCullough1, Andrew Yonelinas1; 1University of California Davis — A variety
of empirical techniques have shown that post-encoding stress can affect
recall performance, and that the emotionality of the to-be-remembered
information may interact with the effects of stress. However, the specific
nature of stress effects on memory processes is unclear. Recognition
tasks provide a useful approach for exploring how stress affects the processes supporting memory performance. The current research investigated how a laboratory stressor (i.e., the cold-pressor task) affects
recognition memory by comparing performance of participants exposed
to post-encoding stress with participants in a non-stressed control condition. Recognition was assessed for negative and neutral photographs
using a hybrid remember/know confidence procedure in order to characterize overall performance and to separate recollection- and familiarity-based responses. Preliminary analysis indicates that post-encoding
stress significantly improved recognition memory relative to the control
condition. Subsequent analyses will examine whether the stress-related
memory improvements influenced recollection and/or familiarity and
whether these effects were modulated by the arousal level of the materials. The results suggest that physiological stress can significantly
enhance memory for information encountered prior to the stressful
event.

CLASSIFICATION Tracy H. Wang1,2, Jeffrey D. Johnson1,3, Michael D.

Rugg1,2; 1University of California, Irvine, 2The University of Texas at Dallas,
University of Missouri — Cortical reinstatement refers to overlap between

3

the patterns of neural activity elicited during the encoding and the subsequent retrieval of an episode, and is thought to underlie recollection of
episode-specific information. The current experiment used multi-voxel
pattern analysis to determine the relationship between cortical reinstatement, recollection and familiarity during retrieval of visual and auditory
contextual information. At study, subjects (N=18) were presented with a
series of pictures of objects. Each picture was accompanied either by a
visually- or an auditorily-presented word. The study task was to determine whether the object denoted by the word corresponded to the picture. Test items comprised previously presented and new pictures. The
test task required one of four responses: ‘remember’ (recollection of a
study detail), ‘familiar’ (confident recognition in the absence of recollection), ‘new’ and ‘guess’. fMRI data from the encoding phase were
employed to train a classifier to discriminate between visual and auditory study trials. fMRI data from the test phase were then analyzed with
the same classifier in order to assess its ability to discriminate between
studied pictures according to the modality of the word that had accompanied each picture at study. The classifier performed significantly
above-chance for items endorsed as recollected, but was unable to reliably classify trials endorsed as familiar. These findings converge with
prior results to suggest that cortical reinstatement is stronger for items
that elicit a phenomenological sense of recollection than it is for items
recognized on the basis of an acontextual sense of familiarity.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF CRITERION SHIFTING IN MEMORY Elissa

Aminoff1, Scott Freeman1, David Clewett1, Christine Tipper1, Amy Frithsen1,
Arianne Johnson1, Scott Grafton1, Michael Miller1; 1University of California,
Santa Barbara — Decision criterion plays an important role in recognition
memory; it is this threshold used to determine whether there is enough
evidence to consider an item as something previously encountered. A
conservative criterion designates more items as new, and a liberal criterion designates more items as previously studied. Optimal decisionmaking may require criterion to flexibly adapt in response to changing
information (e.g., base rate). Thus, the ability to flexibly shift criterion
can have a direct influence on recognition memory performance. In the
current study, we used fMRI to examine criterion shifting in recognition
memory using two separate memory tests with data from ninety-five
participants. Our results uncover the neural correlates of criterion shifting in recognition memory, which span regions of the lateral prefrontal
and parietal cortices, specifically within posterior prefrontal cortex and
superior parietal cortex. Investigating individual differences within the
fMRI data reveal that the strategy adopted (e.g., criterion shifting) had a
profound effect on the activity elicited from neural regions recruited for
successful memory. The results of this study also functionally differentiated the large regions of the frontal and parietal cortices related to recognition memory, isolating those regions specifically related to the
recognition memory judgment and criterion shifting. The results of this
study provide insight into the function of lateral regions of the prefrontal
and parietal cortices and into the neural mechanisms underlying recognition memory. Supported by Army Research Office Contract W911NF07-1-0072 with the Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies at UC

tation of the temporal context. Little is known about how the brain
represents temporal context, but some computational models suggest
that neural oscillations might play an important role. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the role of oscillatory brain
activity in the recovery of temporal context information. Subjects
encoded a series of fractals, and at test, they alternated between pleasantness judgments on previously studied items and recognition memory
judgments on studied and unstudied items. On "Temporally Contiguous" (CT) trials, items shown during the pleasantness and recognition
judgments were items that had been presented in succession during the
encoding phase. On temporally incontiguous trials (ICT), the items
shown during the pleasantness and recognition judgments had been
studied in separate encoding blocks. Results from a behavioral study
indicated that recollection-based recognition was significantly higher on
CT trials than on ICT trials, suggesting that reinstantiating temporal context on CT trials facilitated recognition of the temporally contiguous
item. Preliminary analyses of data from the EEG study indicated that
oscillatory activity in the theta band (4-8 Hz) was enhanced during processing of temporally contiguous cues, relative to incontiguous cues.
Further analyses will investigate oscillatory activity related to temporal
context encoding.

Medicine and Semel Institute For Neuroscience and Human Behavior,
University of California, Los Angeles, CA., 4Department of Psychology, UC
Davis — Prior studies have demonstrated movement-related increases in
theta oscillations in rodents and recent evidence suggests that multiple
navigationally relevant variables are reflected in rodent hippocampal
theta activity. Human invasive recordings have revealed movement
related modulations in theta activity, although it is not known if additional behavioral variables are responsible for modulating this neural
activity during navigation. We sought to test the role of theta oscillations
during navigation by addressing whether spatial-related processing, in
addition to speed and task-related variables, modulates theta activity.
Analysis of 317 hippocampal intracranial electrodes in ten patients
undergoing surgery monitoring revealed increasing delta and theta
power with increasing virtual speed at significantly more electrode sites
than would be expected by chance, replicating and extending previous
findings in lower mammals. However, low frequency power was more
consistently modulated as a function of spatial-view, which included
when subjects looked at stores in the virtual environment both to find a
relevant goal or for spatial updating. A larger proportion of electrodes
showed view-related modulations than speed-related modulations.
Although speed, task, and spatial-view affected theta activity, individual
electrodes were most frequently modulated by only one of these variables, rather than a combination of variables. One interpretation of these
findings is that these electrodes sampled independent theta generators,
which reflected movement-related and allocentric processing, respectively. These results replicate and extend previous findings in both nonhuman mammals and humans, expanding our knowledge of the role of
hippocampal low-frequency oscillations generally in navigation.

Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies of recognition memory
have reported that amount of perceptual overlap between study and test

mid-frontal and left parietal ‘old/new’ effects, respectively. Participants
(N=17) made animacy decisions to intermixed visually presented words
and pictures. The following test phase comprised words only; some of
these were presented at study, some were names of studied pictures ,
and the remainder were unstudied. Instructions were to endorse items
as ‘remembered’ if detail of the study presentation could be retrieved
and if not, to judge the old/new status of the item using a 4-point confidence scale (confident old to confident new; assumed to reflect familiarity strength). Relative to new items attracting low ratings of familiarity
strength, old test items rated highly familiar elicited a reliable mid-frontal effect regardless of study format, suggesting that the mid-frontal
effect is not affected by degree of perceptual overlap between study and
test. The later-onsetting left-parietal effect was greater for items corresponding to studied words than to studied pictures, which suggests that
perceptual overlap between study and test items led to recollection of
more information than when overlap was conceptual only. Together,
these findings suggest that the neural correlates of familiarity and recollection are differentially affected by the amount of perceptual overlap
between study and test.

THE EFFECTS OF LATERAL PREFRONTAL THETA-BURST STIMULATION ON
ITEM MEMORY ENCODING Robert Blumenfeld1, Antonio Fidalgo2, Mark

D'Esposito1; 1Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute and Department of
Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, 2Department of Surgery and
Cancer, Imperial College London — Over twelve years of functional neuroimaging research investigating long-term memory encoding has established that activity in left inferior frontal gyrus (Lifg) correlates with
subsequent memory for individual items. Activity in left middle frontal
gyrus (Lmfg) is rarely correlated with subsequent memory for items but
rather has been shown to correlate with subsequent memory for interitem relational information. Surprisingly, most studies investigating the
causal role of prefrontal subregions using repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), implicate Lmfg and not Lifg in item memory
encoding. However, few studies have actually targeted Lifg and most
studies relied upon imprecise scalp-based landmarks rather than anatomical landmarks to define prefrontal targets. Furthermore, no study, to
our knowledge, has directly compared effects of rTMS on Lifg and Lmfg
in a single experiment. Thus in the present study, we used repetitive
theta-burst stimulation (rTBS) on precisely defined Lifg and Lmfg targets to investigate whether the function of these regions are critical to
normal item memory encoding. Thirty seconds of rTBS was administered prior to an encoding task in which participants were presented
with a list of individual nouns and asked to judge whether each noun
was concrete or abstract. After a 40 minute filled delay period, item recognition memory was tested. Preliminary results indicate that rTBS to
Lifg leads to an impairment in item memory relative to vertex rTBS and
secondly, rTBS to LmFG has little affect on item memory performance
compared to vertex rTBS.

WAKE DETERIORATION AND SLEEP RESTORATION OF HUMAN
LEARNING Bryce Mander1, Sangeetha Santhanam1, Matthew Walker1;

1
University of California, Berkeley — In contrast to consolidation, the role of
sleep in facilitating the initial stage of memory encoding remains largely
uncharacterized. NREM sleep-oscillations have been proposed to restore
neural dynamics supporting optimal memory processing. Here we test
the hypothesis that episodic learning ability deteriorates with continued
time awake, but that NREM sleep-spindle oscillations restore such hippocampal encoding capacity. Thirty-nine participants (20.7±0.3 years)
performed two separate episodic memory-encoding sessions: 12:00 and
18:00. After the first learning session participants either remained awake
for 6 hr (No-Nap group; n=19), or obtained a 100-minute high-density
EEG monitored sleep period (Nap-group; n=20). Episodic learning ability was measured using a face-name associative encoding task known to
demand hippocampal-dependent processes. Face-name encoding capacity deteriorated across the 6hr waking interval in the No-Nap group, yet

185

Poster Session G — Monday, April 4, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
sleep blocked this deterioration in the Nap-group, and actually
enhanced learning capacity (p=0.049). The restoration of learning capacity in the Nap-group correlated significantly with NREM stage-2 sleep
(p=0.015), and specifically the number of fast sleep-spindles over left
prefrontal cortex (p=0.018). EEG source-mapping analysis of these spindles revealed a time-series of current-density activity repeating through
the left temporal lobe. No relationships between slow wave oscillations
in NREM sleep and learning were detected. Together, these findings
demonstrate that episodic learning ability is not stable across a waking
day, deteriorating over a 6-hr period. However, sleep, and specifically
NREM stage-2 fast spindles, restored this hippocampal-dependent
encoding capacity. Such evidence supports a model of sleep-dependent
hippocampal-neocortical memory transfer, which, as a consequence,
reinstates efficient next-day learning ability.

THE NEURAL BASIS OF THE GENERATION EFFECT Zachary

Arthur Shimamura1; 1University of California, Berkeley — Previous

Rosner1,

research
has demonstrated that actively generating verbal responses such as
semantic associates, antonyms, or rhymes to word cues facilitates
retrieval of these items compared to passively reading the same information. This memory phenomenon, known as the generation effect, is
robust, though the neural circuit underlying this effect is unknown.
Some suggest that the effect is related to an increase in attention to the
target stimulus, while others claim that generation increases conceptual
processing. We scanned subjects using fMRI at encoding and retrieval to
explore the neural basis of the generation effect. In the study phase, participants either generated a target synonym from a cue (e.g. cool-c_ld) or
read that same information (e.g. cool-cold). At test, participants saw generated items, read items, and new items and were asked to indicate
whether each item was old or new with confidence ratings. Replicating
previous findings, synonym generation provided a strong benefit for
item recognition. During the encoding phase, there was increased activation for items generated compared to read in regions including the inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, which have been implicated
in refreshing previously activated information. Additionally, there was
increased activity in the left superior and inferior parietal lobules, areas
which demonstrate subsequent memory effects. Further, these differences persisted when controlling for recognition and confidence. These
findings suggest that active generation may not only enhance memory in
a quantitative fashion, but rather changes in a qualitative manner the
way which information is encoded.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF ACROSS-MODALITY MULTIFEATURAL
ENCODING Lauren Gottlieb1, Michael Rugg1; 1University of California,
Irvine — fMRI subsequent memory effects predictive of successful source
memory dissociate according to the source feature(s) that are remembered. Furthermore, subsequent memory effects associated with the
memory for multiple visual features have been identified in regions
additional to those associated with the retrieval of either feature alone,
suggesting that these additional regions play a role in ‘feature binding’
at the time of encoding. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of the
conjoint encoding of visual and auditory contextual features. Subjects
were scanned while they studied a series of pictures, each paired with an
auditory word, judging whether the word denoted the pictured object.
The pictures were presented to the left or right, and the words were spoken in a male or a female voice. At test, subjects determined whether
each picture was old or new. If a picture was judged old, two source
judgments ensued, about the location of the studied picture, and the gender in which the associated word was spoken. Relative to study items
later misclassified as new or associated with two incorrect source judgments, subsequent memory effects associated with memory for either
location or voice alone were identified in distinct cortical regions. Effects
uniquely predictive of memory for both features were identified in right
lateral occipito-temporal cortex. These findings add to the evidence that
subsequent memory effects differ according to the nature of the encoded

186

contextual feature, and suggest that the ‘binding’ of auditory and visual
features is supported at the cortical level.

G84
DISSOCIATION OF PRESTIMULUS SUBSEQUENT MEMORY EFFECTS BY
STUDY TASK Marianne de Chastelaine1, Michael D Rugg1; 1University of
California, Irvine — Previous research has demonstrated that neural activity during the interval between a warning cue and a study item can predict whether or not the item will be remembered on a later memory test.
We have hypothesized that such prestimulus subsequent memory
effects are a reflection of the adoption of an optimal preparatory state
ahead of an upcoming stimulus event. Here we employed fMRI to investigate whether this state is task-specific or task-general. We employed
two study tasks that have previously been shown to doubly dissociate
both item- and state-related subsequent memory effects. Eighteen young
participants were scanned while study words were visually presented.
Cues presented prior to each word denoted whether the word should be
subjected to an animacy or a syllable (odd or even number?) judgment.
To allow cue- and item-related activity to be deconvolved, the cue-item
interval varied randomly between 1s, 3s and 5s. Following the study
phase, a surprise recognition memory test was administered in which
each test item had to be endorsed as ‘Remembered’, ‘Known’ or ‘New’.
Task–selective prestimulus subsequent recollection (R>K) effects were
uniquely evident in the right parahippocampal cortex for cues preceding
an animacy judgment, and in left inferior frontal gyrus for cues preceding a syllable judgment. These findings add to the evidence that prestimulus neural activity is an important determinant of successful episodic
memory encoding. They also indicate that, as reported for putative itemrelated subsequent memory effects, the loci of prestimulus effects are
sensitive to the nature of the associated study task.

MEMORY, VISUAL DISCRIMINATION PERFORMANCE, AND THE HUMAN
HIPPOCAMPUS Soyun Kim1, Annette Jeneson1, Anna van der Horst1,

California, San Diego, California, 2Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, San
Diego, California, 3Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, 4Intermountain
Medical Center, Murray, Utah — We evaluated recent proposals that the
hippocampus supports certain kinds of visual discrimination performance, for example when spatial processing is required and the stimuli
have a high degree of feature overlap. Patients with circumscribed hippocampal lesions tried to discriminate between images of similar faces
or images of similar scenes. In one condition, elements of the stimulus
display repeated from trial to trial, and in another condition every trial
was unique. In the repeated condition for both faces and scenes, controls
gradually improved their performance across testing. In the trial-unique
condition, no improvement occurred. The patients were impaired for
both faces and scenes in the repeated condition where controls could
benefit from learning. However, the patients were fully intact in the trialunique condition. The results suggest that previous reports of impaired
discrimination performance after medial temporal lobe damage may
reflect impaired learning rather than impaired visual perception. The
findings support the fundamental idea that memory is a distinct cerebral
function separable from other perceptual and cognitive abilities.

THE UPS AND DOWNS OF HIPPOCAMPAL MODULATION: MNEMONIC
CONSEQUENCES OF MEMORY CONTROL Justin Hulbert1,2, Michael

Anderson2; 1University of Cambridge, 2MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences
Unit — People often try to control which memories enter awareness, and
these efforts have been shown to have lasting consequences for the later
accessibility of suppressed memories. In the Think/No-Think (TNT)
procedure used to study such control, intentionally suppressing retrieval
leads to a reduction, rather than an augmentation, in hippocampal activity. We hypothesized that this modulation would alter one’s ability to
encode and consolidate novel information presented between TNT trials.
Specifically, attempts to suppress retrieval prior to an incidental-encod-

ing task should disrupt encoding, whereas suppressing retrieval after
incidental encoding should truncate ongoing consolidation. In the current series of studies, we employed the novel Hippocampal Modulation
(H.M.) paradigm, in which participants confronted novel stimuli presented between TNT trials. Both source recognition memory and cuedrecall for items presented around suppression trials were significantly
impaired. Thus, engaging cognitive control to suppress retrieval can be
adaptive for preventing unwanted memories from entering awareness,
but detrimental to the encoding or retention of experiences in the temporal surround. The H.M. paradigm offers a means of selectively and temporarily modulating the hippocampus in healthy human participants,
thereby providing a non-invasive, focused method to study the functions of the hippocampus. The current results indicate that, as a result of
suppressing unwanted thoughts, one is disadvantaged for learning new
mnemonic connections. Individuals who chronically suppress memories
could fall victim to extensive gaps in memory resulting from their coping strategy. Adopting alternative strategies to deal with unwanted
thoughts that do not induce a hippocampal deactivation may be preferable in these circumstances.

MULTIMODAL IMAGING REVEALS THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF
CONTENT GENERAL AND CONTENT SPECIFIC NEURAL PROCESSES IN
EPISODIC RETRIEVAL Zara Bergström1, Richard Henson2, Jon Simons1;
1University

of Cambridge, 2MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
Cambridge — Previous research has shown that whereas some brain activ-

ity patterns during episodic retrieval appear to be content general, different patterns of prefrontal cortical (PFC) brain activity are elicited
depending on whether the task requires recall of externally or internally
generated information, as indicated by both fMRI (Simons et al., 2005)
and EEG methods (Herron & Wilding, 2004). To our knowledge however, no one has yet related these effects across imaging modalities. In
the current study, we collected fMRI and EEG/MEG data from the same
group of participants who completed an identical source memory task in
two sessions. Participants studied pictures of famous faces presented
either on the left or the right of the screen and made either a semantic or
pleasantness judgement on each trial. In a subsequent memory test, they
were asked to remember either the previous location of a face (external
source) or which judgment they had made on the face (internal source).
External and internal source retrieval was contrasted and compared
against a semantic retrieval control condition. General source retrieval
was associated with fMRI activation in a typical episodic fronto-parietal
network, and with both early and late EEG and MEG modulations with
left parietal/right frontal maxima. Recollection of internal source details
was associated with greater activation in several PFC areas, and more
broadly distributed late EEG and MEG slow-drifts. The results demonstrate converging effects across imaging modalities and contribute to our
understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of content general and
content specific brain processes in episodic retrieval.

AGING EFFECTS ON VISUAL CORTEX ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH
SUCCESSFUL PICTURE RECOLLECTION Sasha C. Cervantes1, Ian M.

McDonough1, David A. Gallo1; 1University of Chicago — We used fMRI to
investigate the effects of healthy aging on brain activity associated with
complex picture recollection. Previous neuroimaging studies have found
reactivation of visual regions when participants recollect studied pictures from memory, but no study has investigated parametric changes in
memory reactivation as a function of age. In the current study, younger
and older adults studied pictures of complex scenes (e.g., people and
objects in naturalistic settings) just prior to the brain scan. Each picture
was associated with a unique label describing the scene. These labels
were then used as retrieval cues on the memory test, which was administered using an event-related fMRI design. For each label participants
were instructed to recollect the corresponding picture and to rate the
amount of retrieved details from ‘0’ (none) to ‘3’ (high). We found that
memory-related reactivation of visual regions (e.g., lingual gyrus) more

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

strongly tracked the amount of recollected details in younger adults than
in older adults. However, these aging effects were less pronounced
when objective memory accuracy was equated between the age groups,
as indicated by a two-alternative forced choice test administered after
the scan. These findings suggest that aging effects on memory reactivation may be primarily caused by reductions in the amount of recollected
details, as opposed to aging effects on the memory reactivation processes
itself.

G89
INVESTIGATING FAMILIARITY'S CONTRIBUTION TO SOURCE
RECOGNITION Matthew Mollison1, Tim Curran1; 1University of Colorado at
Boulder — It has been debated whether source information for encoded
items (i.e., contextual associations from when the items were previously
encountered) is only accessible through recollection, or whether familiarity can contribute to successful source recognition. Prior research has
shown that familiarity can assist in perceptual source monitoring when
the source attribute is an intrinsic property of the item (e.g., an object's
surface color). However, few studies have researched familiarity's contribution to recognizing extrinsic source associations that are independent from the item itself. We examined behavioral and EEG-based
familiarity measures in two experiments using extrinsic perceptual
sources. In Experiment 1 the source context was an extrinsic color border
associated with each item, and Experiment 2 used spatial location as
extrinsic source information. The FN400 event-related potential component, associated with familiarity, showed an effect for source recognition
accuracy of previously encoded items only when spatial location, but not
color, was used as a source characteristic. Additionally, behavioral
results revealed above chance source accuracy for items judged to feel
familiar. These results are surprising in light of familiarity being previously found to contribute to source recognition only when the source
information was intrinsically bound to the item, and they show that
familiarity can be used to successfully monitor extrinsic sources.

1Department

Boulder, 2C-TRIC and Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, University
of Colorado Denver — We investigated the role of the parietal cortex in recollecting the study orientation of pictures. For each subject we measured
event-related potentials (ERPs) and fMRI in different sessions of a recognition task. Previously studied pictures were tested in either the same or
different (mirror image) orientation. Participants made orientation judgments for old pictures. While holding other recollection processes constant, we analyzed the contrast between mirror-image and same-image
conditions in order to test the effect of active episodic recall of studied
pictures, which is stronger for mirror images. In fMRI, mirror-image as
opposed to same-image recollection was associated with stronger bilateral activation in all parietal retrieval-success regions includinhg the
superior (BA 7) and inferior (BA 40) parietal lobe, precuneus (BA 7),
supramarginal cortex (BA 40), and angular cortex (BA 39). The ERP parietal old/new effect, observed between 500 and 800 ms after target onset
and taken as an indicator of recollection, showed significant correlations
with activation in left, parietal retrieval-success regions. Larger ERP
parietal old/new effects for mirror images than same images were correlated with larger mirror/same fMRI activation differences in left superior (BA7) and left inferior (BA 40) parietal cortex. These results show
that all retrieval success regions in the parietal cortex contribute to active
episodic recall and that individual differences in the ERP parietal old/
new effect are related to fMRI activation in the left parietal cortex.

RECOGNITION MEMORY FOR REAL-WORLD SCENES IS SUPPORTED BY
RECOLLECTION: INTERPRETING FRONTALLY DISTRIBUTED EVENTRELATED POTENTIAL OLD/NEW EFFECTS Graham MacKenzie1, John M
Henderson2; 1University of Edinburgh, 2University of South Carolina — Event-

related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate recognition memory
for scenes. Dual process models propose that familiarity and recollection
support recognition and ERP studies have identified neural signatures
for each retrieval process. Familiarity has been associated with a midfrontal old/new effect (300 – 500ms) and recollection with a left parietal
effect (500 – 800ms). However, the generality of these retrieval processes
has been challenged by unfamiliar face recognition studies, which suggest that recollection may be material specific because context retrieval
can elicit frontal activity. In the present study, participants studied
scenes while attending to their orientation; at test, half the studied scenes
were presented in the same orientation (studied) and half were mirrorreversed (similar). Participants were instructed to press ‘yes’ for studied
scenes and to press ‘no’ for similar and new scenes. ERP old/new effects
for studied hits and similar false alarms were maximal over frontal scalp
from 500 – 800ms; the effects differed quantitatively (studied ‘yes’ > similar ‘yes’) but not qualitatively. Mid-frontal effects (300 – 500ms) associated with familiarity were not reliable. The old/new effect observed for
scenes appears to reflect recollection due to its resemblance to effects
observed for unfamiliar faces and the absence of the typical familiarity
index. These findings extend the range of ERP studies showing that recollection can display material specific neural signatures. Recognition
memory for scenes is supported by recollection; qualitatively similar
effects for hits and false alarms to mirror-reversed scenes indicate that
when orientation is not retrieved other contextual information is recollected.

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF EPISODIC MEMORY USING A WHAT-WHEREWHEN DESIGN Ruth M. Johnson1, Stephanie J. Babb1, A. Cris Hamilton2,
Laura B. Hawkins1; 1University of Houston-Downtown, 2Rice University — Tulv-

ing (1972) defined episodic memory as a distinct memory system that
focuses on recollections of personally-experienced events in the past,
and the spatial and temporal relations of those events (i.e., what, where,
and when). This study characterized the cortical mechanisms for processing episodic memory using the behavioral criteria of what (object),
where (spatial arrangement), and when (temporal order). During the
functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, participants were
shown 80 unique visual scenes of the interiors of furnished homes across
four blocks of 20 trials each. After viewing 20 visual scenes for 4 seconds
each, participants were randomly given 5 trials of each of the four conditions (What, Where, When, and Control). Participants’ accuracy and
reaction time were examined with respect to memory for what, where,
and when. Cortical activations were found in the left middle frontal
gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus during the What condition, right
superior parietal lobe during the Where condition, and right middle
frontal gyrus during the When condition. Functional activations were
also found in the parahippocampal gyrus during spatial and temporal
order memory tasks. Our results support theories consistent with
involvement of the prefrontal cortex in temporal order retrieval, the
medial temporal lobe in spatial and temporal memory tasks, and the
ventral and dorsal pathways in recall of object and spatial memory,
respectively. Further research should be able to distinguish previously
unknown subcomponents of this extended network of brain areas by
their differential activation across the three components of episodic
memory (what, where, and when).

G93
BRAIN ACTIVATION ASSOCIATED WITH ITEM AND SOURCE MEMORY
STRENGTH Brion Woroch1, Brian Gonsalves1; 1University of Illinois, UrbanaChampaign — Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) studies of
memory have shown dissociable patterns of activation for item recogni188

tion and source memory within the medial temporal lobes (MTL). Item
recognition is associated with activity in the perirhinal cortex, while
source memory is associated with activity in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. However, many studies confound differences
between item and source memory with differences in the overall
strength of memory. The current study addresses two main questions: 1)
To what extent does incomplete or partial source information contaminate brain activity attributed to item recognition? 2) Is activation of the
hippocampus associated with source memory specifically or strong
memory more generally? Participants encoded common visual objects in
one of two different task contexts by performing either a like/dislike or
natural/manmade judgment about the object. On a subsequent memory
test inside the scanner, participants made an old/new decision on a 4point confidence scale followed by a source memory confidence judgment, in which they indicated their confidence about which task they
had performed with the object at encoding. fMRI activity from the memory test was examined for activity that varied with item confidence while
holding source confidence constant, and vice versa. Preliminary data
shows that item and source memory strength are associated with dissociable patterns of brain activity both within and beyond the MTL, indicating that the type of memory (item vs. source), rather than memory
strength per se, determine which brain regions are involved in recognition memory.

G94
THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF FLUENCY ATTRIBUTION IN RECOGNITION
MEMORY Brian Kurilla1, Brian Gonsalves1; 1University of Illinois, UrbanaChampaign — The current experiment was designed to identify the electrophysiological correlates of the attributional processes thought to
underlie fluency effects in recognition memory. Participants studied a
list of words. Half studied the words visually and half studied them
aurally. Both groups received the same visual recognition memory test,
during which ERPs were recorded. During the test, fluency was
enhanced for half the items by means of perceptual priming. Preliminary
results suggest that, although priming had a similar effect on ERPs in
both groups, primed test items that were claimed to be “unstudied”
exhibited a late frontal positivity (~ 800 ms) compared to primed test
items that were claimed to be “studied.” This finding parallels the results
from an earlier study that used a more conceptually-based manipulation
of fluency (Wolk et al., 2004), and it suggests that fluency attribution
(either to prior study or some other source) is associated with activity at
frontal recording sites. In addition to this, early differences (300 – 500
ms) between the waveforms associated with hits and correct rejections
were larger following visual study than following auditory study, even
though behavioral measures of accuracy (d‘) showed superior discrimination following auditory study. This apparent dissociation suggests
that early ERP differences (e.g., FN 400effect) might reflect factors in
addition to memory strength, such as expectations regarding fluency. On
a visual test, people might anticipate a higher level of overall fluency following visual study, and this might occasionally lead to a failure to
notice fluency due to actual repetition.

HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SELF-CONTROL! STRATEGIC STUDY BEHAVIORS
THAT ENHANCE MEMORY Joel Voss1, David Warren2, Brian Gonsalves1,

Kara Federmeier1, Daniel Tranel2, Neal Cohen1; 1University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign, 2University of Iowa — Exploration is characterized as a strategic
process because animals continuously update their sensory sampling
behaviors in a manner that appears to optimize the efficacy of information gathering. Little information exists regarding the mechanisms for
this sort of behavioral control in humans. We therefore investigated the
neural substrates of a visual exploration strategy that occurred when
individuals studying an array of objects spontaneously looked “backwards” in their scanning paths to view recently seen objects again. This
spontaneous revisitation of recently viewed objects was a strong predictor of learning outcome, as individuals (N=40) displayed better later
recall and recognition performance for objects studied using this strategy

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Monday, April 4, 5:00 - 7:00 pm, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session G
relative to objects studied using other, more linear viewing patterns. In
an experiment on amnesic individuals with severe damage to the hippocampus (N=5), we found that viewing patterns rarely showed evidence for spontaneous revisitation. Furthermore, revisitation viewing
patterns did not increase memory performance in amnesic individuals.
These neuropsychological results provide a striking demonstration of
the necessity of the hippocampus in the short-term adaptive control of
behavior. fMRI data collected in healthy individuals without brain damage (N=14) confirmed the role of the hippocampus by showing that hippocampal activity correlated strongly with the expression of the
spontaneous revisitation viewing pattern, and further indicated that
fronto-cerebellar circuits interact with the hippocampus to produce the
memory benefits associated with this learning strategy. Our findings
thus demonstrate the role of these brain structures in the strategic control of information-seeking behaviors, and indicate that fronto-hippocampal interactions are involved in exploration.

UNITIZATION AND RECOGNITION MEMORY: ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL
EVIDENCE FOR BOTH BENEFITS AND COSTS Lea K Pilgrim1, Cindy M
Gray1, Jamie G Murray1, David I Donaldson1; 1University of Stirling — Dual

process accounts of episodic memory have lead to the identification of
familiarity and recollection as two independent bases for remembering.
The specific role of familiarity remains unclear however, particularly in
relation to memory for associations. Item and associative recognition
tasks have long provided a strong means of dissociating familiarity and
recollection. By this view, associative recognition of stimulus pairs is
supported solely by recollection, whereas item recognition of individual
stimuli is supported by both familiarity and recollection. Recent findings
suggest, however, that familiarity may also support associative recognition when to-be-remembered stimulus pairs are unitized into a single,
coherent representation (the so-called ‘benefit’ of unitization). What has
not yet been addressed is whether there is also a ‘cost’ of unitization to
recognition of individual items. In two studies we used Event-Related
Potentials (ERPs) to address whether there are ‘benefits’ of unitization to
associative recognition and also ’costs’ to item recognition. In one study
participants encoded word pairs under conditions that encouraged unitization and then performed both item and associative recognition tasks.
In the other study, participants encoded word pairs under two conditions (one that encouraged unitization and one that did not) and then
performed an item recognition test. We found that following unitization,
familiarity was able to support associative recognition. In contrast, following unitization, familiarity was unable to support item recognition.
These results reveal a measureable ‘benefit’ and ‘cost’ of unitization, suggesting that the representational nature of to-be-remembered stimuli is
critical in determining whether familiarity can contribute to episodic
memory.

ASSOCIATIVE STRENGTH, UNITIZATION AND THE BILATERAL FRONTAL
OLD/NEW EFFECT Daniele Ortu1, Kevin Allan2, David Donaldson1;
1University of Stirling, 2University of Aberdeen — Studies

of episodic retrieval
using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) consistently reveal the early (300500ms) bilateral frontal old/new effect, a putative correlate of familiarity
based remembering. Although typically elicited by item recognition,
previous research (Rhodes & Donaldson, 2007) has shown that the frontal effect can also be elicited by associative recognition - when a degree
of associative relationship exists between a pair of words (.206 associative strength in the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus). By contrast,
when no associative relationship exists, typically no frontal effect is
observed. This finding fits well with a ‘unitization’ account of familiarity; by this view associatively linked words are unitized, allowing a
familiarity signal to be generated for studied vs. unstudied word-pairs.
Here we tested this view by manipulating associative strength from
moderate to high levels (moderate = .068; high = .357), hypothesising
that increases in associative strength should further enhance the size of
the frontal effect. Recognition performance was equivalent across experi-

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

mental conditions, as was the magnitude of the late left parietal ERP correlate of recollection. Importantly, the moderate association condition
replicated prior findings; the frontal effect was evoked by correctly discriminated studied vs. unstudied pairs. By contrast however, and contrary to our hypothesis, a higher associative strength did not enhance the
frontal effect; it was in fact completely eliminated. This finding presents
a severe challenge for a unitization-based familiarity account of the early
frontal old/new effect, suggesting either a complex non-linear relationship between associative strength and familiarity, or that the ERP effect
simply does not reflect familiarity.

HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI REVEALS DISTINCT FORMS OF ASSOCIATIVE
NOVELTY ACTIVATION IN HIPPOCAMPUS Christine
Manthuruthil1,

Dagmar Zeithamova1, Alison R. Preston1; 1Center for Learning and Memory,
Department of Psychology, and Institute for Neuroscience, University of Texas
at Austin — Hippocampal activation is greater when encountering novel

relative to repeated events. Novelty, however, can take several forms—
e.g., discrimination of never-before-seen stimulus combinations (associative novelty per se) or stimulus configurations that violate existing memories (associative mismatch novelty)—to support distinct learning
processes. Previous research suggests that signals indicating associative
novelty per se predict binding of information within individual events,
whereas associative mismatch responses have been implicated in integrative encoding where information is bound across discrete episodes.
By comparing hippocampal activation across repetitions of non-overlapping object associations (XY) with those elicited by overlapping associations (AB, BC), we sought to isolate distinct forms of associative novelty
activation within hippocampus using high-resolution fMRI. We hypothesized that hippocampal activation would differ between non-overlapping and overlapping associations: non-overlapping pairs would
generate decreasing hippocampal activation across repetitions, reflecting
diminishing novelty of associations, while overlapping pairs would generate increasing hippocampal activation across repetitions, reflecting
enhanced associative mismatch detection as memories are established. In
line with these predictions, we observed two distinct novelty signatures
within hippocampus. Bilateral hippocampus, inclusive of all subfields,
showed decreased activation across repetition of non-overlapping associations, consistent with a signature of associative novelty per se. In contrast, a left hippocampal region, peak in subiculum, showed increased
activation across repetition of overlapping events relative to non-overlapping events, consistent with an associative mismatch response. These
results reveal distinct forms of associative novelty detection within the
hippocampus, and further suggest that a hippocampally-mediated associative mismatch response enables integration of related memories to
support flexible use of experience.

THE RIGHT HIPPOCAMPUS SUPPORTS THE PERCEPTUAL RICHNESS OF
COMPLEX EPISODIC MEMORIES: BEHAVIOURAL AND FUNCTIONAL MRI
EVIDENCE FROM UNILATERAL TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY Marie St-

Laurent1,2, Morris Moscovitch1,3, Mary Pat McAndrews1,2; 1University of
Toronto, Canada, 2Krembil Neuroscience Center and Toronto Western
Research Institute, Canada, 3Rotman Research Institute, Toronto, Canada —

Unilateral medial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) impairs the retrieval of
detailed autobiographical memories (AM) but it is unclear whether this
reflects a loss of content or a reduction in perceptual richness. Our goal
was to assess whether perceptual richness is one of the factors mediating
medial temporal lobe involvement during complex episodic memory
retrieval. Much of the existing evidence linking vivid recollection to
MTL function is correlational and here we designed a paradigm where
we manipulated richness while holding content stable. We presented
laboratory episodes as perceptually enriched film clips versus perceptually impoverished written narratives (with AM included as a comparator
condition). Healthy controls and patients with right mTLE were given
16s to retrieve an AM or a laboratory memory, and then described its

content and perceptual features in their own words. Controls retrieved a
greater number of perceptual details in the film condition than in the
narrative condition, but this difference was reduced for patients. Similarly, recall of perceptual details in AM was reduced in patients. In a parallel fMRI study, controls showed greater activation in the anterior right
hippocampus during retrieval for the AM and the film conditions in
comparison to the narrative condition, indicating a sensitivity to perceptual richness. In right mTLE patients, this task-related difference in activation was significantly reduced in comparison to controls, paralleling
the behavioural results. Together, our findings indicate that the right
medial temporal lobe is a key component of the neural circuitry supporting the integration of perceptual details into complex episodic memories.

THE ROLE OF THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBES IN CONSTRUCTING AN
IMAGINED EVENT Kristoffer Romero1, Morris Moscovitch1,2; 1University of

Toronto, 2Rotman Research Institute — Recent evidence suggests that brain

regions crucial for long-term memory (i.e., the medial temporal lobes)
are implicated in imagination in 2 ways: during the retrieval of task-relevant episodic information, and during the actual construction of imagined events. However, the exact manner by which the medial temporal
lobes (MTL) contribute to the process of event/scene construction is not
known. To investigate the role of the MTL in constructing imagined
events, patients with MTL lesions and matched controls were given a
context word and 3-6 item words on a screen, and asked to imagine a
new event with the words, being sure to explicitly relate the words as
often as possible. The number of explicit relations per trial was tallied as
a measure of relational coherence, and the likelihood of failing to include
all stimuli words was measured to determine forgetting. Compared to
matched controls, patients with MTL lesions consistently produced
fewer relations per trial and were more likely to fail to include all item
words, even though all stimuli were present for the duration of the trial.
These data suggest that the MTL are involved in constructing an imagined event, possibly by (re)encoding information into long-term memory
to be manipulated in working memory during the imagination process.

SYNCHRONIZED THETA OSCILLATIONS OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS DURING
ENCODING AND RETRIEVAL OF EPISODIC MEMORY IN HUMANS

Cornelia McCormick1,2, Mary Pat McAndrews1,2, Andrea B. Protzner2, Melanie
Cohn1,2, Taufik A. Valiante1,2; 1Krembil Neuroscience Center & Toronto
Western Research Institute, 2University of Toronto — It is well established
that the hippocampus is involved in encoding and retrieval of contextrich declarative memories. However, little is known about the temporal
coordination between the hippocampus and cortex during those mnemonic processes. Recent research suggests that hippocampal theta oscillations (4-8Hz) provide a temporal window for the coordination of this
network, however, it remains unclear whether and how hippocampal
signalling differs between encoding and retrieval processes. Here, we
studied 6 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with intracranial
EEG electrodes in hippocampus, entorhinal and lateral temporal cortex.
Recordings took place while patients performed encoding (30 new and
15x2 repeated) and retrieval (30 old and 30 new) of complex scenes. We
examined three different oscillatory parameters in the theta frequency
range: 1. Power, 2. Phase-locking and 3. Synchrony (i.e., phase-locking
over distant locations). During encoding, we found increased phaselocking and synchrony for scenes that were presented only once (new) in
comparison to repeated scenes. During retrieval, power, phase locking,
and synchrony parameters were increased for remembered (versus new)
scenes. These changes in theta parameters were specific to the hippocampus and interactions involving the hippocampus and cortex. These
results parallel our fMRI findings that both encoding and retrieval of
episodic information rely on a similar hippocampal-neocortical network.
Here we add that hippocampal theta oscillations provide the temporal
window for the transient link between these regions. This offers new
insight in the functional connectivity between hippocampus and cortex
that is directly related to neuronal processes.

INVOLVEMENT OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING IN EPISODIC MEMORY
PERFORMANCE IN YOUNGER AND OLDER ADULTS Badiaa Bouazzaoui1,

Lucie Angel1, Séverine Fay1, Laurence Taconnat1, Michel Isingrini1; 1University
of Tours, France — Neuropsychological models of memory agree that
medial temporal lobes are primarily involved in memory functioning
but numerous evidence link also episodic memory to the frontal lobes
which act as an executive function supervisor. Moreover, the executive
decline hypothesis of cognitive aging proposes that executive functioning is a major factor explaining age-related differences in episodic memory performance. Recent imaging data suggest that memory highperforming older adults exhibit significant activation of prefrontal cortex
not recruited by young adults. Given that the prefrontal cortex sustains
executive functioning, we may suggest that the use of executive functions to improve memory performance should be more important with
increasing age. Correlational and regression analyses were performed to
specify the link between episodic memory and executive performance in
young and older adults and to test the mediating role of executive functioning in age-related differences in episodic memory performance. Five
experiments were led in which we made vary memory tasks (free-recall,
cued-recall, recognition, logical memory) and executive tasks (inhibition,
switching and updating measures). Results showed that (1) memory and
executive performance were consistently positively correlated in older
adults while the correlations were globally not significant in younger
adults, (2) executive functioning had a strong mediating role in agerelated differences in memory performance. This finding seems parallel
the prefrontal overactivation observed in certain older adults and supports the view that memory performance is linked to executive functioning particularly in older adults, suggesting that this is a functioning of
brain aging that could be compensatory.

RECOLLECTION- AND FAMILIARITY-BASED FALSE MEMORIES IN
AMNESICS Jason D. Ozubko1, Andrew P. Yonelinas2; 1University of

Waterloo, 2University of California Davis — Recognition memory can be

based on two distinct processes: recollection and familiarity. Recollection
refers to one’s ability to mentally recreate an experience or episode,
whereas familiarity refers to an undifferentiated “feeling” that something has been experienced before. Past work has demonstrated that
amnesic patients with hippocampal damage are impaired at recollection
but exhibit relatively preserved familiarity. Interestingly, while amnesics’ recollective impairment often results in poorer memory, it also insulates amnesics against false memories (Verfaellie et al., 2005). In the
current study we examine the false memories of amnesics more closely,
by considering cases of recollective- and familiarity-based false memories. We predicted that, because amnesics show spared familiarity, they
would be vulnerable to familiarity-based false memories. In the first
experiment, subjects read sentences describing one of four events and
later used a 5-point remember-know scale to discriminate between studied and unstudied sentences describing those same events. As with past
work, we find that amnesics show impaired recollection but are insulated against false recollection. In the second experiment, subjects studied a list of words. At test, before each test trial, subjects were primed
with a context word—either the upcoming test word or a new word.
Again, subjects responded using a 5-point remember-know scale. When
context words matched the upcoming test word, fluency of the test word
was enhanced, resulting in more familiarity-based false alarms in both
amnesics and controls. We conclude that amnesia does insulate individuals against recollective-based false memories however, amnesics are
still susceptible to familiarity-based false memories.

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCE MONITORING IN CONFABULATION

Irene P. Kan1,2, Karen F. LaRocque2, Mieke Verfaellie2; 1Villanova University,

Memory Disorders Research Center, VA Boston, Boston University School of
Medicine — “Confabulation,” commonly observed in patients with ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm, refers to patients’ tendency to confuse true and untrue memories. This condition is sometimes
referred to as “honest lying” because individuals who confabulate tend
to believe in the distorted memories with conviction. Although the
nature of these memory distortions varies, one frequently observed characteristic is confabulators’ impairment in source monitoring. However,
relatively little is known about the specificity of this source monitoring
deficit. Here, we examined whether confabulators may be differentially
impaired at monitoring information from different sources. We compared monitoring of internally-generated information (imagined/perceived: Did I imagine or see a picture of an apple?) and monitoring of
externally-provided information (spatial location: Was the picture presented on the left or on the right?). Compared to non-confabulators (n =
8), confabulators (n = 10) are impaired at monitoring internally-generated information; however, the two groups performed similarly when
required to monitor externally-provided information.

DECODING RECENT AND REMOTE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES IN
THE HIPPOCAMPUS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI Heidi M. Bonnici1,

Martin J. Chadwick1, Demis Hassabis1, Antoine Lutti1, Nikolaus Weiskopf1,
Eleanor A. Maguire1; 1University College London, London, UK — The role of
the hippocampus in supporting remote autobiographical memories is
debated. One theory suggests that, once consolidated, autobiographical
memories are no longer represented in the hippocampus and instead
become neocortically-dependent (consolidation theory). Other theories,
e.g. the multiple trace theory, the scene construction theory, posit that
autobiographical memories have a permanent representation within the
hippocampus, no matter how remote the memories. In this study we set
out to examine the neural representations of recent and remote autobiographical memories using high-resolution fMRI and multivariate pattern
analysis (MVPA). One week before scanning participants (n=12) were
asked to recall memories from the recent (two weeks ago) and remote
(ten years ago) past. Three memories of each type were chosen, matched
for ease of recall, vividness, level of detail, and valence. During scanning
participants recalled the six memories numerous times, in a random
order. Medial temporal (hippocampus, entorhinal, perirhinal, posterior
parahippocampal cortices) and temporal neocortical (temporal pole,
middle temporal gyrus) regions were defined for each participant, and
the voxel patterns from each area were used in multivariate pattern classification analyses. The classifier operating on the hippocampal voxels
displayed successful decoding of both recent and remote autobiographical memories significantly above chance. This result shows that the hippocampus contains representations of remote memories, as well as
recent memories, in line with the multiple trace and scene construction
accounts.

DIFFERENTIAL INVOLVEMENT OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS IN ASSOCIATIVE
MEMORY: BETWEEN-DOMAIN ASSOCIATION AND TASK-DIFFICULTY
Juyoun Jung1, Soo-Jung Min1, Sanghoon Han1, Do-Joon Yi1; 1Yonsei University,
Seoul, Korea — Although the medial temporal lobe, including the hippoc-

ampus, is generally agreed to play a crucial role in associative memory,
unique contribution of its sub-structure remains a subject of debate, perhaps because typical paradigms do not divorce the domain specificity
and retrieval effort during associative memory. We used event-related
functional magnetic resonance imaging (efMRI) to examine hippocampal activation during associative memory retrieval in which the type of
material that has to be associated was manipulated across domains
(Piekema et al., 2009). During the encoding phase, participants learned to
associate three types of pairs; face-house, house-house, and face-face.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

During the retrieval phase, participants performed a pair-recognition
test with intact (old) pairs intermixed with rearranged (lure) pairs. The
memory accuracy of both face-house and house-house conditions was
similarly superior to face-face condition. Despite the accuracy difference
among stimulus types, anterior hippocampus activation for betweendomain pairs (face-house) exceeded that of within-domain pairs (faceface and house-house). However, the contrast between two retrieval conditions of within-domain pairs yielded significant activation in relatively
posterior hippocampal/parahippocampal regions for face-face retrieval,
demonstrating that the regions are activated as a function of greater
retrieval difficulty arising from the type of stimulus category, and not
reflective of a cross-domain association. Together, these findings indicate
that hippocampus is more involved in retrieving associative memory of
between-domain information and the sub-regions of hippocampus
might be functionally differentiated according to the task difficulty and
the process of associative memory.

EPISODIC CONSTRUCTION VERSUS ELABORATION: EVIDENCE FROM
DEVELOPMENTAL AMNESIA Donna Kwan1, Nicole Carson1, Donna Rose

Addis2, R. Shayna Rosenbaum1,3; 1York University, Toronto, Canada, 2The
University of Auckland, New Zealand, 3Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest,
Toronto, Canada — Recent investigations of two developmental amnesic
individuals have generated inconclusive results regarding whether such
individuals have preserved episodic future imagining, unlike their
adult-onset counterparts (cf. Kwan et al., 2010; Maguire et al., 2010). A
possible reason for this discrepancy may be differences in the experimental tasks used: both studies required elaboration of the imagined
events but the one in which the patient was found to be impaired also
required event construction (Kwan et al., 2010). To investigate whether
removing constructive demands could account for the deficit observed,
we tested the same developmental amnesic individual, H.C., on a task of
episodic future imagining that required only elaboration of a given
event. In contrast to her previous performance, HC’s future imagining
was found to be intact when the task had no constructive demand and
required only event elaboration. Results highlight that episodic thought
consists of both event construction and elaboration, two processes that
may be dissociable in hippocampal amnesia.

THE INFLUENCE OF LIST POSITION AND EARLY-ONSET HIPPOCAMPAL
DAMAGE ON THE LAG EFFECT Janet L. Roberts1, Nicholas J. Cepeda1, R.

Shayna Rosenbaum1,2; 1York University, Toronto, Canada, 2Rotman Research
Institute, Baycrest, Toronto, Canada — The lag effect refers to the phenomenon whereby recall of repeated items increases as a function of inter-repetition interval. However, few studies include the average list position
for each lag condition, and it is unclear whether the lag effect persists following hippocampal damage. The goal of Experiment 1 was to determine if controlling for list position would eliminate the typical lag effect,
as lists used in previous studies have not been matched in terms of list
position, possibly leading to an artificially enhanced lag effect. To this
end, we presented 10 lists of words with lags of 0, 1, 6 and 24 intervening
items, with each list followed by a period of free recall. Average list position was controlled for in half of the lists and was left uncontrolled in the
remaining lists, but yielded no signficant differences. In Experiment 2,
we investigated whether a developmental hippocampal amnesic, H.C.,
would exhibit a normal lag effect with a task identical to the controlled
condition of Experiment 1. Adult-onset amnesic individuals have been
shown to benefit from spacing between repetitions (Cermack et al.,
1996), but this has yet to be demonstrated in developmental amnesic
individuals who had never experienced intact episodic memory and
with longer lags. H.C., a young woman with early-onset hippocampal
damage, did show a lag effect despite overall lower recall. Together,
these experiments support the findings in existing lag effect literature,
and extend our knowledge of developmental hippocampal amnesic individuals.

SPATIAL MEMORY FOR HIGHLY EXPERIENCED ENVIRONMENTS IN A
CASE OF DEVELOPMENTAL AMNESIA Benjamin Cassidy1, Donna Kwan1,

Janet Roberts1, Shayna Rosenbaum1,2; 1York University, 2Rotman Research
Institute — The hippocampus has been implicated in general spatial memory with a particular role in allocentric representations of space. These
representations are thought to rely most on the hippocampus during initial acquisition while becoming increasingly reliant on neocortical areas
of the brain over time. Support for this belief comes from adult and animal hippocampal lesion studies that show impaired learning of new spatial environments, but preserved memory of those acquired
premorbidly. However, it is unclear if spatial memories can be acquired
in an individual who has sustained hippocampal lesions in early development. This study investigates memory of familiar spatial environments in a young adult, HC, who acquired bilateral hippocampal lesions
in infancy. HC’s spatial memory of her local neighbourhood was tested
using 10 standard mental navigation tasks. Her performance was compared to that of healthy controls (n=5) from the same residential area.
HC was significantly impaired on some, but not all, tasks reliant on allocentric representations of space, as well as some requiring an egocentric
framework. These results suggest HC has acquired at least some spatial
representations of a familiar environment in the absence of normally
functioning hippocampi, which may be the result of alternative compensatory strategies acquired by HC during early development.

FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF AGE-RELATED HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRY
REDUCTION AND OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING IN MEMORY AND: AN ERP
APPROACH Michel Isingrini1, Lucie Angel1, Badiaa Bouazzaoui1, Laurence

experiment
Taconnat1, Severine Fay1; 1University of Tours, France — This
explored the functional significance of age-related hemispheric asymmetry reduction associated with episodic memory and the cognitive mechanisms that mediate this brain pattern. Parietal old/new effect-eventrelated potentials were recorded while younger and older adults performed a word stem cued-recall task. We also investigated age differences in lateralization by computing a lateralization index of the parietal
old/new effect for each individual, based on left and right hemisphere
activation differences. Results confirmed that the parietal old/new effect
was of larger latency, of reduced magnitude and less lateralized in the
older group than the young group. Correlation analyses indicated that
only in the older group memory performance and executive level were
reliably related to the lateralization index. The older participants who
presented a high level of memory performance and of executive functioning were those with the higher level of hemispheric asymmetry
reduction. Moreover, in this group, regression analyses indicated that
the degree of laterality of brain activity mediates age-related differences
in memory performance. Results of regression analyses are also compatible with a cascade model in which the individual’s level of executive
functioning mediates age-related differences in the degree of lateralization of brain activity, which, in turn, mediates age-related differences in
memory performance. Overall, our findings support the view that agerelated hemispheric asymmetry reduction is beneficial in old age, suggesting compensation mechanisms. They also strongly suggest that cognitive abilities may determine brain reorganization during aging.

NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL REPETITION EFFECTS ON MARKERS OF OBJECT
KNOWLEDGE ACTIVATION WITH PERCEPTUALLY SIMILAR CATEGORY
EXEMPLARS Stephen Maher1, Phillip Holcomb1; 1Tufts University — People are quickly able to categorize objects they have never seen before if
the object is from a known category. Previous work has posited that
more abstract representations of objects in a left-lateralized visual subsystem, which may also represent semantic aspects of object knowledge,
might allow for this ability. The frontopolar N3 is an event-related
potential (ERP) and putative correlate of object categorization that indicates object representations are view - but not contour - specific, and
active between 200 and 400 ms. While the N3 shows attenuation with
repetition of identical objects or objects with global shape preserved, no
repetition effects on the N3 have been found for repeated category exemplars. For the current experiment, people categorized objects during an
indirect memory test in a 2 repetition (new, old different category exemplar) x 2 naming (same or different subordinate name from study to test)
design. Results showed highly left-lateralized repetition effects (perceptually similar exemplars were attenuated compared to new items) on the
N3 from 200-400 ms. Repetition and naming did not interact, inconsistent with semantic representation activation in visual processes indexed
here. Control analyses for explicit memory confounds indicated that N3
effects were not due to subject perception that exemplars were simply
identical items. These data indicate that categorization of novel objects
from known categories may be achieved by abstract visual form representations, possibly in a lateralized abstract subsystem, which generalize
across some changes in global form. Semantic representation in this system, however, is not supported by this work.

SLOW WAVE SLEEP PLAYS A ROLE IN THE TRANSFER OF STATISTICAL
INFORMATION FROM THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE TO THE STRIATUM
DURING CONSOLIDATION Simon Durrant1, Scott Cairney1, Penelope

Lewis1; 1School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK. —

Memory consolidation during sleep has been increasingly documented
in the last decade. Perceptual learning, and in particular the important
field of exposure learning, is currently under-represented in this
research. Here we studied the impact of sleep upon abstraction of statistical patterns from exposure learning. 36 participants divided equally
between Sleep and Wake groups took part in a statistical learning task
which involved exposure to a structured auditory stream followed by an
immediate-recall session, and after a consolidation gap a delayed-recall
session, in both of which they were required to identify short sequences
with a structure similar to the exposure stream. The Sleep group were
trained and immediately tested at 3pm on Day 1. Their overnight sleep
was then monitored with polysomnography, and they were retested in
the fMRI scanner at 3pm on Day 2. Participants in the Wake Group were
trained and immediately tested at 3pm and then placed immediately in

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

an fMRI scanner for the second test session, with no consolidation delay.
Behaviourally, identification of structured sequences improved more in
the Sleep than the Wake group, and this improvement correlated with
the amount of slow wave sleep obtained. Functionally, we found a
decreased dependence on the hippocampus and increased activation of
the striatum after sleep during correct identification of structured
sequences. Importantly, this functional shift correlated with the amount
of slow wave sleep obtained. Our findings broadly support the standard
model of consolidation and highlight the importance of slow wave sleep
in this process.

EXTINCTION AND SPONTANEOUS RECOVERY OF CONTEXTUAL FEAR
MEMORIES Evelyn Glotzbach1, Heike Ewald1, Christian Tröger1, Andreas

Mühlberger1, Paul Pauli1; 1University of Würzburg — During extinction a fear

eliciting stimulus is experienced without aversive consequences and fear
responses decrease. Nevertheless, previous studies on cue conditioning
revealed spontaneous recovery effects, meaning that extinguished fear
responses can return after a passage of time, because the fear memory is
not erased but inhibited. Besides cue conditioning contextual conditioning, where an aversive event is not linked to a specific stimulus but to a
complex context, can be used to study sustained anxiety. Until now it is
unsettled which effect extinction has on contextual fear memories. To
study contextual conditioning in humans we created two immersive virtual environments (office rooms). On day one participants received electric stimuli (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one context (CXT+) but
never in a second context (CXT-). On day two participants underwent
extinction in both contexts. To test spontaneous recovery, participants
were again exposed to the two contexts on day three. Startle response,
skin conductance level (SCL) and ratings for valence were recorded. We
found startle potentiation and heightened SCL in CXT+ on day one and
during the first extinction block on day two. Physiological fear reactions
were extinguished at the end of day two and did not return on day three.
Contrary, valence ratings for CXT+ compared to CXT- remained more
negative on all three days. In sum, after extinction of context conditioning we found sustained effects for subjective responses, but no hints for
spontaneous recovery. In humans, spontaneous recovery may be specific
for cue conditioning and cannot be easily verified in context conditioning.

to survive, organisms avoid pain, approach rewards and learn how to
predict these biologically salient events. Interestingly, organisms
respond with avoidance-like behaviors to a stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) preceding a painful event (unconditioned stimulus, US), but
with reward-like behaviors to CS following the painful US. Here, we further investigated the role of the event timing in associative learning.
During a differential conditioning paradigm, a geometric shape (CS+)

193

Poster Session H — Tuesday, April 5, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse
was either presented before (forward conditioning) or after (backward
conditioning) a painful electric shock (US). Moreover, the timing
between CS-onset and US-onset (interstimulus interval, ISI) varied
among groups. Two groups of participants underwent forward conditioning with ISI lasting either 8 s or 14 s and two groups underwent
backward conditioning with ISI lasting -6 s or 0 s. Startle amplitude and
explicit ratings were measured as dependent variable. No conditioned
startle responses were found after forward conditioning with 14 s ISI.
Startle amplitude was potentiated after both forward conditioning with
8 s ISI and backward conditioning with 0 s ISI. To the contrary, startle
response was attenuated after backward conditioning with -6 s ISI.
Importantly, participants rated the CS as “emotionally” aversive independently from event timing. In summary, the temporal proximity to a
biologically salient event may crucially determine the affective properties of such a conditioned stimulus. Noteworthy, the dissociation
between the implicit (startle response) and the explicit (subjective ratings) responses after backward conditioning suggests that event timing
might explain dissociations found in psychiatric disorders like drug
addiction or anxiety.

THE ROLE OF THE PERIRHINAL CORTEX IN FEATURE AMBIGUITY AND
CONTEXT Jonathan P. Shine1, Carina S. Hibbs1, Kim S. Graham1; 1Wales
Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, School of Psychology, Cardiff University,
UK — Recent research suggests that perirhinal cortex is necessary for processing objects with a high degree of feature ambiguity (Graham et al.,
2010; Saksida et al., 2010). We asked, therefore, whether manipulating
object feature ambiguity using an oddity task would modulate activity
in perirhinal cortex (high>low). Complementary to this, we tested
whether activity in this region would be modulated by context (e.g., a
strong association with a particular location), a factor thought to influence activity in the parahippocampal place area (PPA, Bar et al., 2003).
Healthy volunteers were scanned whilst performing a task in which they
had to select the different item from three concurrently presented stimuli. Scene and object stimuli were presented. Half the object trials were
considered high context (e.g., hard hat), and the other half low context
(e.g., bowl). Left perirhinal cortex showed a main effect of stimuli
(object>scenes), with greater activation for object trials that were high in
feature ambiguity and high in context (relative to all other conditions). In
the PPA, greater activation was associated with high versus low context
object oddity trials but processing of both virtual reality and real world
scene oddity was associated with significantly greater activity than all
object oddity conditions. These data suggest that perirhinal cortex does
not simply process feature ambiguity but also processes the context with
which an item is associated. Although PPA showed a significant effect of
context, the biggest response was clearly for scenes over all object oddity
decisions, implying that this region primarily processes scene stimuli.

COMBINING FMRI AND EYE-TRACKING TO UNDERSTAND CONTEXTUAL
CUEING IN VISUAL SEARCH Anna Manelis1, Lynne M. Reder1; 1CMU —
Contextual cueing is characterized by facilitation of visual search when a
target appears within learned spatial configurations. We recorded eye
movements while subjects performed an abbreviated contextual cueing
task in a scanner. Both response time and number of eye fixations to
locate the target in a display decreased with practice but this decrease
was greater for repeated than novel displays. While improvement for
novel displays may reflect procedural learning, improvement for
repeated displays may reflect a mixture of both task learning and learning of the contextual cues. If contributions from procedural learning and
contextual cueing are independent, the patterns of neural activity in the
procedural learning regions should not depend on whether spatial configurations are novel or repeated. The analysis of repeated configurations revealed a strong correlation between repetition-related changes in
BOLD signal and the number of fixations in rHPC, rITG, bilateral frontal
and parietal regions. The same analysis of novel displays revealed a
strong correlation between these measures in right superior parietal lob-

194

ule, bilateral occipital fusiform and prefrontal regions, a network distinct
from that for repeated displays. Given that the pattern of neural
response for novel displays were not replicated for repeated displays,
there is little support for the position that procedural learning and contextual cuing are independent. The strong correlation for repeated trials
between increases in hippocampal activation and decreases in the number of fixations leads us to believe that the contextual cueing effect
results from successful binding of a specific target location to its
repeated spatial context

SHIFTING SPATIAL LEARNING STRATEGIES: PLACE AND RESPONSE
L.
MECHANISMS FOR DIFFERENT NAVIGATIONAL PRIORITIES Amy

Shelton1, Steven A. Marchette1, Andrew J. Furman1, Arnold Bakker1, Scott R.
Clark1, Joshua Lachewitz1; 1Johns Hopkins University — Studies of rat spatial

learning and memory have suggested that two parallel learning mechanisms contribute to navigation: place learning and response learning.
Generally, place learning is a flexible system relying on the hippocampus for learning the locations of objects relative to cues in the environment, whereas response learning is a rigid system relying on the
striatum for learning a fixed sequence of responses that lead to a goal.
Both systems support successful navigation, under most circumstances,
but they likely represent solutions that optimize different goals and priorities. In a series of experiments we used a Dual Solution paradigm,
inspired by tasks used in the rat, to investigate the role of place and
response mechanisms in human navigation. In this paradigm, participants learned a virtual environment via passive navigation on the same
route over many repetitions. At test, participants were subjected to different conditions that reveal their dependence on environmental cues vs.
familiar routes. In Exp. 1, we observed individual differences in the preferential use of novel shortcuts versus familiar routes. These differences
corresponded to brain activation differences in the hippocampus and
striatum, as predicted by a distinction between place and response learning (Exp. 2). In Exp. 3 and 4, we explored the hypothesis that different
strategies are optimal for different situations by investigating how varying the experimental conditions shifted people from one strategy to
another. Taken together, our results suggest that humans, like rats, are
able to opportunistically engage different spatial learning systems to
achieve complex navigational goals.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF SOURCE MEMORY ENCODING IN YOUNG
ADULTS Julia Mattson1, Michael Rugg1; 1Center for the Neurobiology of
Learning and Memory, University of California-Irvine — fMRI investigations
of successful source memory encoding are often confounded with the
strength of item memory. Here, we used a memory test that incorporated separate five-point item and source confidence ratings in order to
investigate the neural correlates of the encoding of source information
while holding item memory strength constant. fMRI data were acquired
while subjects were cued to make size or indoor/outdoor judgments, on
a series of pictures denoting everyday objects. During a later unscanned
test phase, studied (old) and unstudied (new) pictures were presented
under the requirement to make sequential old/new and source (size? vs.
where?) judgments, rating the confidence of each judgment on a 5-point
scale. ‘Source subsequent memory effects’ were defined as greater activity for correctly and confidently identified study items that attracted confident correct as opposed to inaccurate source judgments. By restricting
the subsequent memory contrast to confidently recognized old items we
ensured that subsequent memory effects reflecting successful source

memory. The right posterior hippocampus demonstrated a subsequent
memory effect that was uniquely associated with successful source
memory. This region was anatomically distinct from extra-hippocampal
regions of the medial temporal lobe that predicted item memory. The
findings suggest that the hippocampus is differentially engaged during
successful vs. unsuccessful contextual encoding, even when item memory strength is controlled. This is consistent with the proposal that the

This event-related potential (ERP) experiment explores neural and
behavioral priming effects as a function of type of repetition: identical or
different exemplar. We investigated priming as a function of whether
items are subsequently recognized at test. During the encoding phase,
subjects judged photographs of common objects as “natural” or “manmade.” Half of the repeated items were presented again with the same
photograph and half with a different exemplar of the same item. Additional trials were items shown only once during the encoding phase.
Subjects then viewed a series of words during a surprise recognition
phase. They judged whether they had seen one or two pictures that corresponded to the word, or none at all. If they thought they had seen two
pictures, they indicated whether they previously viewed identical or different repetitions. Accuracy on the latter judgment was an index of recollection-based responding. Response time (RT) and ERP data were
collected during the encoding and test phases. Response time analyses
support the conclusion that there is facilitation for both identical and different exemplar repetitions beyond simple practice at the task. Patterns
of RTs based on subsequent memory accuracy show a more complex
pattern. Exploring the ERP components during encoding, we found a
difference in P300 amplitude as a function of the different types of repetitions. ERP components corresponding to recollection vs. familiarity
also indicated a differential effect of repetition type on subsequent memory. The findings have implications for the study of priming as a familiarity-based memory process.

American University — Priming is described as an improvement in speed,
bias, or accuracy when processing a stimulus, following unconscious
prior exposure to the same stimulus. Recent studies have investigated
the role of stimulus-response (S-R) learning during repetition priming
tasks. By using task switches between the study and test sessions, these
studies claim to avoid binding between a specific motor-action, a decision, and a task-specific classification with a stimulus during repetitive
exposures. These studies have found that most priming results are
explainable solely as S-R bindings. A possible confound is the higher
executive function demands from processing the stimuli at several different levels, i.e. switching target finger responses creates interference as
participants must repeatedly modify their decision criteria. We
addressed the issue with a counterbalanced four-category classification
task using natural visual stimuli (animal species), and a long-lag priming
design administered to 27 healthy participants. We assumed that task
difficulty would hinder automatization of the subjects’ response pattern,
thus avoiding S-R bindings. Our results indicate a strong significant
priming effect, though surprisingly, only for one of the four animal categories. In theory, the stimuli used to prime should be interchangeable,
showing no difference in effectiveness. However, our results argue differently. Though it remains unclear why only rodents produced priming, what has become evident by removing the S-R effect is that the
stimuli used in priming studies is far from irrelevant. These results are
discussed in terms of the possible stronger involvement of a priori prototypes, and other issues related to the S-R learning paradigm.

Cognitive Interaction Technologies for Medicine, Bielefeld University — Neuroscientific investigations of priming have controversially discussed the
effects of color-information on identification performance. In the present
work, we investigated the influence of color on the identification of natural images in the context of perceptual priming. For this purpose, thirtythree healthy participants were tested across different conditions using a
unifactorial between-subjects design. Our study consisted of a learning
phase with an interference-task, a neuropsychological test-battery and a
retrieval phase with a picture-fragment completion test. The learning
phase was composed of three groups of participants whereby the stimuli
were presented in different formats to the first two groups, i.e. colored
vs. gray-staged. The third group did not participate in the learning phase
(control group). During the retrieval phase the fragmenting step by
which a stimulus was correctly recognized was measured (i.e. the recognition stage). Lower recognition stages indicated better identification
performance. The results clearly demonstrate that previously seen colored stimuli increased the subsequent identification performance of colored and even gray-staged stimuli. In contrast, prior viewed gray-staged
stimuli caused poorer identification performance. Particularly, prior
seen colored compared to gray-staged stimuli provoked much better
identification performance of the same subsequently presented stimuli
in their gray-staged format. We concluded that color significantly raises
effects of perceptual priming, even if targets are not colored but graystaged during retrieval. Importantly, these findings suggest the existence
of lucid color-effects on perceptual priming within the frame of early
learning processes.

ATTENTIONAL TOP-DOWN MODULATION OF UNCONSCIOUS SEMANTIC
PRIMING BY TASK SETS Sarah Adams1, Markus Kiefer1; 1University of
Ulm, Department of Psychiatry, Ulm, Germany — The automaticity of semantic processing is controversially debated. While some argue that semantic processing depends on strategic retrieval, evidence from masked
semantic priming studies indicates that access to semantics can also
occur automatically. This contradiction can be accommodated by the
attentional sensitization model proposed previously (Kiefer & Martens,
2010) which suggests that semantic processing is initiated without deliberate intention. However, automatic semantic processing is modulated
by attentional task sets which differentially sensitize semantic pathways
by prefrontal top-down signals. In ERP studies we used a modified
masked semantic priming paradigm to investigate which attentional
task sets enhance or attenuate unconscious semantic word processing.
Participants were first engaged in semantic and phonological induction
tasks that should either activate a semantic or phonological task set. Subsequent to the response in the induction task, a masked prime word,
either associated or non-associated to the following lexical decision target word, was presented. Across experiments, we varied the nature of
the phonological induction task (phonological word/ letter categorization) to test the boundary conditions for unconscious semantic processing to occur. Results showed a differential modulation of masked
semantic priming effects by the induced task sets: attention towards
reading the entire word in the semantic and word phonology induction
tasks facilitated unconscious priming. Contrarily, the letter phonological
task attenuated priming. This indicates that unconscious semantic processing depends on an attentional task set that involves lexical but not
necessarily semantic processing. The present results therefore further
specify how attentional top-down control modulates unconscious
semantic processing.

CAN HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION ALTER THE AUTOMATICITY OF SEMANTIC
PRIMING? Klaus Hoenig1, Martin Ulrich1, Walter Bongartz2, Georg Grön1,
Markus Kiefer1; 1University of Ulm, Germany, 2Klingenberg Institute for Clinical
Hypnosis, Konstanz, Germany — Semantic priming is held to ensue from

automatic spreading activation within an associatively organized memory network. Such automaticity is considered to occur autonomously,
independent of top-down control, and to be not easily interrupted. However, recent findings suggest that even automatic (unconscious) processes might be susceptible to top-down control. Whether cognitive
control can be exerted over automatic processes is of both theoretical and
clinical importance. Hypnotic suggestion is one practice for which the
potential for such top-down control of automatic processes has been
claimed. To date, it is unclear whether hypnotic suggestion can modulate automatic semantic priming, and if so, at what level of processing.
We investigated this potential of hypnotic suggestion using eventrelated
fMRI in a semantic priming study. Within the context of a lexical decision task, pairs of words were presented that were either semantically
relate or unrelated. Subjects with high (HHS) and low hypnotic susceptibility (LHS) performed the semantic priming task in two scanning sessions (with and without hypnotic suggestion). Both groups evidenced
equal amounts of semantic priming in normal wakefulness (i.e. without
hypnotic suggestion). With hypnotic suggestion in trance, semantic
priming was substantially reduced in subjects with HHS. FMRI analysis
revealed preliminary evidence for a modulation of priming-associated
brain activity by hypnotic suggestion in left middle temporal, fusiform,
and inferior frontal gyri. These findings demonstrate that within HHS
subjects semantic priming is susceptible to top-down control by hypnotic suggestion. Hypnotic suggestion appears to exert its influence
directly on brain regions commonly associated with automatic semantic
activation.

IMPLICIT RECOGNITION BASED ON LATERALIZED PERCEPTUAL
FLUENCY Iliana M. Vargas1, Joel L. Voss2, Ken A. Paller1; 1Northwestern

University, 2Beckman Institute — In some circumstances, accurate recognition of repeated kaleidoscope images is driven by implicit-memory processes. For instance, when we tested recognition with two-alternative
forced-choice procedures with perceptually similar foils, guesses were
more accurate than confident responses and neural correlates of correct
guessing resembled perceptual-priming correlates. Moreover, images
learned under divided attention were recognized more accurately than
those learned under full attention. We proposed that "implicit recognition" results from perceptual fluency that influences responding without
awareness of memory retrieval. This fluency may arise from plasticity in
visual cortex regions responsible for object perception. Here we examined whether recognition would vary if images appeared in the same or
different visual field during learning and testing. Kaleidoscope images
were briefly presented left or right of fixation during divided-attention
encoding. Presentation on the same side at test produced higher recognition accuracy than presentation on the other side. Additionally, accuracy
was higher for confident responses than for guesses, a pattern typical for
explicit memory—but this pattern was present only for different-side trials. For same-side trials, accuracy was higher for guesses than for confident responses. Guessing accuracy for same-side trials reached 77%
correct, comparable to that in our prior studies and presumably reflecting an implicit influence of fluency signals. The dramatic difference in
guessing accuracy as a function of whether the initially stimulated visual
field was the same at study and test suggests that implicit recognition
arises from memory storage in specific networks in the visual cortex yetto-be identified, but likely mediating repetition-induced fluency increments.

HOW DOES THE TIMING OF SEMANTIC PROCESSING EVOLVE OVER THE
COURSE OF MULTIPLE REPETITIONS? AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATION Louis Renoult1,3, Xiaoxiao Wang2, J. Bruno Debruille2,3;

Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2McGill University,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 3Douglas Mental Health University Institute,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada — The N400 event-related potential (ERP) has

consistently been associated with semantic processing. Recent studies
have reported that its peak latency was much earlier for highly repeated
words than non-repeated words (Debruille & Renoult, 2009; Renoult &
Debruille, in press). There was however no difference in onset latency,
suggesting that these N400s were rather characterized by a shorter duration than an earlier occurrence. It might be concluded from these studies
that the use of high rates of repetition results in a shortening of semantic
processing. However, only two target words were used in these experiments. This small number could also have influenced the duration of
semantic processing. The present study aimed to test this possibility. 28
subjects participated in 3 semantic categorization tasks, which differed
only in the number of target words used (4, 12 and 24). Each word was
repeated 15 times. The results showed that the number of target words
did not influence N400 amplitude or latency. In the condition where 24
different target words were used, the number of trials was sufficient to
compare individual levels of repetition (24 words x 28 participants).This
analysis revealed that N400 peak latency decreased after a few presentations: from 390ms post-onset for the first presentation to a plateau of
about 350ms at the fifth presentation. These results suggest that repetition itself rather than the number of target words used can shorten the
duration of semantic processing and that a minimal duration is reached
after a few presentations.

THE ANATOMY OF SEMANTIC FEATURES IN OBJECT RECOGNITION

Jovichic1, Maria Luisa Gorno-Tempini1,2; 1Center for Mind/Brain Sciences,
University of Trento, Italy, 2Memory and Aging Center, Department of
Neurology, University of California, San Francisco — The processing of different object categories leads to the activation of partly segregated brain
areas, depending on the nature of their most salient features (e.g. sensory, motor, encyclopedic). In order to investigate this segregation of
object features further, we used fMRI and a paradigm with two different
tasks requiring the processing of different features: subjects had either to
decide whether two objects are typically found at the same place, or
whether they typically move in the same way. Three different object categories were presented: animals, manipulable and non-manipulable
objects. Thirteen right-handed subjects took place in the study and were
scanned on a 4 Tesla scanner, using parameters optimized for the temporal poles. Contrasting the “place” versus the “movement” task, the precuneus, angular gyrus, anterior middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus,
and superior medial frontal gyrus were active in the left hemisphere.
Instead, by contrasting the “movement” to the “place” task, we found
bilateral activations in the posterior inferior temporal gyri, supramarginal gyri, superior parietal lobes, and the posterior inferior frontal gyri
(IFG). Our results suggest that the “place” feature is processed mainly in
left hemisphere areas, reported by a variety of previous studies to be
involved in semantic processing. By contrast, the “movement” feature
seems to rely more on areas in the dorsal stream, bilaterally. These findings are in correspondence with previously reported results, demonstrating that object categories with a salient movement feature, like tools,
activate those areas even in a task being neutral with respect to movement.

USING EEG AND EMG TO TEST THE RETRIEVAL EFFORT HYPOTHESIS OF
THE TESTING EFFECT Leonora Coppens1, Peter Verkoeijen1, Remy Rikers1;
1Erasmus University Rotterdam — Retrieval

effort is often considered to be
a factor in the emergence of the testing effect (i.e., tested information is
retained better than restudied information in the long term). Usually, the
measure of effort in testing effect paradigms is response latency. In the
present study, EEG and EMG were used to measure retrieval effort during learning more directly. Participants studied and were tested on word
pairs. During learning, event-related synchronization (ERS) of the theta
band and muscular activity in the corrugator supercilii area were used as
a measure of effort. Preliminary results show that testing evoked a
higher frontal theta ERS percentage and higher corrugator supercilii
activity than restudying. Moreover, tested items were more often
recalled correctly on the retention test after 2 days than restudied items.
Thus, items that were retrieved with more effort during learning were
recalled better on the final test. These results support the retrieval effort
hypothesis of the testing effect.

AN ERP INVESTIGATION OF SEMANTIC ELABORATION IN VISUAL
WORKING MEMORY Elizabeth Orme1, Leigh Riby1; 1Northumbria
University — Previous research has employed the Visual Patterns Test as
an index of visuo-spatial working memory task performance. However,
the specific cognitive mechanisms engaged during task performance
remain unclear. For instance, Brown et al (2006) reported that the availability of verbal coding (i.e. visual patterns resembling familiar shapes
versus abstract unfamiliar shapes) during the encoding of stimuli
impacts on the richness of the memory trace and subsequent successful
retrieval. Using the temporal precision of event related potential methodology (ERP; derived from the EEG), this study extends recent behavioural work in this area. Specifically, the study examines known ERP
components related to the encoding and retrieval of stimuli differing in
familiarity. At encoding, visual patterns which are rated as high in familiarity lead to a greater amplitude of the p3 component in parietal and
occipital regions along with an increase in amplitude of a frontally distributed N400 component and a prolonged negative slow wave. These
are taken as indeces of enhanced semantic encoding of patterns rated as
high in familiarity compared to patterns rated as low in familiarity. This
enhanced encoding is coupled with a superiority in memory for the
familiar patterns relative to the unfamiliar patterns. At retrieval a parietally distributed positive slow wave is observed for correct rejections of
new patterns that are low in familiarity. This is coupled with an increase
in amplitude of the p2 component. The retrieval results are discussed in
terms of the unfamiliar patterns placing a greater demand on working
memory.

recognized without engagement of certain actions. On the contrary, the
neural activity in the dorsal route (i.e., “how” pathway) for recognition
of actions manipulating with man-made objects would be specifically
influenced by the handedness because such actions are typically dominated by a certain hand. We tested these hypotheses with 21 righthanded and 22 left-handed subjects using a picture-word verification

task for two object categories(animals vs. tools) and for two categories of
actions(manipulating actions vs. non-manipulating actions) in two successive event-related fMRI experiments. Results of the experiment 1
showed categorically distinctive activation patterns in the ventral route
regardless of handedness of subjects; the more ventrolateral temporal
activation for animals and the more ventromedial temporal activation
for tools. Comparably, results of experiment 2 showed a striking group
difference. While right-handed subjects showed a strongly lateralized
activation to the left, the left-handed subjects showed bilateral or rightsided activation in the temporo-parietal regions when the manipulating
action contrasted with non-manipulating action. The overall results indicate that the differential hand action experience does influence on the
neural representation of manipulating action concepts along the dorsal
pathway, but not on the category-specificity of object representations in
the ventral pathway.

Sensorimotor-based theories of semantic memory claim that semantic
?information about an object is distributed over the neural substrates
that are? invoked when we perceive and interact with that object. This
predicts that? occupying a neural substrate that is an important part of
an object’s? representation (e.g., with a concurrent secondary task)
should interfere with? the ability to access that representation. We tested
this prediction as it? pertains to the manipulation component of an
object’s representation by ?requiring participants to make concreteness
judgments about (heard) names of objects under conditions of? “interference” (performing a concurrent manual or visual task) or “no? interference” (no concurrent task). Objects varied (according to ratings) in the
extent to which one interacts with them manually? (e.g., tiger = low manual interaction, kitten = high manual interaction).? Results show that
performing a concurrent task increases? errors for all objects. Critically,
however, when performing a manual task the increase in errors is? greatest for objects rated as high in manual interaction. In contrast, a concurrent visual task does not selectively increase errors for manual objects.
This interference ?effect suggests that the conceptual representations of
frequently ?manipulated objects share resources (specifically, motor
resources) with those ?that are required to perform an overt manual task.
Further, it suggests that ?motor information about these objects is

FEATURE DIAGNOSTICITY AFFECTS THE REPRESENTATION OF NOVEL
OBJECT CATEGORIES Nina S. Hsu1, Margaret L. Schlichting2, Sharon L.

Thompson-Schill1; 1University of Pennsylvania, 2University of Texas at Austin —

Distributed models of semantic memory posit that information about
objects is stored in brain regions responsible for perceiving that information. Such models describe differences between the representations of
objects from different categories by assuming that some features (such as
color) are more diagnostic of object identity for some categories (e.g.,
fruit) than others (e.g., tools). Rarely, however, has feature diagnosticity
been directly manipulated in order to determine its role in object representations. We explored the role of feature diagnosticity through a training paradigm, in which subjects learn that for a given set of novel objects
with assigned colors and names, color is a necessary feature (similar to
the yellow of lemons), or they learn that color is an available feature but
not necessary (similar to the red of stop signs). Following training, subjects recalled object names and colors accurately, but behavioral measures showed group differences. When listing adjectives to describe the
objects, color-necessary subjects nearly always listed colors first, whereas
color-available subjects rarely did. When rating similarity for two objects
of the same color, color-necessary subjects assigned higher ratings than
color-available subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)

results demonstrate that when retrieving object shape information, brain
regions involved in color or shape perception are activated differently
for color-necessary subjects than for color-available subjects. These
results suggest that feature diagnosticity interacts with object knowledge
in ways previously uninvestigated, and also provide behavioral and
neural measures for capturing details of object representations, which
may be richer and more nuanced than previously thought.

MENTAL IMAGERY MODULATES KNOWLEDGE ABOUT OBJECTS AND
FACES AT MULTIPLE TIMES Haline E. Schendan1, Giorgio Ganis1,2,3;

University of Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, UK, 2Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA, 3Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA — The brain

basis of meaning has been elusive. Recently, grounded (embodied) cognition theory has enjoyed increasing support and proposes that meaning
depends, to some extent, on sensorimotor processes and introspective
states. This theory also proposes that mental simulation is the process
that grounds cognition. Simulation is a type of mental imagery that reenacts sensorimotor or introspection processes in the neocortex that had
been associated together during prior learning experiences to construct
the concept. This predicts that mental imagery should modulate sensory
processing related to visual knowledge. To test this, event-related potentials were recorded to pictures of objects and faces while people mentally
visualized either the same object or face (congruent condition) or different ones (incongruent condition). Results show that mental imagery
enhances the N170/VPP, as reported previously (Ganis & Schendan,
2008). In addition, after 200 ms, the frontocentral N3 complex was less
negative to objects congruent than incongruent with ongoing mental
imagery. The frontal N400 to faces showed the same. Later, the late positive complex (LPC) showed the opposite congruity effect. These effects
resemble semantic congruity effects to pictures in sentence and scene
contexts. However, the centroparietal linguistic N400 showed minimal
mental imagery effects, demonstrating the visual sensory (non-linguistic) nature of imagery effects. Thus, to ground knowledge in visual object
processing, two types of mental simulation operate at two times. Automatic simulation operates between 200 and 500 ms during frontal negativities indexing object knowledge, and strategic simulation operates
between 400 and 700 ms during LPC indices of strategic mental visualization.

BRAIN DAMAGE TO AUDITORY CORTEX AFFECTS THE PROCESSING OF

semantic memory organisation has been accumulating during the last
years. A previous study provided direct evidence for a link between the
perceptual and conceptual brain systems by showing that visually presented words referring to sound-related concepts recruit auditory brain
regions in posterior superior/middle temporal gyrus (pSTG/MTG).
However, it is an open question whether auditory brain areas play a
causal role in processing sound-related concepts. To address this issue,
we investigated patient JR, who received a focal lesion in left pSTG/
MTG. We compared JR’s performance with six matched control subjects
in four different experiments: (I) Lexical decision on visually presented
words referring to objects with high versus low acoustic feature relevance and pseudowords, (II) category fluency on tools, animals and
acoustic objects, (III) sound recognition, testing the ability to match
sounds of animals, musical instruments and other acoustic objects with
visually presented words/pictures of corresponding objects and (IV)
voice classification of male/female voice recordings, requiring a decision
on the speakers gender. Analysis of the behavioural data showed that
JR’s lexical decisions on words with high acoustic feature relevance were
significantly slower and less accurate, he generated less acoustic objects,
and his reactions in artifact sound recognition were significantly slowed
down. Voice classification was intact. The results revealed across tasks a
selective, but consistent impairment in JR, affecting processing of sound-

198

related concepts and recognition of object sounds. Going beyond correlational neuroimaging results, these unique findings show that modalityspecific cortex plays a causal role in conceptual processing.

3Karolinska Institute, Sweden — To date, neuroimaging data converge on

the idea that multiple neural systems are involved in implicit sequence
learning. However, no consensus has been reached on the specific function of these different neural systems. In the present fMRI study, we
wanted to test the idea that the neural activation involved in implicit
sequence learning is defined by the type of information that is being
learned. Participants were scanned while performing a perceptual or
motor version of an identical serial color matching paradigm. Imaging
results indicated that implicit sequences can be acquired by at least two
neural systems: the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus, having different operating principles. The caudate nucleus contributed to the
implicit sequence learning process for perceptual as well as motor information in a similar and gradual way. The hippocampus, on the other
hand, was engaged in a much faster learning process which was more
pronounced for the motor compared to the perceptual task. Interestingly, the perceptual and motor learning process occurred on a comparable implicit level, suggesting that consciousness is not the main
determinant factor dissociating the hippocampal from the caudate learning system. To fully understand the distinct learning function of both
neural systems, it appears that other factors, such as the type of information, need to be taken into account.

WHO READS THE INSTRUCTIONS, ANYWAY? EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE
BENEFITS PERCEPTUAL-MOTOR SEQUENCE LEARNING INDEPENDENT
OF INSTRUCTION Daniel J. Sanchez1, Abigail H. Wesley1, Paul J. Reber1;

1Northwestern University — Motor skill training, outside of the laboratory,
is typically accompanied by explicit instruction for the sequence of
motor movements to be learned. However, expert performance is often
unaccompanied by awareness of the sequence being executed, suggesting a role for implicit learning. Perceptual-motor sequence learning was
assessed with, and without, explicit pre-instruction in order to examine
the effect of explicit instruction on skill learning. Participants in the
explicit instruction condition observed the 12-item training sequence five
times before training, whereas in the implicit condition no mention was
made of the repeating sequence. Both groups received 2880 trials of
training with the Serial Interception Sequence Learning (SISL) task, followed by tests of implicit and explicit sequence knowledge. In the SISL
task, cues scroll vertically towards targets on a computer screen and participants attempt to press a corresponding key when a cue reaches its target zone. Explicit instruction did not reliably affect sequence learning
overall, but did lead to high levels of explicit knowledge in many, but
not all, of these participants. Some participants in the implicit training
condition acquired significant explicit knowledge as well. Participants
were divided post-hoc into high and low explicit knowledge groups by
the median of the sequence recognition test scores. Participants with
greater explicit knowledge exhibited better learning of the embedded
repeating sequence than those with only implicit knowledge, after an initial period of similar performance. This suggests that even with a continuous performance task requiring precisely timed responses, explicit
knowledge provides a benefit to procedural learning.

M. Blomeke1, Sandra Weintraub2, Paul J. Reber1; 1Northwestern University,

2Northwestern Feinberg School Of Medicine — Skilled

performance of complex motor skills requires learning a specific order of movements with
precise timing. The Serial Interception Sequence Learning (SISL) task has
been used to study this type of perceptual-motor sequence learning.
During SISL, participants make keypress responses to coincide with the
passage of a moving spatial cue though a target zone. Participants are
not told that the cues follow a repeating sequence, but implicit sequence
knowledge is observed through sequence-specific performance enhancement. Implicit learning with little concomitant explicit knowledge of the
sequence has been demonstrated in undergraduate populations. This
implicit-explicit memory dissociation is likely enhanced by the continuous performance demands and video-game-like interface. However, it is
not known if SISL will be an effective tool for examining sequence learning in older adults given the overall task difficulty. Cognitively healthy
elderly participants (mean age 70.0 years, range 63 – 76) performed a
modified SISL task designed to provide an appropriate level of difficulty. The number of possible responses was reduced to three (making
the task unimanual) and an initial performance pre-assessment identified an appropriate cue velocity for each participant. As in prior
research, cues followed a 12-item repeating sequence during 80% of
training trials. On a subsequent test phase, participants exhibited
implicit sequence knowledge but no ability to recognize or recall the
trained sequence. This cognitively healthy elderly sample demonstrated
reliable implicit learning and would serve as a suitable comparison
group for patient populations with impaired memory function, such as
those with MCI, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.

CONSOLIDATION IN IMPLICIT SEQUENCE LEARNING: RETROACTIVE

1
Northwestern University, 2Chatham University — Memory consolidation is a
vital process by which knowledge representations become stable and
long-lasting. While well-studied in declarative memory, implicit skill
learning also appears to undergo a consolidation process after the training period. Immediately after learning a new motor sequence, knowledge may be vulnerable to retroactive interference from learning of
another novel sequence. To assess whether retroactive interference is
observed during implicit perceptual-motor sequence learning, participants learned three different 12-item second-order conditional sequences
over two sessions using the Serial Interception Sequence Learning (SISL)
task. In the SISL task, cues scroll vertically towards targets on a computer screen. Participants attempt to press a corresponding key when a
cue reaches its target zone. During the first session participants trained
on a first sequence (A), which was immediately followed by training on
a second sequence (B). Either 24 or 48 hours later, participants returned
for a second session and trained on a third sequence (C), followed by
tests for implicit and explicit sequence knowledge for all three
sequences. Retroactive interference for sequence A was observed in participants who had low explicit knowledge of sequence A, but not in participants with high explicit knowledge. No interference was observed for
sequence B, for which there was a substantial delay period prior to learning sequence C. These results suggest that implicit sequence learning
requires a consolidation period to avoid retroactive interference, but this
interference effect can be ameliorated by concomitant explicit sequence
knowledge.

resources that, when depleted, produce deficits in self-regulation or cognitive control. Depletion effects on implicit learning, which is not
thought to require cognitive control, have not previously been reported.
However, if depletion reflects transiently lower levels of dopamine, egodepletion might be associated with slower learning for tasks dependent
on dopamine-gated plasticity in cortico-striatal circuits. The relationship
between ego-depletion and implicit learning was examined by comparing participants’ levels of cognitive depletion with sequence learning
performance. Participants first completed the Stroop Task to assess
depletion, measured as the reaction time difference between control and
incongruent trials. Participants then performed the Serial Interception
Sequence Learning (SISL) task. The SISL task is a perceptual-motor
sequence learning task whereby circular cues scroll across a computer
screen toward targets, and participants attempt to press the correct key
when a cue fits within the target zone. Participants received 2880 trials of
training on a covertly embedded 12-item second-order conditional
sequence, followed by tests of both implicit and explicit sequence knowledge. Implicit sequence knowledge was assessed as the percent correct
difference between performance on the trained sequence and novel
sequences. A negative correlation was found between the interference
effect and the amount of implicit learning exhibited, with a slightly
stronger relationship observed for participants who did not demonstrate
explicit knowledge of the sequence. These results show that ego depletion may lead to slower implicit learning, implying this process is not as
automatic as previously hypothesized.

ENHANCING MOTOR MEMORY FOR A MELODIC SEQUENCE BY REPLAYING THE MELODY DURING SLEEP James W. Antony1, Eric W. Gobel1,
Justin K. O'Hare1, Paul J. Reber1, Ken A. Paller1; 1Northwestern University — A

steadily increasing body of evidence supports a role for sleep in memory
reactivation and consolidation. Memory traces are thought to be spontaneously reactivated during sleep, enhancing storage and improving subsequent memory performance. This natural process can apparently be
triggered by auditory or olfactory stimuli during sleep, if those stimuli
had previously been linked with learning (Rasch et al., 2007; Rudoy et
al., 2009; Smith & Weeden, 1990). We now report that motor memories
for a 12-item musical sequence, played using four fingers on four keys in
time with moving visual cues (as in the video game, "Guitar Hero"), can
be improved by presenting the corresponding tone sequences during
sleep. Sixteen participants explicitly learned two repeating melodies
composed with either four high tones or four low tones. Training
involved 40 repetitions of each sequence in interleaved blocks. Performance was tested before and after a 90-minute afternoon nap. Responses
were scored as correct only if made with the correct key and within the
target time window. Performance on the learned sequences was superior
to performance on novel sequences. Crucially, one musical sequence was
played softly through a speaker 20 times during a 4-minute segment of
slow-wave sleep, without the participants' knowledge. After the nap, but
not before, performance was significantly better on the cued sequence
than on the non-cued sequence. These results demonstrate that motor
memories can be selectively enhanced during sleep, most likely because
reinstating the tone sequence reactivated corresponding representations
of the visual cues and/or the learned motor sequence.

ing task practice is affected by CI. Ten adults practiced a serial reaction
time task where a set of three 4-element sequences were arranged in a
repetitive or in an interleaved order on 2 successive days. On Day 5, subjects were tested with practiced sequences to evaluate retention. A
within-subjects design was used so that subjects practiced sequences in
the other condition (repetitive or interleaved) 2-4 weeks later. Functional
images were acquired online during practice and retention. Psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) was applied to determine the connectivity between PM and M1 during practice. We identified a CI effect in
that while reaction times (RT) in the interleaved condition were slower
than the repetitive condition during practice (effect size (ES)= 0.8) the
reverse was true during retention on Day 5, with faster RT for sequences
practiced under interleaved conditions (ES= 0.9). Between-condition differences in PM-M1 connectivity were found during practice (FDR, p<
0.05), with greater connectivity during interleaved practice. These results
suggest that the CI effect can be demonstrated in a within-subject design.
The results also suggest that interleaved practice is accompanied by
increased PM-M1 connectivity, which may support the superior retention of practiced sequences.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF MULTIPLE TIME SCALES DURING LONG-TERM
MOTOR SEQUENCE LEARNING Nicholas F Wymbs1, Scott T Grafton1; 1UC
Santa Barbara — Neuroimaging experiments have identified rapid neural
changes with initial training, but few demonstrate plasticity for slower
time scales that occur alongside extensive training. This experiment
identified both fast and slow time scale regions. Participants trained for
30 days on 3 pairs of visually cued 10-element sequences that mapped 5
squares onto a keyboard. Training exposure varied between sequences,
with two receiving minimal training (fast scale), two moderate training
(intermediate scale), and two extensive training (slow scale). BOLD was
acquired every 10 sessions, during which 50 trials of each sequence were
presented. The repetition suppression (RS) effect was used to measure
subtle changes by repeating pairs of sequences separately for each time
scale group. Decreased RS sensitivity was found in motor cortex, vermis,
putamen, temporal lobe, and fusiform cortex for fast time scales, along
with increased sensitivity in the supplementary/cingulate motor areas
and inferior frontal operculum. An inverse quadratic characterized
regions showing changes at intermediate time scales, including dorsal
premotor, supramarginal gyrus, posterior parietal cortex, and the right
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Slow decreases in RS sensitivity
were located in the left dominant hemisphere, including the intraparietal
sulcus, lateral premotor cortex, precuneus, lateral cerebellum, and
DLPFC. These results highlight the recruitment of a premotor-parietal
network as one initially learns a sequential motor skill. DLPFC recruitment suggests that higher-level processing regions function at slower
time scales, supporting the development of automaticity. Lastly, the lack
of slow increasing sensitivity suggests that progression towards automaticity is characterized by increased efficiency within sensorimotor networks.

DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF FEEDBACK NOVELTY ON IMPLICIT VERSUS
EXPLICIT CATEGORY LEARNING Benjamin O. Turner1, Andrew Ross1, F.

Gregory Ashby1; 1University of California, Santa Barbara — Novelty is a powerful salience cue, interacting with both the attention and dopamine systems. In particular, novelty can capture attention—thereby enhancing
cognitive processing (e.g., Corbetta, 2002)—and can also cause dopaminergic neurons to fire (e.g., Horvitz, 2000). In the COVIS model of category learning (Ashby et al., 1998), the explicit system is only affected by
dopamine in a tonic manner, but depends heavily on attentional processes, while the implicit system is largely attention-independent, relying instead on phasic dopaminergic signals to guide learning. Because
positive and negative feedback play different roles in the two systems,
we hypothesized that we would observe different patterns of behavior in
the two systems when replacing either positive or negative feedback
with novel images: in the implicit system, novel negative feedback

200

should cause a small dopamine release, thereby strengthening the incorrect synapse and impairing learning, while novel positive feedback
should have no such detrimental effect; and in the explicit system, negative feedback is logically more informative than positive feedback, so
increasing the processing of negative feedback via novelty should lead to
relatively better performance compared to doing so for positive feedback. The results of a behavioral study using this design support these
predictions, such that for accuracy there is a significant interaction
between category distribution (i.e., rule-based or information-integration) and feedback condition (i.e., whether positive or negative feedback
is novel): subjects in the rule-based condition performed significantly
better when negative feedback was novel compared to positive, while
for subjects in the information-integration condition, this pattern was
reversed.

APATHY AND PERCEPTUAL CATEGORY LEARNING IN PARKINSON'S

Filoteo1,2, W. Todd Maddox3, David P. Salmon1, Stephanie L. Lessig1,2, David D.
Song1,2; 1UCSD, 2VA San Diego Healthcare System, 3University of Texas — Past
evidence indicates that the ventral striatum plays an important role in
reinforcement-based learning via dopamine signaling following reward.
Recent studies have indicated that apathy, which reduces the ability to
benefit from reinforcers in the environment, is highly prevalent in
patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and has been associated with
ventral striatal dysfunction. Given this past work, we hypothesized that
PD patients high in apathy (PD-HA) would be differentially impaired
relative to PD patients low in apathy (PD-LA) on tasks that emphasize
reinforcement-based learning. We examined 31 PD-HA and 39 PD-LA
patients using an implicit, information-integration category learning task
in which subjects were asked to classify individual stimuli into one of
two categories and were given corrective feedback following each
response. Results indicated that the PD-HA patients were impaired relative to both PD-LA and normal controls, whereas the latter two groups
did not differ. Importantly, level of depression was not associated with
performance on the implicit category learning task. To test whether the
impact of apathy was specific to implicit learning, we examined the same
group of PD patients on an explicit, rule-based task (for which verbal
rules can be used to describe category membership) and found that apathy was not associated with performance, whereas PD patients with high
levels of depression were impaired. These results suggest that possible
ventral striatal dysfunction in PD-HA patients may be associated with
impaired implicit but not explicit category learning, whereas levels of
depression may have the opposite relationship.

UNLEARNING AND EXTINCTION IN A PROCEDURAL-LEARNING
CATEGORIZATION TASK Matthew J. Crossley1, F. Gregory Ashby1, Brian D.

Glass2, W. Todd Maddox2; 1University of California, Santa Barbara, 2University
of Texas, Austin — Evidence suggests that information-integration category learning recruits procedural memory and requires reinforcement
learning mediated within the striatum. However, virtually nothing is
known about how this categorization knowledge can be “unlearned”.
We make a critical distinction between performance decrements that
might suggest unlearning and true unlearning at the synaptic level. We
report the results from two experiments designed to investigate the ability of random feedback to induce true unlearning of information-integration categories and to investigate the impact of training context on the
learning and expression of information-integration categorization.
Experiment 1 included an acquisition, extinction, and reacquisition
phase. Participants learned information-integration categories using
standard feedback-based training during the acquisition and reacquisition phases, and they received random feedback during the extinction
phase. Results indicated that random feedback is sufficient to suppress
the expression of procedural categorization but not to induce true
unlearning of the category structures (because reacquisition was faster
than initial acquisition). Experiment 2 included an acquisition phase and

Tuesday, April 5, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session H
two extinction phases that occurred in different contexts (i.e., different
background colors). Results indicated that the expression of categorization knowledge after extinction can be briefly renewed by returning to
the original training context. Taken together, the results from Experiments 1 and 2 echo some classic findings in instrumental conditioning
(i.e., rapid reacquisition and renewal) and are inconsistent with many
current category learning models. Finally, we propose a new neurobiologically detailed theory of information-integration category learning
that accounts for these results.

task practice is affected by CI. Ten adults practiced a serial reaction time
task where a set of three 4-element sequences were arranged in a repetitive or in an interleaved order on 2 successive days. On Day 5, subjects
were tested with practiced sequences to evaluate retention. A withinsubjects design was used so that subjects practiced sequences in the
other condition (repetitive or interleaved) 2-4 weeks later. Functional

between DLPFC and SMA during practice. We identified a CI effect in
that while reaction times (RT) in the interleaved condition were slower

0.05), with greater connectivity during interleaved practice. These results
suggest that the CI effect can be demonstrated in a within-subject design.
The results also suggest that interleaved practice is accompanied by
increased DLPFC-SMA connectivity, which may support the superior
retention of practiced sequences.

University of California, San Francisco — During both implicit and explicit
sequence learning, the learnt sequence is encoded in a format that can be
transferred across modalities. Sequences transferrable across disparate
effector types are likely to be coded at a cortical level unbound to either
stimulus or response modality. We examined cortical oscillations, with
magnetoencephalography (MEG), during sequence learning and transfer
while subjects performed a modified serial reaction time task in the manual (button press) and vocal (short vowels) response domains. Both
implicit and explicit learning effects were explored. Five-dimensional
neuroimaging was performed from whole-head MEG data using Nutmeg (nutmeg.berkeley.edu). Salient transfer effects were quantified by a
reduction in reaction times to learned sequences produced by untrained
effectors. Transfer effects were symmetric between manual and vocal
learning and observed for both implicit and explicit learning. During
training, we observed significant power changes in the beta-band (1530Hz) over pre-frontal (PFC) and motor cortices. In the transfer phase,

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

power increases in the high-gamma band (65-90Hz) were observed over
dorsal pre-motor cortex (PMd) and the superior parietal lobe (SPL) during manual-to-vocal transfer. In contrast, during vocal to manual transfer, power increases in the high-gamma band were over dorsolateral
PFC and the supplementary motor area (SMA). These results suggest
that the process of translating a learned motor sequence pattern across
effectors is mediated by high-frequency oscillatory activity in frontal cortex.

PARSING THE EFFECT OF COMT GENOTYPES ON DIMENSION SELECTION
AND CRITERION LEARNING IN RULE-BASED CATEGORIZATION

Sebastien Helie1, Erick J. Paul1, Benjamin O. Turner1, Nicole C. Foley1, Colin
Gerber1, Angela Chen1, F. Gregory Ashby1; 1University of California, Santa
Barbara — Seger and Cincotta (Cerebral Cortex, 2006) showed that medial
temporal lobe activation is negatively correlated with performance in
rule-based categorization. More recently, Dennis and her colleagues
(Cerebral Cortex, 2010) showed that participants homozygous for Val on
the COMT gene had generally more activation in the prefrontal cortex
and less activation in the medial temporal lobes, whereas participants
homozygous for Met on the COMT gene had the opposite. Together,
these results suggest that extracting participant genotypes on the COMT
gene should allow us to predict their performance in a rule-based categorization task. Rule-based categorization involves at least two stages: (1)
dimension selection and, (2) criterion learning. Thirty-seven participants
were trained in two separate rule-based categorization tasks each focusing either on dimension selection or criterion learning. The results show
that participants homozygous for Val were more accurate than participants with at least one Met allele in the criterion learning task. In addition, accuracy of participants homozygous for Met was worse than those
with at least one Val allele in the criterion learning task. Similar results
were found in the dimension selection task. Participants homozygous for
Val could solve more problems in fewer trials than participants with at
least one Met allele, who in turn could solve more problems in fewer trials than participants homozygous for Met. Hence, the Val allele seems to
provide an advantage over the Met allele in rule-based perceptual category learning. These results are consistent with Seger & Cincotta (2006)
and Dennis et al. (2010).

DOPAMINERGIC EFFECTS ON BRAIN ACTIVATION DURING MOTOR
Kwak1,
SEQUENCE LEARNING IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE Youngbin
Martijn Muller1, Nicolaas Bohnen1, Praveen Dayalu1, Rachael Seidler1;
1University of Michigan — We recently reported that the effect of dopamin-

ergic medication varies across the time course of motor sequence learning in early stage Parkinson’s (PD) patients (Kwak et al., 2010). We found
a medication-associated impairment that was specific to the early phase
of learning. In the current study, we investigated the neural substrate of
this deleterious effect of L-DOPA on motor sequence learning. We
hypothesized that L-DOPA would affect recruitment of the ventral striatal circuitry during the early phase of motor sequence learning. Seventeen early stage PD patients ON and OFF L-DOPA and 21 healthy
control participants performed an explicit motor sequence learning task
inside the MRI scanner. Paralleling our previous findings, we found an
L-DOPA associated sequence learning impairment when learning was
measured by error rate. We found sequence learning-specific activation
during the early phase in the ventral putamen for controls and PD OFF
but not for PD ON L-DOPA. A comparison of activation between PD
OFF and PD ON within the ventral putamen showed that activation was
decreased in PD ON compared to PD OFF. The degree of L-DOPA associated activation decrease was positively correlated with the degree of
sequence learning impairment in the early phase of learning. These findings provide evidence for the differential effects of L-DOPA across the
ventral and dorsal cortico-striatal loops involved in motor sequence
learning in Parkinson’s disease.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SPATIAL NAVIGATION: THE INFLUENCE OF
COGNITIVE STYLES David J.M. Kraemer1, Victor R. Schinazi1, Philip B.

Cawkwell1, Russell A. Epstein1, Sharon L. Thompson-Schill1; 1University of
Pennsylvania — Navigation in large-scale environments relies on integrat-

ing multiple information sources. Individuals differ in overall navigation
ability and in choice of task strategies. One reliable, and potentially relevant, individual difference is preference for using visual or verbal information to complete a visual task – e.g., when recalling a previously seen
picture, some tend to rely primarily on visual memory, while others
focus on retrieving a verbal label. These separable preferences, visual
and verbal cognitive styles, correlate with reasoning in visual and verbal
domains. Recent neuroimaging evidence (Kraemer et al., 2009 JNeuroscience) linked these cognitive styles to separate task strategies associated with distinct brain regions. Specifically, left supramarginal gyrus
activity was correlated with the verbal cognitive style labeling strategy,
particularly during a visual task. Likewise, right fusiform gyrus activity
during a verbal task was correlated with a visual cognitive strategy.
Here, using novel large-scale virtual environments, we demonstrate that
cognitive styles are differentially predictive of performance on navigation tasks that make use of different strategies. Specifically, landmark
memory can rely on both visual and verbal strategies, while spatial integration measures, like judgments of relative direction (JRDs), rely primarily on visual strategies. Here, higher visual cognitive style predicted
better performance on both landmark judgments and JRDs, while higher
verbal style predicted performance for landmarks but not JRDs.
Together, these results support the hypothesis that cognitive styles represent distinct strategies corresponding to differences in how individuals
represent task-related information, in this case landmark memory and
spatial position.

for the Neural Basis of Cognition —

Fluency in math has previously been conceptualized in terms of memorization of single-digit “math facts” (Resnick, 1983). The current study is
part of an alternative effort, testing the influence of improving the quality of basic number representation on math fluency. In a recently completed neuroimaging study we found broad transfer for different math
tasks following an arithmetic training program designed to engage procedural learning mechanisms. In an fMRI version of the training task, the
basal ganglia showed characteristic activation for correct and incorrect
trials. In the current study we sought to test the components of the training program that were considered essential for procedural learning, by
manipulating three parameters between subjects: contingent feedback,
incentive value of positive results, and uncertainty about outcomes.
Eighty participants were behaviorally tested with variety of mathrelated tasks before and after a training program that consisted of rarely
repeating addition and subtraction problems. The base group received
trial-by-trial feedback, monetary rewards for correct answers, and short
response-windows to increase uncertainty. Each of the other three
groups lacked one of these parameters. Following training, participants
in all groups improved in an SAT-like test, math-fact retrieval, and a
Stroop-like task testing automaticity of double-digit numbers addition.
However, unlike the other two groups, the Base and No-feedback
groups also showed improvement in numerical representation (symbolic
and non-symbolic). We conclude that although improvement in math
fluency followed all training procedures, motivation to succeed and
response pressure to change computational habits led to additional representational change.

Ullman1; 1Georgetown University, 2University of Illinois, Chicago, 3Federal
University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil — Although the neural bases of L2

processing have been increasingly well-studied, major empirical gaps
remain. One issue that is still largely unexamined is whether and how
the neurocognition of L2 changes after a period of non¬-exposure to the
language, a situation that is not uncommon in L2 learning and use. Here
we test whether and how the performance and brain bases of proficient
L2 learners change after a period of non-exposure to the language, and
how such changes may depend on the type of L2 training. We followed
up on a recent ERP study of an artificial language that allowed us to control for the presence/absence as well as type of L2 exposure. In the initial
study, subjects received either explicit (classroom-like) or implicit
(immersion-like) training, and underwent behavioral and ERP testing at
both low and high proficiency (Morgan-Short et al., 2010; under review).
In response to grammatical violations, subjects showed natural language
and other ERP components (LAN, P600, N400, late anterior negativity,
early anterior positivity), though the exact pattern varied as a function of
exposure type (explicit, implicit), proficiency (low, high) and grammatical violation (phrase-structure, agreement). In this follow-up study subjects returned 3 to 6 months later. Preliminary analyses suggest that this
delay yielded no significant loss of proficiency, but changes in the ERP
patterns, including the disappearance of components (e.g., anterior positivities), the appearance of new components (e.g., P600s), and the
strengthening of components (e.g., anterior negativities). Explanatory
hypotheses (consolidation in memory systems) and implications are discussed.

BROCA'S AREA DOES NOT ONLY SUBSERVE VERBAL WORKING
MEMORY Lars Meyer1, Jonas Obleser1, Angela D. Friederici1; 1Max Planck
Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany — Does
Broca’s Area only provide the neural substrate for verbal working memory during sentence comprehension? We challenged this vigorously discussed issue in language neuropsychology by crossing a syntactic
processing factor (subject-first vs. object-first sentences) with a verbal
working memory factor (short vs. long argument–verb dependencies).
German syntax permits full crossing, unlike in English, where any contrast between object- and subject-first sentences is confounded with a
difference in argument–verb dependency length. Presenting 24 participants with such sentences in an auditory fMRI study, the syntactic processing factor (= object-first vs. subject-first sentences) focally activated
the left pars opercularis (x = –57, y = 17, z = 10, z = 3.47, p < 0.005), while
the verbal working memory factor (= long vs. short argument–verb
dependencies) activated the deep left supramarginal gyrus and planum
temporale (x = –42, y = –40, z = 10, z = 3.14, p < 0.005). A negative correlation between this activation and digit span (r = –0.55, p < 0.05) suggests
a central role in verbal working memory for the left supramarginal gyrus
and planum temporale. Our results speak against Broca’s Area only subserving verbal working memory. Rather, Broca’s Area seems to support
a computational faculty for syntactic processing, which operates on representations in verbal working memory as subserved by the left supramarginal gyus and planum temporale.

Neuroscience, Berlin, Germany, 3Graduate School of Mind and Brain, Berlin,
Germany — Language processing is a higher cognitive function that
requires syntactic operations in order to build a sentence structure. It has
been suggested recently that local violations of such syntactic structures
can modulate the activations in sensory cortex areas, while other studies
found only regions outside the sensory cortices. The current eventrelated auditory fMRI study investigates the relative contributions of the
auditory sensory cortices in syntactic processing. Two-word utterances
were presented in a 2 x 2 stimulus design that varied the grammaticality
(syntactically correct or incorrect) as well as the perceptual markedness
(presence or absence of an overt word category marking "–t") of the
utterances. A conventional univariate cognitive subtraction analysis was
applied together with a multivariate pattern classification approach.
Stronger activation was found for syntactically incorrect compared to
correct utterances in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG), the superior temporal sulcus (STS) as well as
in the right STS/STG. The information within local multivariate patterns
indicated syntax-sensitivity to be strongest in the IFG, aSTG and STS of
the left hemisphere. Importantly, the neural activation patterns of the
auditory cortices were only modulated by the overt perceptual marking,
but not by grammaticality. Thus, the present results speak against syntax-sensitive sensory cortex areas, but provide strong evidence for a distinction between regions involved in syntactic operations and regions
involved in pure perceptual processes.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF RULE-BASED ANOMALIES IN
ARTIFICIAL GRAMMAR LEARNING Michelle Hendricks1, Christopher

Conway1, John Purdy1; 1Saint Louis University — We

used event-related
potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neural correlates of artificial grammar learning. Test items were divided into two categories based on
superficial similarity (i.e. frequency of bigrams and trigrams) to training
exemplars, such that low chunk test items were less superficially similar
to training exemplars than high chunk test items (see Knowlton &
Squire, 1996). Prior to recording the EEG, we trained participants (N=10)
on letter strings generated from the grammar by requiring them to type
each exemplar presented. The EEG was time-locked to the initial presentation of the test item, immediately prior to the grammaticality judgment. We recorded the EEG from 128 scalp electrodes using an EGI
Geodesic Sensor Net; impedances were below 50 k?. Results indicated a
robust P600-like component (with a centro-parietal distribution) for nongrammatical low chunk test items, but not for non-grammatical high
chunk items, for which superficial similarity and grammaticality are confounded. The results are consistent with previous research finding a
P600 (elicited in natural language tasks involving syntactic violations),
but no LAN, for rule-based violations in artificial grammar learning
tasks (Christiansen, Conway, & Onnis, 2007; Friederici, Steinhauer, &
Pfeifer, 2002). The results are also consistent with research finding dissociable neural correlates for surface vs. rule processing, suggesting a specific role for the P600 in the detection of rule-based anomalies (Lelekov,
Dominey, & Garica-Larrea, 2000; Nunez-Pena & Honrubia-Serrano,
2004). Finally, the results have implications for the generality of mechanisms underlying both the learning of artificial rule-based grammars
and natural language processing.

University, 2Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Mass General Hospital —

It has been proposed that aspects of syntactic processing draw upon general executive processes which detect and resolve conflict between competing representations. A major feature of general conflict detection and
resolution operations is their dynamic nature: increased conflict leads to
the recruitment of additional cognitive resources, facilitating the resolution of subsequent conflicts. The present study aimed to determine

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

whether the P600 – an event-related potential (ERP) associated with syntactic processing and conflict detection and resolution processes – is similarly subject to such a dynamic adjustment of control. In experimental
paradigms of non-linguistic executive function, the dynamic adjustment
of control manifests as the Gratton effect: a reduced cost in processing
conflict trials preceded by other conflict trials, relative to those preceded
by non-conflict trials. To determine whether a Gratton effect occurs in
syntactic processing, we re-analyzed data from four ERP experiments in
which syntactic violations in English sentences evoked robust P600
effects. We found clear effects of trial history on the P600 within and
across experiments. When preceded by other syntactic violations, the
amplitude of the P600 to syntactic violations was smaller than when preceded by non-violated sentences. In contrast, there was no effect of trial
history on the N400 evoked by real-world violations in the same experiments. These findings suggest that aspects of syntactic processing are
subject to similar dynamic control operations as classic tasks of executive
function.

DISTINCT NEURAL PROCESSES ENGAGED DURING TEMPORAL
SEQUENCING AND COHERENCE BUILDING DURING DISCOURSE
PROCESSING Wonja M. Fairbrother1, Martin Paczynski1, Eric. C. Fields1,2,
Gina R. Kuperberg1,2; 1Tufts University, 2Massachusetts General Hospital — In

the real world, causes always come before effects, while in communication, events can be described in either this canonical temporal order
using causal connectors such as “and so”, or in non-canonical order
using connectors like “because”. Using event-related potentials (ERPs),
we determined whether the canonical sequencing of events influences
the establishment of causal coherence, or vice versa, during online discourse processing. Two-clause cause/effect sentences were created, in
which we fully crossed temporal sequencing of events with discourse
coherence, yielding four experimental conditions (example set: Fred was
hungry [and so/*because] he ate…; Fred ate [*and so/because] he was
hungry…”). 24 participants read these sentences, presented word-byword (450ms, ISI: 100ms), and made acceptability judgments at the end
of each sentence. At anterior electrode sites, ERPs to critical words (“ate/
hungry”) in clauses appearing in non-canonical sequence evoked a
larger negativity between 350-450ms than in clauses appearing in canonical temporal sequence. This effect was particularly marked in the causally incoherent scenarios. At centro-parietal sites, ERPs to critical words
in incoherent clauses evoked a larger negativity between 350-450ms (an
N400 effect) and a larger positivity between 500-800ms (a P600 effect)
than in coherent clauses. Together, these results suggest that during discourse comprehension, establishing the temporal sequencing of events
and establishing their causal coherence are driven by distinct but interactive neural mechanisms.

CROSS-LINGUISTIC VARIATIONS AND SIMILARITIES: AN ERP STUDY OF
MANDARIN WH-CONSTRUCTIONS Ming Xiang1, Fengqin Liu2, Peiyao

Chen2, Taomei Guo2; 1University of Chicago, 2Beijing Normal University — Whdependencies are known to elicit extra processing cost since the parser
needs to establish a long distance relationship between the fronted whphrase and its theta role position, as in the sentence “Emily wondered
which pop star the performer in the concert had imitated….” (Kann et al,
2000; Phillips et al. 2005). However, many of the world languages exhibit
a different syntactic pattern, such that the wh-phrases actually stay in
their canonical theta position (literally in Mandarin, “Emily wondered
the performer in the concert had imitated which pop star...”). To investigate whether this type of wh-constructions also evoke extra processing
cost like their English counterparts, the current study recorded ERPs
while native Mandarin speakers (n=24) read the following sentences (in
Mandarin) and performed an acceptability judgment task: (1) declaratives “The teacher persuaded John (for his dreams) to apply for that
school.”; (2)interrogative wh-questions “The teacher persuaded John (for
his dreams) to apply for which school?”; (3)embedded wh-questions
“The teacher asked John (for his dreams) applied for which school.”.

Another three “long” conditions were created by adding a prepositional
phrase (“for his dreams”) before the lowest verb. There were 30 trials/
condition. An equal number (n=180) of unacceptable sentences served as
fillers. The results indeed show an extra processing cost for wh-constructions. At the last noun phrase, the long (2) and (3) elicited a bigger P600
compared to the long (1); there was no difference between the former
two. But this effect was not observed for the short conditions.

LOCAL AND DISTANT MORPHOSYNTACTIC PROCESSING AT EARLY
STAGES OF SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION: AN EVENT-RELATED
POTENTIAL STUDY Kara Morgan-Short1, Laura Bartlett1, Mandy Faretta

Stutenberg1, Kay E. González-Vilbazo1; 1University of Illinois at Chicago — The

acquisition of morphosyntactic aspects of second languages (L2s) is
known to be particularly difficult for adult learners. The present study
extends research on the acquisition of L2 morphosyntactic processing
(e.g., Barber & Carreiras, 2005; Sabourin & Haverkort, 2003) by examining grammatical gender agreement between nouns and determiners
(local), attributive adjectives (local) and predicative adjectives (distant)
at different levels of L2 proficiency using event-related potentials (ERPs).
Subjects were English native speakers enrolled in university-level Spanish basic language classes and were split into two proficiency groups—
low and low-intermediate—based on the results of oral and written measures of proficiency. Subjects were asked to judge the acceptability of
visually-presented Spanish sentences containing grammatical gender
agreement violations on determiners and on attributive and predicative
adjectives, along with matched correct sentences, plus distractor sentences. ERP data was collected as subjects judged each sentence. Behavioral results indicated that learners' acceptability judgments were above
chance and that there were no differences between the low and lowintermediate groups. Preliminary analyses of the ERP results, however,
suggest that processing differences exist. Whereas there was no clear evidence of ERP effects typical of linguistic processing in the low group, the
low-intermediate group evidenced centro-parietal negativities for agreement on determiners and attributive adjectives, suggestive of N400
effects, although the effect was delayed for attributive adjectives. Predicative agreement elicited posterior positivities in low-intermediate
learners, suggestive of P600 effects. These findings imply that morphosyntactic gender agreement begins to be processed at low-intermediate,
not low, proficiency, despite a lack of behavioral differences between
groups.

H49
NEURAL MECHANISMS SUPPORTING IMPLICIT ACQUISITION OF
GRAMMAR IN A SECOND LANGUAGE Laura Batterink1, Helen Neville1;

1University of Oregon — Converging lines of evidence suggest that children
and adults rely upon different neural mechanisms for the acquisition of
grammatical information. While children acquiring their native grammar depend primarily on implicit memory systems, adults learning a
new grammar appear to rely more heavily upon explicit memory systems. However, one caveat to these observations is that language acquisition in adulthood typically occurs through explicit, intentional learning
strategies, as in a classroom setting. Surprisingly little attention has been
directed towards investigating the neural mechanisms involved in second language learning when exposure to grammatical structure is incidental, as in native language acquisition. To examine this question, we
presented adults with simple short stories in a foreign language, pairing
each sentence with an accompanying picture to illustrate meaning. Following exposure, subjects completed a surprise grammaticality judgment task to assess learning. Based on performance on the
grammaticality judgment task, subjects classified in the high proficiency
group showed a late positivity to violations in the foreign grammar, similar in latency and distribution to the P600 effect. In contrast, low proficiency subjects showed no reliable ERP violation effects. These results
suggest that adult learners who successfully acquire a foreign grammar
system after implicit exposure may recruit some of the language-processing mechanisms similar to those employed by native language

204

speakers. In line with previous findings, these mechanisms are primarily
controlled in nature, while more automatic parsing mechanisms appear
to be unavailable to adult second language learners, at least during early
stages of acquisition, even when learning is incidental.

EFFECTS OF TASK AND NARRATIVE CONTEXT ON SYNTACTIC
PROCESSING: AN ERP-FMRI STUDY Eric Pakulak1, Mark Dow1, Helen J.

Neville1; 1University of Oregon — Many neuroimaging studies of syntactic

processing use violation paradigms in which unrelated sentences are
presented in isolation, and many of these paradigms also require participants to make grammaticality judgments. Here we compared the neural
response to auditorily presented syntactic violations presented in unrelated sentences requiring a grammaticality judgment task (Grammaticality Judgment Condition; GJC) with the neural response to the same type
of violations when presented in a more ecologically valid context featuring narrative context and no task (Narrative Context Condition; NCC).
We acquired data from the same monolingual native English speakers in
the different task conditions in two complementary methodologies:
ERPs and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the ERP
paradigm, syntactic violations in both conditions elicited both an early
anterior negativity and a P600, though the P600 in the NCC was significantly reduced, consistent with some previous results (Gunter &
Friederici, 1999; Hahne & Friederici, 2002). In the fMRI paradigm, syntactic violations in both conditions elicited robust activation in left perisylvian language areas. In the GJC activation was more left-lateralized
and included more activation in parietal regions previously identified as
likely generators of the P600 (Pakulak, Dow, & Neville, 2009). In the
NCC activation was more bilateral in superior temporal regions and also
in regions consistent with previous neuroimaging evidence on coherent
text comprehension (Ferstl et al., 2008). The results suggest that processing syntactic violations recruits a core network of neural regions independent of task requirements, but that additional regions are recruited
under different task and context conditions.

SIMPLE BEAT GESTURES INFLUENCE THE SYNTACTIC ASPECT OF
LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION Henning Holle1, Jamie Ward1, Christian

Obermeier2, Maren Schmidt-Kassow3, Thomas Gunter2; 1University of Sussex,
Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, 3Goethe
University Frankfurt — Gestures are a pervasive phenomenon of human
2Max

communication and there is good evidence that these gestures convey
additional information not found in speech, but it is unclear whether
gestures and speech interact at the level of phonology, semantics or syntax. To date, the best evidence (derived from iconic gestures) suggests an
interaction at the semantic level. We designed an EEG experiment to test
whether beat gestures interact with the syntactic aspect of language.
Stimuli consisted of German sentences that were temporarily ambiguous
with respect to their syntactic structure (either Subject-Object-Verb SOV
or OSV). German speakers have a preference for SOV, and a disambiguation towards the less preferred OSV structure elicits increased processing costs, including an increased P600 component in the Event Related
Potential. In Experiment 1, we explored whether beat gestures can help
to disambiguate syntactically ambiguous sentences, by presenting sentences either without a beat gesture, with a beat on the first (NP1) or with
a beat on the second (NP2) ambiguous noun phrase. We found that a
beat on NP2 abolishes the P600 effect usually found for OSV structures,
suggesting that OSV structures become more plausible when the beat
highlights the subject of a sentence. In a control experiment, we paired
the auditory pitch accents resulting from making a beat with videos of a
non-gesturing speaker, and found that the auditory accent did not abolish the P600 effect. Thus, the beat gestures of a speaker, but not their
associated auditory pitch accents, interact with the syntactic aspect of
language.

native versus non-native language processing argue that native/nonnative differences result either from language proficiency, age of acquisition (AoA) or transfer from L1, but the relative impact of these and other
factors in bilingual language representation and processing are still not
well understood (Kotz 2009). In order to investigate these issues, we conducted a series of experiments in Basque language with native Basque
speakers and highly proficient Spanish/Basque bilinguals (AoA=3). The
experimental conditions were (i) linearization (verb-before-object (VO)
in Spanish and object-before-verb (OV) in Basque), (ii) verb agreement
(only with subject in Spanish, with subject and object in Basque) and (iii)
argument alignment (accusative in Spanish versus ergative in Basque).
Our results show that both groups behaved differently with regard to
(iii) ergative case, but similarly when dealing with (i) different linearizations (OV/VO) and with (ii) subject and object verb agreement violations. Spanish/Basque bilinguals displayed a smaller P600 component,
and more errors in the grammaticality judgment task for ergative case
compared to Basque/Spanish bilinguals. A similar ERP pattern and
comparable behavioral measures obtained for non-canonical wordorders (frontal negativities+P600) and verb agreement violations (N400P600) in both groups. These results indicate that some aspects of language-variation have a deeper impact in bilingual processing even at
high proficiency and early AoA, than others. Our findings suggest that
not all cross-linguistic differences are equivalent regarding bilingual
processing (McLaughin et al. 2010), an issue that is relevant to fully
understand the neural underpinnings of linguistic structure.

Related Potential (ERP) methodologies allow for the determination of
the relative independence of the neural activity which underlies stimulus feature processing. Using these methodologies we compared ERP
waveforms elicited by singly anomalous stimuli to those elicited by doubly anomalous stimuli. Applied to the linguistic domain, the ERP additivity index provides a measure of the degree to which grammatical
rules share similar or separate neural generators. We conducted two
experiments in which ERPs were recorded from native speakers of Italian as they read sentences containing article noun pairs. The article noun
pairs were well or ill formed with respect to agreement in either number
and phonology, or both, (experiment 1), or gender and number (experiment 2). Each of three singly anomalous stimuli and the two doubly
anomalous stimuli elicited a P600 deflection of the ERP waveform. Ill
formed article-noun pairs with respect to gender or phonology elicited a
P600 component with greater amplitude than those elicited by ones
anomalous with respect to number. In experiments 1 and 2, the waveforms resulting from double violations more closely resembled those
from phonology and gender single violations, respectively, than they did
those from number violations. The ERP additivity index describes the
percentage of overlap between the amplitudes of the waveforms elicited
by the doubly anomalous stimuli and those of the sums of singly anomalous stimuli, and hence, their relative neural independence.

NUMBER ATTRACTION EFFECTS ON OBJECT-CLITIC AGREEMENT IN
SPANISH: BEHAVIORAL AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE

Mikel Santesteban1, Adam Zawiszewski1, Erdocia Kepa1, Laka Itziar1;
1University of the Basque Country — Number attraction phenomenon in
subject-verb agreement relations has been widely studied in language
production and comprehension (e.g., Vigliocco, & Hartsuiker, 2002).
However, only two studies have explored the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects, and they have reported N400 and P600
components associated to the number attraction effects in subject-verb
agreement (Kaan, 2002; Severens & Hartsuiker, 2008). Here we explored
the electrophysiological responses of number attraction effects on objectclitic pronouns in Spanish. In a grammaticality judgment task, 46 Spanish native speakers were presented (word-by-word) with sentences containing a singular object-NP with a local noun that matched or
mismatched in number with the head noun. Sentences were either grammatical or ungrammatical, depending of whether they contained an
object-clitic pronoun that agreed or disagreed in number with the preceding object-NP (e.g., La pastora dijo que la casa de la(s) montaña(s) la/
*las visitó en invierno [The shepherdess said that the house in the mountain(s), she visited it/*them in winter]). Clear number attraction effects
were found. In the grammaticality judgment task, participants were significantly slower and less accurate in number mismatch than match conditions. More interestingly, at the critical word position (la vs. *las),
different ERP patterns related to grammaticality effects were reported
for number match (a fronto-central N400 followed by a P600) and mismatch (only a P600 component) conditions. The absence of N400 components in number mismatch conditions indicates that number attraction
effects have a deep impact on early (considered automatic) stages of
agreement computation, whereas later comprehension processes seem to
remain unaffected.

THE TIME COURSE OF FEATURE INTERFERENCE AND DECAY IN
AGREEMENT PROCESSING: EVIDENCE FROM EVENT-RELATED
POTENTIALS Darren Tanner1, Lee Osterhout1, Janet Nicol2; 1University of
Washington, 2University of Arizona — Language

processing in English
requires the agreement of grammatical number features between the
subject noun phrase (NP) and verb inflections. Behavioral studies have
shown that native English speakers have difficulty processing this agreement when the subject NP contains conflicting cues about grammatical
number (Nicol et al, 1997). Here we report results from two experiments
investigating the time course of grammatical number interference during
comprehension using event-related potentials. In Experiment 1 participants read sentences which contained a complex subject NP where the
two nouns either matched or mismatched in number feature, and which
contained a verb that either agreed or disagreed with subject (“The key
to the cabinet/cabinets is/*are very rusty”). Results show that the verb
in ungrammatical sentences elicited a P600 effect that was greater in the
match than mismatch conditions. Grammatical sentences showed a P600
effect for number mismatches, but only at the sentence-final word.
Experiment 2 used similar materials, but linearly separated the verb and
preceding noun with a sentential adverb, allowing the grammatical features of the local noun to decay before subject-verb agreement is processed. Results showed robust effects of ungrammaticality but no
interference from mismatching number features. These studies suggest a
working memory account of grammatical interference in agreement processing, where cue-based search works in tandem with predictive mechanisms for agreement checking at the verb (Wagers et al, 2009).
Mismatch interference occurs in grammatical sentences during sentencefinal wrap-up processes, not during agreement checking processes as
has previously been suggested (Pearlmutter, et al, 1999).

online sentence comprehension and what factors affect its retrieval? During ellipsis (the interpretation of unpronounced material), retrieval cues
at the ellipsis site may make direct contact with the antecedent in memory (Martin & McElree, 2008, 2009). To study this process, we examined
the electrophysiological response during retrieval of elided noun
phrases in Castilian Spanish. Tracking the online processing of ellipsis in
a language with morphological gender agreement allows the observation of retrieval as a function of the relevant representations (cues and
recently processed constituents). Participants read 4 sentence conditions
("Marta se compró la camiseta que estaba al lado de la falda/el vestido y
Miren cogió otra/*otro igual para salir de fiesta."), where the determiner
('otro'/'otra') cued the retrieval of the antecedent ('la camiseta'), which
occurred in the context of a matching or mismatching local agreement
attractor ('la falda'/'el vestido'). Data from 18 native speakers showed
ungrammatical sentences evoked a sustained anterior negativity compared to grammatical ones from 300 milliseconds onwards; this negativity was reduced in the context of a matching local agreement attractor.
Interestingly, in contrast to our predictions and inconsistent with ERP
results on agreement errors (Silva-Pereyra & Carreiras, 2007), no P600
effect was observed. However, consonant with ERP results on referential
processing (Van Berkum, Brown, & Hagoort, 1999), we take this anterior
negativity to reflect the degree of cue diagnosticity to linguistically relevant representations during retrieval in sentence comprehension.

stimulation (rTMS) and fMRI investigation of sentence comprehension
was conducted to assess changes in behavior and brain function following down regulation of Wernicke's area. Readers were found to have
improved performance on a language comprehension task following
rTMS to Wernicke’s area as compared to no change when the right hemisphere (RH) homologue received rTMS. This improved performance following left hemisphere rTMS was accompanied by an increase in
efficiency, resulting in reduced activation in a bilaterally distributed language comprehension network. This demonstrates adaptability of the
language network and suggests that the brain became more efficient due
to the focal down-regulation of Wernicke’s area. The brain activation
measures (fMRI) and behavioral performance (accuracy and speed of
responses to comprehension probes) were obtained as participants read
a set of cognitively demanding sentences , either a subject-relative construction (The doctor that sued the man retained an attorney.) or an
object-relative construction (The hippie that the drummer visited poured
the wine.). fMRI activation was acquired before, during and after rTMS
was applied to Wernicke’s area (the Left Superior Temporal Gyrus) in
the scanner. Behavioral data was also acquired outside the scanner when
rTMS was applied to the RH. The improvement in performance as a
result of this adaptive recruitment of cortex may indicate that rTMS actually led to a better processing strategy than the default strategy when the
typical mode of processing was not available. This offers a promising
new direction for the investigation of cognitive methods that enhance
performance.

HETEROGENEITY IN MODALITY-GENERAL AND MODALITY-SPECIFIC
RESPONSES TO INPUT-ORDER Samuel Nastase1, Vittorio Iacovella1, Uri

Hasson1; 1CIMeC - Center for Mind/Brain Sciences, University of Trento,
Italy — Prior work suggests that experience with monitoring auditory
transitions scaffolds order perception and that lateral temporal cortex
(Wernicke’s area) mediates a general order perception function. We
investigated whether regions associated with language comprehension

206

are sensitive to sequence-order (entropy) across different modalities.
Participants were presented with 8sec, 32-element series composed of
four tokens. Series were presented in three modalities: auditory, visual,
and audiovisual, and varied across four levels of order ranging from random to highly structured. Order was manipulated by varying the
entropy of a 1st-order Markov process. The proportion of self-repetitions
and relative token frequency (25%) were constant across levels of order.
Functional images were acquired using a 4 Tesla scanner and the hemodynamic response function was estimated for each condition in a fast
event-related design. A main effect of order, independent of modality,
was found in right anterior temporal (aTemp) and left anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC). Several regions showed interaction effects, indicating different sensitivity to order as a function of modality. Finally, response
profiles to levels of order varied across regions: a linear relation between
order and BOLD magnitude was found in ACC and aTemp, whereas lateral temporal regions exhibited U-shaped and inverse U-shaped
response profiles in the audiovisual modality but not in the auditory
modality. Our results demonstrate that order sensitivity is mediated by
domain-general and domain-specific systems, which show heterogeneous response profiles to levels of order. These findings provide little
support for the notion that lateral temporal regions perform a general
function of modality-independent order-coding.

BRAIN DYNAMICS OF COGNITIVE CONTROL DURING LEXICAL SELECTION
IN OVERT SPEECH Stephanie Ries1, Boris Burle1, F.-Xavier Alario1; 1CNRS
& Aix-Marseille Université — Lexical selection is the process by which we
select words for producing language. Neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging investigations have associated two frontal areas
with the control of this process: the left inferior frontal cortex and medial
frontal regions. Whether or not these regions play similar roles in word
selection remains unclear. We addressed this issue by studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of word selection in overt speech with spatially
improved electro-encephalography. We used a picture naming task
which included a semantic interference effect believed to reflect the competitive nature of lexical selection. With the same materials, we tested a
verbal version of the Simon task, involving arbitrary stimulus-response
associations. As early as 100 ms after stimulus presentation, left and
medial frontal activities were differentially affected by the task performed but not by within-task manipulations. These activities were
interpreted as alert signals to the structure that would later be involved
in the selection process. An activity starting 250/300 ms after stimulus
presentation could be specifically associated with lexical selection, in
agreement with recent findings. This activity was recorded over the left
frontal cortex and reached its maximum when the execution of the
response started. Finally, a medial frontal activity peaking about 250 ms
before vocal onset was present in both tasks and was associated with
response selection irrespective of the type of stimulus-response association. Together these findings suggest that word selection in overt speech
is under both specific and domain-general control mechanisms, differentially involving lateral and medial frontal regions.

sounds normally occurs in an automatic and effortless fashion. This is

We studied whether a multi-feature MMN paradigm, which contains
several parallel sound changes (deviants), using naturally produced
speech stimuli is feasible for studies of auditory discrimination accuracy
of adult, child and infant participants. A naturally produced trisyllabic

pseudo word [tatata] was used in the paradigm and MMNs were
recorded to changes that were acoustic (changes in fundamental frequency or intensity) or potentially phonological (changes in vowel identity or either vowel or consonant duration). All the different changes
were presented in three different word segments (initial, middle, or final
syllable) for adult participants or the middle position for child and infant
participants. All changes elicited an MMN response in adults and most
changes elicited responses in children but vowel duration change elicited a different response pattern than the other deviant types in adult
participants. Changes in vowel duration and identity also had an effect
on MMN lateralization in adult participants. Infants were only capable
of discriminating the changes after training. Our results show that
assessing speech sound discrimination of several features in word context is possible in a short recording time (30 minutes) with the multi-feature paradigm.

sounds (phonemes) with letters (graphemes). In individuals with reading impairments, such mapping is considered to be deficient. Recent
studies suggest that the integration of letters and speech sounds takes
place automatically and is dependent on temporal synchrony. In the
present studies, we examined the integration of written and heard syllables in 1) fluent adult readers and 2) compared them with dyslexic adult
readers. The mismatch negativity (MMN), an index of automatic change
detection in the brain, was recorded. Subjects were presented with consonant-vowel syllable sounds together with visual stimuli, which differed between conditions. The auditory stimuli included vowel or
consonant changes, or changes in syllable intensity, frequency, or vowel
duration. As visual material, written syllables or scrambled images of
the written syllables were used. The auditory stimuli were presented
either synchronously with the visual stimuli or with a time delay. 1) In
fluent readers, MMN amplitudes for consonant and frequency changes
were larger in the syllable than control condition, and time delay diminished the MMN for all deviants. Results suggested a modulation of
speech sound processing when sounds are presented with letters versus
non-linguistic visual stimuli, and further that letter-speech sound integration depends on temporal synchrony. 2) MMNs were smaller in dyslexic than fluent readers in the syllable but not the symbol condition.
MMNs of dyslexic readers were reduced by time delay and delayed for
simultaneously presented stimuli. Our results indicate a deficient and
delayed letter-speech sound integration in dyslexic individuals.

MMN RESPONSES IN ACQUIRED AND DEVELOPMENTAL APRAXIA OF
SPEECH: EVIDENCE FOR PHONOLOGICAL INVOLVEMENT Karen Froud1,
Reem Khamis-Dakwar2, Melissa Randazzo Wagner1; 1Teachers College,
Columbia University, 2Adelphi University — It is unknown to what extent

developmental childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) and acquired apraxia
of speech (AOS) may be associated with similar underlying mechanisms.
It has been suggested that AOS may be associated with overspecification
in the phonological domain (Dogil & Mayer, 1988; Dogil, Mayer, & Vollmer, 1996). Similarly some evidence suggests that children with CAS
have disordered phonological representations (e.g. Moriarty & Gillon,
2006). To evaluate this hypothesis, we investigated auditory MMN
responses from adults with AOS and children with CAS and healthy
age-matched controls. CV syllables were presented in passive-listening
oddball paradigms: phonemic (/ba/, /pa/), allophonic (/pa/, /pha/),
and nonspeech (FM sounds) contrasts. MMN was derived from highdensity EEG recordings by averaging and subtraction of averaged stan-

dard responses from averaged deviant responses within each condition.
For all participants, the nonspeech condition resulted in MMN enhancement to deviant presentations. In children, MMN enhancement was
observed in the phonemic contrast condition for controls only. The allophonic condition was not associated with MMN for children, but those
with CAS showed a positivity throughout the epoch (up to 400 msec),
which may index an immature pattern of responding (Rivera-Gaxiola,
Silva-Pereyra, & Kuhl, 2005). In adults with AOS, MMN enhancement
was evident in both the phonemic and allophonic conditions; however,
the MMN component showed a greater right-lateralized scalp distribution compared to controls, which likely indexes lesion-related functional
redistribution. We propose that these preliminary findings are consistent
with a view of CAS and AOS as disorders affecting underlying phonological representations.

FROM SOUND TO MEANING: CHANGES IN EEG SOURCE-LOCALIZED
BRAIN ACTIVITY WITH FOREIGN-LANGUAGE TRAINING Catherine

Poulsen1, Phan Luu1, Colin Davey1, Don Tucker1, Joey Nelson1; 1Electrical
Geodesics, Inc., Eugene, OR — When acquiring a foreign language, a
stream of initially unintelligible sounds slowly emerges into distinct
words and meaningful phrases. We aimed to track this process by measuring changes in brain activity across language training sessions.
Twenty native English speakers attended two 50-minute sessions of
computer-assisted, virtual-reality Dari language instruction, separated
by a day without instruction. Immediately before and after each training
session, subjects actively listened to 76 mini-dialogues while their electrical brain activity (EEG) was recorded from 256 scalp electrodes. Half the
dialogues were composed of phrases from the trained lesson, and half
were from an untrained lesson. Following each dialogue, subjects rated
their comprehension on a scale from 1 through 4. The EEG was averaged
off-line into event-related potentials (ERPs), time-locked to the onset of

head model was applied to localize the scalp ERPs to the cortical surface.
Training-specific changes in neural activity were observed in both articulatory-motor and semantic processing regions, including increases in left
posterior inferior temporal gyrus, left temporal pole, and left lateral inferior frontal regions for the trained words. Also observed, was increasing
left lateralization, and an increase in mediotemporal regions suggestive
of memory reconsolidation during the one-day break between training
sessions. These findings illustrate the ability to track changes with training in recognized language-processing brain regions using source-localized EEG recorded while listening to continuous, naturalistic speech.
Subsequent research will explore individual differences and the development of adaptive training based on neural indices.

COMPREHENDING ACTION VERBS WITH THE MOTOR SYSTEM Karen D.

I. Schuil1, Marion Smits2, Rolf A. Zwaan1; 1Erasmus University Rotterdam, The
of
Netherlands, 2Erasmus Medical Centre, The Netherlands — Theories
embodied cognition propose that higher order mental processes, such as
language, are fundamentally based on perceptual and motor processes.
More specifically, it has been hypothesized that the neural substrates for
processing verbs describing bodily actions show considerable overlap
with the neural substrates for performing the corresponding physical
actions. A competing view proposes that the language-induced activation of the neural substrates for action is modulated by context. Recent
studies have shown that action verbs in literal sentences activate the
motor system, while mixed results have been observed for action verbs
in idiomatic sentences. Thus, whether the recruitment of motor regions is
automatic or context dependent remains elusive. We investigated functional magnetic resonance imaging activation to idiomatic and literal
sentences including arm- and leg related actions. The Dutch language is
highly suitable for this purpose, because all of the context can be presented before the verb in the subordinate clause. After scanning, idiomatic sentence comprehension was tested. Our results show that action
verbs in both idiomatic and literal sentences recruit the fronto-temporal

regions, associated with language processing. Region of interest analyses
show that literal action verbs engage the motor regions to a greater
extent than idiomatic action verbs. Taken together, these results indicate
that during comprehension, the nature of the semantic context influences
the degree to which other modalities are recruited, such as in our case,
the motor regions.

EFFECTS OF SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION ON
LANGUAGE IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE Kaitlyn A. Litcofsky1, Lara

Hershcovitch2, Michael Pelster2, Matthew Gelfand1, P. David Charles2, Michael
T. Ullman1; 1Georgetown University, 2Vanderbilt University — While
deep
brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has become an
increasingly common therapy to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD) motor
symptoms, its effects on cognition, particularly on language, remain
unclear. Such effects may elucidate not only the nature of DBS, but also
the neural organization of language. This study investigates the effects of
DBS on tasks probing aspects of both language and motor function. Ten
early PD patients undergoing DBS treatment were compared to 10 early
PD patients on medication alone, and 24 healthy controls. All subjects
were tested twice; PD patients were tested first on and then off DBS or
medication. To assess language, subjects were asked to produce the pasttenses of regular and irregular verbs; evidence suggests that regular
past-tenses (and aspects of grammar more generally) depend on procedural memory and frontal/basal-ganglia circuits, and thus may be particularly affected by DBS. To assess motor function, subjects named
objects that are or are not commonly manipulated (e.g., hammer, elephant); evidence suggests that naming manipulated objects depends on
motor circuits, and thus should be especially affected by DBS. DBS, but
not medication alone, affected performance on both regular past-tenses
and manipulated objects, but in opposite directions. On-DBS yielded better performance at naming manipulated (but not non-manipulated)
objects than off-DBS. In contrast, on-DBS yielded worse performance at
producing regular (but not irregular) past-tenses than off-DBS. These
contrasting effects elucidate language outcomes that may be expected
from STN DBS, and the nature of motor and language circuits in the
basal-ganglia.

FOSTERING FLUENCY: TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION
IMPROVES FLUENCY IN SUBJECTS WITH CHRONIC NONFLUENT
APHASIA Catherine Norise1, Jared Medina2, H. Branch Coslett2, Roy

Hamilton2; 1Haverford College, 2University of Pennsylvania — Repetitive tran-

scranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) administered to the right inferior
frontal gyrus (IFG) has been shown induce improvements in naming
ability in patients with chronic left hemisphere stroke and nonfluent
aphasia. We previously reported (Hamilton et al., 2010) the case of single
patient in whom rTMS also led to improvements in spontaneous elicited
speech, a measure of fluency. We sought to elucidate whether similar
improvement in fluency can be induced in a larger cohort of patients
with chronic nonfluent aphasia. We report eight subjects who demonstrated deficits in fluency as assessed using the Cookie Theft picture
description task of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. In the
treatment condition, subjects received 1200 pulses of 1 Hz rTMS daily for
10 days at a site that had previously been shown to elicit a patientdependent optimal response to rTMS. They were then tested one day
and two months after treatment. In the sham condition, a subset of these
subjects was tested on the same protocol with sham instead of real TMS.
For measures of fluency, including the usage of closed-class words and
speech rate, subjects improved in picture description 2 months after
rTMS. However, these improvements were not observed in the sham
stimulation condition. The results suggest that rTMS of the right IFG of
patients with chronic non-fluent aphasia may improve language fluency,
and that these benefits may persist after discontinuation of TMS treatment.

CASE-INVARIANT LETTER REPRESENTATIONS REVEALED THROUGH
MULTI-VOXEL SIMILARITY ANALYSIS David Rothlein1, Brenda Rapp1;
1Johns Hopkins University — Literate

adults effortlessly recognize that r
and R refer to the same letter. A common explanation is to assume a representational level that encodes a letter’s abstract letter identity (ALI) in
a manner that is case and font-invariant. Previous fMRI studies have
investigated case-invariance by identifying regions exhibiting cross-case
word priming (e.g. dog facilitating DOG) (Dehaene et al., 2001; 2004), or
by comparing brain responses for alternating and single-case words (e.g.
OrAnGe vs. orange) (Polk and Farah, 2002). Their findings indicated
case-invariant responses in the left mid-fusiform gyrus. However, since
the alphabetic stimuli used in these studies consisted of words and
pseudowords, these studies did not directly test for ALIs. We addressed
this in an fMRI study in which participants viewed single letters in an
event-related design. For data analysis we used a multivariate representational similarity approach (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008). Specifically, we
assumed that regions encoding ALIs should show greater similarity in
their activation patterns for identical (yet visually dissimilar) cross-case
pairs (a and A) than for non-identical cross-case pairs (a and B). Analyses
revealed clusters of voxels in the left mid-fusiform gyrus and the left
IFG/IFJ that showed greater similarity in their response patterns for
identical cross-case letter pairs than for non-identical pairs. These results
provide both a more nuanced understanding of ALIs in the left mid-fusiform gyrus and converging evidence for the importance of this region
and the left IFG/IFJ in the literate brain (Rapp and Lipka, 2010).

Grenoble, France — The present study aims to assess the effect of gender

and handedness on the hemispheric lateralization patterns in healthy
subjects during phonological (phoneme detection, PD) and semantic (living categorization, LC) processing, compared to a visuo-attentional control (C) task. Twenty four healthy volunteers participated at the
experiment, 12 were right-handed (half females) and 12 left-handed (half
females). Experimental conditions were implemented into a pseudo-randomized event-related fMRI paradigm. Two separate scans have been
measured, one for PD and another one for LC. A 3T MR scanner (Bruker
MedSpec S300) has been used for MR acquisitions. After fMRI spatial
pre-processing steps, individual statistical analyses have been performed first (PD vs C; LC vs. C). Subsequently, a random-effect group
analysis using one-sample t-test was performed for the same contrasts (p
< .001, k = 20, T = 3.50). Based on the activation resulting from the group
analysis, we defined symmetrical (left/right) regions of interest (ROI).
For each task, each subject and each ROI, the % of MR signal intensity
variation has been extracted and included in two ANOVA analyses one
for each task (Gender and Handedness were between-subject factors and
Hemisphere was within-subject factor). Our results showed left hemisphere predominance for both tasks. The effect of gender and handedness was observed only for PD. Specifically, left-handed females were
not hemisphere lateralized. This result suggests that several variables
may affect the hemispheric specialization for language

ON THE ROLE OF CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION IN THE NEURAL

GRANGER ANALYSIS OF MULTIMODAL IMAGING DATA David Gow1,2,3,

Ricky Sachdeva1; 1Massachusetts General Hospital, 2Athinoula A. Martinos
Center for Biomedical Imaging, 3Salem State University — For over 50 years,
evidence for the categorical perception of speech sounds (CP) has created a disconnection between the study of speech perception and the
study of word recognition. The goal of the current study is to use 40 Hz
phase locking and Granger analysis of high spatiotemporal resolution
MRI-constrained MEG/EEG movies to identify the networks and network dynamics that support CP, and to determine what role if any these
play in word recognition. Two experiments are presented. The first
involves the explicit categorization of synthetic place and voicing continua in CV contexts. The second employs a word-picture matching task
using CV and CVC continua that draw on the same continua. In the
explicit categorization task causal interactions between the left superior
temporal sulcus (STS) and the angular gyrus (AG) are found for tokens
that straddle phonetic categories. In the word-picture matching task
tokens with the same phonetic characteristics did not engage the STS or
AG, but instead engaged strong bidirectional interactions between the
supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. We will review converging evidence from BOLD imaging and correlations between vocabulary development and grey matter neuronal density suggest that the
SMG stores abstract representations of wordform. These results imply
that: (1) the networks and processes that produce CP in explicit categorization tasks do not play a major role in word recognition and (2) word
recognition involves an interactive direct mapping between sound and
wordform.

ERP EFFECTS OF PUNCTUATION: EVIDENCE FROM EVENT-RELATED

Valeriote1, Karsten Steinhauer1; 1McGill University, 2Stony Brook University —

This study used ERPs to investigate the real-time use of punctuation in
processing ambiguous sentence structures. Previous ERP work in German suggested that commas activate implicit prosodic boundaries that
locally elicit the closure positive shift (CPS) and help disambiguate syntactic structures in the same way as overt prosodic boundaries in speech
(Steinhauer & Friederici, 2001). However, since this notion remains controversial (Kerkhofs et al, 2008), the present study was designed to contribute cross-linguistic evidence from a variety of English structures.
Twenty-eight participants read sentences that were ambiguous either
between (a) parenthetical (1) and subordinate clause (2) readings or (b)
between early closure (3) and late closure (4) structures, and that either
contained commas or not. (1) Mary(,) said John(,) was the nicest girl. (2)
John(,) said Mary(,) was the nicest girl. (3) Since Jay always jogs(,) a mile
seems a short distance to him. (4) Since Jay always jogs(,) a mile, this
seems a short distance to him. ERP data revealed the following significant effects: (A) CPS components were elicited at all comma positions.
(B) Incongruent comma use in (1) and (2) resulted in N400 effects on the
critical noun phrase (‘girl’). (C) Replicating a recent auditory ERP study,
we found prosody-driven garden path effects in (3) and (4), the strength
of which depended on whether commas had to be mentally deleted or
inserted. These data provide further support for the direct correspondence of (punctuation-driven) implicit and overt prosody and for the
Boundary Deletion Hypothesis (Pauker et al., in press).

sions of the left STS. Analysis of these connectivity maps suggests a
subdivision of the STS into 3 main functional groups: 1) a semantic
group including cortex in the angular gyrus, anterior temporal lobe, and
lower bank of the mid-STS; (2) a posterior temporal group involved in
speech production, with connections to the posterior superior temporal
plane, supramarginal gyrus, and posterior inferior frontal cortex; and (3)
an upper bank group in the mid-STS with connections to the superior
temporal plane, parietal operculum, and primary sensory-motor cortex,
likely involved in speech perception and monitoring speech production.
Functional connectivity with ventral visual areas was confined to one
lower bank region in the posterior temporal STS. In addition to connections with the semantic system, anterior temporal regions showed widespread connectivity with frontal opercular, sensory-motor, and medial
temporal cortex, suggesting a "hub" role in integrating and encoding
diverse sources of information. Consistent with studies of the monkey
STS, marked differences in connectivity were observed between upper
and lower bank regions in the mid-portion of the sulcus. These data provide new evidence on the functional organization of the human STS and
illustrate a powerful method of functional parcellation that can be
applied to other large, functionally heterogeneous regions.

Medical Center — Objective: To evaluate patterns of cerebral dominance
for language in children with autism spectrum disorders. Participants
and Methods: Magnetoencephalography was used to evaluate cerebral
dominance in thirty-six children with an autism spectrum disorder and
23 neurotypical children. Whole-head MEG data were recorded during a
dichotic listening paradigm. On each trial of the paradigm, the subject
was presented a pair of words, one to each ear. Word pairs were semantically related [e.g., hot/cold, day/night] or unrelated [e.g., hot/moon,
earth/sad], and subjects were instructed to listen to the words. The critical MEG response occurs between 350 and 750 milliseconds, post-stimulus, with the side of greatest response being language dominant as
previously validated in 33 of 35 neurosurgical patients that underwent
sodium amytal (Wada) testing. Results: Most neurotypical children
showed the expected pattern of left hemisphere dominance [83%]. 13%
of neurotypical children showed bilateral profiles and 4% were right
hemisphere dominant. In marked contrast, only 23% of children with an
ASD were left hemisphere dominant for language77% of children with
ASD showed right (46%) or bilateral (31%) dominance, whereas 83% of
the neurotypical controls showed left dominance, 13% showed bilateral
and 4% showed right dominance. Conclusion: The data indicate that
children with ASDs show anomalous profiles of langauge dominance.
This may have important implications for directing neuromodulatory
strategies [transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation] that are being explored to improve language skills.

rate corresponded to increased activation in the left cingulate gyrus and

readers revealed that the left inferior parietal lobule was recruited by
adult readers but not by adolescent readers. Neural correlates of fluent

the code switching between the two languages are enabled in the bilingual brain are intensively investigated in recent literature. The present
study aimed to reveal the temporal dynamics of the code-switching
effect between one alphabetic and one logographic language with the
priming paradigm in 20 unbalanced Chinese-English bilinguals. A prime
in one of three languages (Chinese, English or Korean) appeared for
100ms, and a target word in either Chinese or English was presented for
participants to make a semantic judgment. Event-related potentials
(ERPs) elicited by the target following a same-language, different-language, or non-linguistic prime (i.e., Korean) were recorded via a 64channel electrophotography. Regardless the target language, only
English primes that are visually distinct from participants’ native language elicited a stronger N1 component of the target, while only Korean
primes that are non-linguistic to participants elicited a stronger N2 component of the target. The code-switching effect was revealed from 250 ms
after the target onset, as a prime in the same language with the target
elicited a smaller P3 component than the other two kinds of primes. The
prime in the same language with the target, as well as the nonlinguistic
prime, was also associated with a smaller N400 component of the target
than the prime in a different language. The neurophysiological findings
suggested that the effect of code-switching between alphabetic and logo-

Xu1, Allen Braun1; 1National Institutes of Health, National Institute on
Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, 2Howard Hughes Medical
Institute — An ecologically valid model of discourse-level language production must account for a speaker’s ability to spontaneously generate
novel utterances in complex social contexts. To identify the neural basis
underlying these processes, we collected blood oxygen level-dependent
functional magnetic resonance images while subjects produced different
types of narrative: rehearsed fictional stories, improvised fictional stories, and autobiographical stories. Stories included either one character
or more than one. As a control, subjects recited nursery rhymes. Brain
activity during production of rehearsed stories (compared to nursery
rhymes) demonstrated strongly left lateralized activation of classical language areas and extrasylvian areas recruited at the discourse level. Conversely, improvised fictional narratives (compared to rehearsed stories)
revealed bilateral activity which was most pronounced in the medial
prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortices and inferior
parietal lobules – the so-called default-mode network (DMN). Improvisational fiction involving social interaction (two vs. one characters) was
associated with selective increases in the posterior portions of the DMN.
The patterns associated with autobiographical narratives were strikingly
similar to those seen for improvisational fiction, differing only in that
they more robustly activated the left parahippocampal gyrus. Our
results illustrate unique patterns of brain activity during production of
different types of narrative. Importantly, the DMN appears to be selectively activated when subjects produce either improvised fictional stories or autobiographical narratives. Furthermore, we demonstrate
enhanced activity of the posterior regions of the DMN during improvisational production of fiction involving more than a single character, suggesting a possible role for these regions in creating representations
depicting social interactions.

tests by which aphasia is assessed—the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB),
Psycholinguistic Assessments of Language Processing in Aphasia
(PALPA), etc—rely on assessing linguistic ability on lexical and sentential levels, though recovered aphasics are anecdotally troubled by difficulties at the discourse level. This study compared the performance of 21

discourse, story generation, story retelling and story comprehension.
Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Controls performed at

impaired relative to controls despite their strong performance on tests
that are considered standard measures of language ability. Overall, production was more significantly impaired than comprehension. Additionally, results show no correlation between performance on the standard

Behaviour, Centre for Cognition, Radboud University Nijmegen, The
Netherlands — Language problems are among the most profound deficits
in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Individuals with ASD often show
increased performance on low level tasks, whereas high level processing
seems reduced. Leading theories ascribe these language atypicalities to
superior perceptual functioning (e.g. Frith, 1989; Mottron & Burack,
2001). Alternatively, as we propose, language problems might not result
from language (in)competency as such, but from a different interaction
between attention and language. The goal of the present study was to
investigate the role of attention during processing of different levels of
language. A dual-task experiment was designed, in which participants
were exposed to sentences in three different conditions: I) a low level
condition with attentional focus on orthographic errors, II) a high level
condition with attentional focus on syntactic errors, and III) a dual level
condition with attentional focus on both orthographic and syntactic
errors. Reaction times for error detection were measured from 16 highfunctioning adults with autism, and 16 IQ- and age-matched controls.
Repeated measures analyses were conducted to compare performance in
the dual level and the single level conditions. For controls, as expected,
there was an attentional cost of dual level processing for low level performance but not for high level performance. For ASD participants, however, there was an attentional cost both for low level and for high level
performance, as shown by significant increases in reaction times. These
results suggest a strategic use of attention during language processing in
ASD, rather than a difference in ability to process language.

3The Graduate Center, CUNY — Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) present as a heterogeneous group, with underlying deficits in
communication, social relatedness, restricted and repetitive behaviors,
and sensory sensitivities. Studies of children with ASD suggest that deficits in these areas may be characterized as difficulty with “complexities”,
where performance on tasks requiring simple processing is spared,
while performance on more complex tasks may show deficits. Hence,
ASD children seem to be superior in processing fine visual detail but
poorer in processing global structure. This study assessed visual eventrelated potentials of 6 non-verbal children with ASD and age-matched
controls (mean age = 5.6 years) to photographs of common objects followed 500ms later by a matched or mismatched verbal label (e.g., picture
of book followed by the word “book” or “duck”). Results suggest group
differences in the latency of the first positive peak, C1. For children with
ASD, the C1 peaked at approximately 200ms (maximal at occipital areas)
compared to 150 ms for controls. No group differences in amplitude
were seen, however, controls also showed a robust second positive peak,
a P1 (350ms), which was missing in the ASD group. While C1 is thought
to index sensory processing, P1 has a top-down component and is
affected by attention shifting and focus. These findings are consistent
with prior literature suggesting that children with ASD, while showing
relatively intact sensory processing, may have disrupted complex processing abilities. Furthermore they may have difficulty focusing on, and

tory signals in the millisecond range is related to differences in language
acquisition. Early deficits in RAP are predictive of later language disorders, such as Specific Language Impairment and dyslexia. In this study,
we evaluate changes in the morphology of high density scalp eventrelated potentials (ERPs) from 14 typically developing 7-month-old
infants before and after completing a computerized training task
designed to sharpen auditory discrimination abilities. ERPs were passively elicited in an oddball paradigm (standard stimulus = 800-800Hz
tone pair [85%]; deviant = 800-1200Hz) using fast- and slow-rate complex tone-pairs. ERPs were assessed at pretest (4-months) and then after
completing a 6-week active training program (7-months). ERPs from the
experimental group were compared to age-matched naïve controls
(n=10). Preliminary analysis showed a P100-N200-P300 complex to standard and deviant waveforms, and a mismatch response (MMR) from the
difference waveform (deviant-standard), at 4- and 7-months in both
groups. There were no group differences in latency/amplitude at pretest. At posttest, however, latencies for the P100-N200-P300 complex for
fast-rate stimuli were shorter as compared to pretest, and the N200
appeared significantly earlier in the experimental group as compared to
controls (standard: 260 versus 330 ms, deviant: 250 ms versus 280ms). In
previous studies, individual differences in N200 latencies were robustly
associated with later language outcomes. The experimental group
showed additional negative components not typically observed until 12
months-of-age. Findings suggest that early auditory training may accelerate efficient auditory processing abilities in infants.

phonological or visuo-magnocellular deficits. Here, we report a novel
technique to simulate dyslexic symptoms in normal readers during
visual lexical word-pseudoword decisions, and the underlying neurofunctional mechanisms. Grapheme-to-phoneme mapping was impaired
by manipulating the identifiability of letters via familiar or unfamiliar
letter shapes. Visuo-magnocellular processing was impaired by presenting letters in a moving, non-stationary manner. Lexical decision times
were systematically higher for both types of simulation, which did not
interact. Pseudowords elicited higher reaction times than words in all
simulations, thus implying that the lexical advantage for words was
maintained despite increasing processing difficulty. Moreover,
pseudoword processing was extra difficult in the phonological simulation, as indicated by a significant interaction of word-type and letter
shape. The simulation replicates earlier findings in the literature on “real
dyslexics”. Using fMRI, the phonological simulation recruited predominantly left and right IFG, whereas the magnocellular simulation
involved bilateral V5/MT+. These findings demonstrate that dyslexic
reading may be caused by phonological vs. magnocellular deficits with
distinct neural pathways. The experimental simulation may help testing
novel hypotheses about dyslexia first with normal readers as “models”
before recruiting dyslexic participants only for the final examinations.

France — This study aims to assess the plasticity of language before (BS)
and after surgery (AS) in a right-handed 55y old female patient with left
temporal epilepsy. The neuropsychological assessment showed BS phonological fluency impairment (Cardebat et al., 1990) (Standard Deviation
SD = -1.93) which was improved AS (SD = +.18). The fMRI examination
explored three tasks (phonological, semantic and prosodic). Based on the
activation obtained in control, specific task-related regions of interest
were defined. Modified t-test analyses (Crawford & Howell, 1998)
allowed the comparison of the mean parameter estimates between
patient and control group. Compared to control, the results for phonological task showed deficit of activation BS, within Broca’s area and left
lingual gyrus and additional activation of right superior temporal and
left supramarginal gyri as well as of bilateral precuneus. Compared to
BS, additional activation of left middle temporal (around the excised
region), fusiform, lingual, occipital inferior, supramarginal gyri and
bilateral precuneus, has been revealed AS. BS and AS, the performance
during phonological fMRI task was above the chance level. Moreover,
the performance was significantly higher AS than BS. BS, the temporal
epileptic focus induced cerebral reorganization of phonological substrate
(illustrated by homologue activation of Wernicke’s area). However, this
plasticity pattern was functionally insufficient as the patient had phonological deficits. AS, another pattern of reorganization was described with
supplementary activation of ipsilateral (to surgery) language and visuoattentional regions. This pattern was functional because it was associated
with improvement of phonological abilities.

CROSS-LANGUAGE NEIGHBORHOOD DENSITY EFFECTS IN LATE
ENGLISH-WELSH BILINGUALS: AN ERP STUDY Giordana Grossi1, Nicola

Savill2, Enlli Thomas2,3, Guillaume Thierry2,3; 1State University of New York,
New Paltz, 2Bangor University, 3Centre for Research on Bilingualism in Theory
and Practice, Bangor University — Behavioral studies with proficient late

bilinguals have revealed the existence of orthographic neighborhood
density effects across languages for both the first (L1) and the second
(L2) language (e.g., van Heuven et al., 1998). Electrophysiological evidence for cross-language activation comes from Midgley et al. (2008)
who found an enhanced N400 for words with many cross-language
neighbors compared to words with few cross-language neighbors. The
authors also found an early effect (175-275 ms) only for L2 words, which
they explained in terms of differential connection strength between L1
and L2 words depending on frequency of exposure (higher for L1). In
this study, 14 late English-Welsh bilinguals performed a semantic categorization task on English and Welsh words presented in separate
blocks. Words in the two languages were matched on orthographic and
lexical measures. Fifty percent of words in each language had many
cross-language neighbors and 50% had few cross-language neighbors.
Similar early ERP cross-language neighborhood density effects (175-300
ms) were found for both L1 and L2 words, suggesting similar orthographic activation mechanisms for the two languages in proficient late
bilinguals. In contrast, significant cross-language neighborhood density
effects in the 300-600 ms were observed only for L1 words. These findings support the non-selective access view of single word recognition, at
least in terms of orthographic processing, and suggest that proficiency
with a language is what shapes the development of cognitive and neural
orthographic processes.

A BEHAVIORAL INVESTIGATION OF THE ROLE OF NON-ADJACENT LETTER
BIGRAMS IN LETTER IDENTIFICATION Brenna Fearey1, Nolan Conaway1,

Denise Donatien-Coder1, Jesse Siegel1, Viviana Quinones1, Giordana Grossi1;
1State University of New York at New Paltz — According to some theories,
word recognition involves the activation of both adjacent and non-adjacent letter bigrams. Evidence mainly hinges on masked priming experiments. We sought to more directly test these models by investigating the
role of non-adjacent letter bigrams in letter recognition. Adjacent letter
bigram frequency and non-adjacent letter bigram frequency were
orthogonally manipulated in a series of forced-choice letter identification
experiments. Four types of stimuli were developed: nonwords with low
adjacent and low non-adjacent bigram frequency (e.g., JBRWO), nonwords with low adjacent and high non-adjacent bigram frequency (e.g.,
DBRWY), pseudowords with high adjacent and low non-adjacent bigram frequency (e.g., JURSO), and pseudowords with high adjacent and
high non-adjacent bigram frequency (e.g., DURSY). In the first experiment, letters in the central position were identified more accurately
when embedded in pseudowords than nonwords (pseudoword superiority effect, PSE). Furthermore, the PSE increased for stimuli with high
non-adjacent bigram frequency. These results were replicated in a second experiment where we controlled for the masking effect of the central
fixation point. A third study was conducted in order to control for the
pronounceability of the nonwords. We replicated the PSE, but the previously observed interaction between the two types of bigram frequency
disappeared. These results suggest that the bigram frequency of adjacent
letters strongly impacts letter identification, whereas the bigram frequency of non-adjacent letters may not. We are currently investigating
whether phonology modulates these orthographic effects.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL REPRESENTATION OF ACTION VERBS IN THE
FIRST LANGUAGE AND THE SECOND LANGUAGE ON THE PRIMARY
MOTOR CORTEX Sungbong Kim1, Peter Gordon1; 1Teachers College,
Columbia University — This study investigated cortical electrophysiological responses to visually presented different types of words (action verbs
and abstract words) and different types of action verbs (Face-, Hand-,
and Foot-related verbs) to examine how action verbs from both the first
language (L1: Korean) and the second language (L2: English) are represented on primary motor area of cortex (PMA) by comparing cortical
event-related potentials (ERPs). A 128-channel electroencephalography
system collected scalp voltages of five native Korean adults at 250Hz
rate. The mean amplitudes of ERPs at the three early time-windows
(90~160ms(N1), 160~230ms(P2), and 230~300ms(P3)) were computed to
test word type effect at PMA montage, and effect of action verbs on the
four selected electrodes of left PMA (Cz, C1, C3, and C5). Larger P2 for
action verbs than abstract words (1.483 vs. 0.692) was observed at PMA,
F(1, 4)=5.100, p=.087. Within L2 condition, verb type effect was observed
in the first time window, F(2, 8)=3.598, e=.798, p=.095. Further analysis
with individual electrodes revealed that foot-related words elicited significantly bigger N1 than face-related words at the two electrodes, Cz
and C1, which locate above leg-movement cortical area of motor homunculus, F(1, 4)=16.452, p<.05, and F(1, 4)=7.328, p=.054, respectively. L2
words had consistently larger amplitude than L1 words. The results of
current study found the effect of word types and the effect of verb types,
and confirm the claim of distributed semantic processing of brain and
neural level ground of action verbs, though this conclusion was more
obvious with ERPs for L2 comparing to L1.

longitudinal predictor of reading ability beyond behavioral measures
across languages. However, it remains unclear which reading-related
processes (phonological awareness, accuracy, fluency) are concurrently
related to the MMN. In this study, children ages 5-8 heard natural speech
syllables /ba/ and /da/ through earphones while attending to a silent
cartoon during EEG recording. All participants had typical language and
hearing, and nonverbal IQ and vocabulary standard scores above 90. We
analyzed event-related potentials for 3,000 trials (10% deviants) and calculated the mean amplitude of the difference between standard and
deviant trials 200-500msec after stimulus onset. Analyses revealed that
the mean amplitude of individuals’ MMN response was significantly
related to standardized measures of reading fluency at the connected
text, word, and subword levels (WJ-III Tests of Achievement Reading
Fluency, Test of Word Reading Efficiency, Rapid Automatized Naming),
but not to other measures of untimed reading or phonological awareness. The higher-amplitude mismatch response to deviant stimuli might
reflect automaticity of processing that is required for fluent reading.
These findings support the notion that cognitive neuroscience techniques could be useful in efforts to identify children who will have reading difficulties, especially in the crucial domain of fluency, which is often
overlooked in assessments of reading ability.

NEURAL SENSITIVITY TO SUB-PHONEMIC FEATURES: AN FMRI
ADAPTATION STUDY Laurel A. Lawyer1, Lewis C. Lawyer1, David P. Corina1;
1University of California Davis — Goal.

fMRI adaptation paradigms have
been commonly used to explore the featural composition of visual processing in humans (Grill-Spector and Malach (2001)). In auditory perception, speech sounds may also be composed of hierarchical featural
representations. However, the methods of fMRI adaptation have not
been widely applied to speech processing. Methods. This study uses
adaptation effects to investigate featural differentiation of English CV
syllables. Subjects (n=7) listened to a single syllable repeated 8-14 times,
followed by a test item which differed in 0-3 phonetic features (as
defined by Hayes (2009)). A region of interest analysis was used to
define voxels that were sensitive to speech compared to noise (Marsbar,
Brett et al. (2002)). Data was analyzed both on a group level using standard SPM methods, and on an individual level using a time-course sensitive pattern classification algorithm (TClass, Kadous (2002)). Results.
Initial results show differential activation for test items based on the
degree of feature similarity to preceding adaptation strings. The temporal pattern classification technique demonstrates the ability to reliably
classify these neural responses based on auditory form. Conclusion.
These data suggest that regions in auditory cortex are sensitive to featural content of speech below the level of the segment. This level of
encoding may represent articulatory or acoustic features in speech.

ICONIC GESTURES FACILITATE WORD AND MESSAGE PROCESSING

Ying Choon Wu1, Marguerite McQuire1, Seana Coulson2; 1Center for Research
in Language, UCSD, 2Department of Cognitive Science, UCSD — This study
assessed how iconic gestures impact the brain’s real-time response both
to speech in spontaneous, multi-modal discourse about concrete topics,
and to pictures of the objects discussed. EEG was recorded as 24 healthy
adults viewed descriptive discourse involving both speech and iconic
gestures. Videos were followed by related or unrelated picture probes.
Incongruent control trials were constructed by swapping audio and
video files such that gestures no longer matched the meaning of utterances. After EEG recording, participants classified the speech-gesture
congruency of each trial offline, and were divided into two groups based
on their performance: super-integrators, who tended to judge most videos as congruent, and conservative integrators, who exhibited a bias
towards incongruent judgments. Overall, ERPs time-locked to speech in
the videos were less negative 400-875 ms when accompanied by congruent versus incongruent gestures. In conservative integrators, the congruency effect had a posterior topography, not unlike that of the wellknown N400 effect. In super-integrators, congruency effects were fron-

tally focussed, consistent with ERP concreteness effects. In both groups,
brain response to related picture probes differed from unrelated, suggesting a facilitative effect of discourse. However, ERPs to picture probes
revealed that only the super-integrators were sensitive to the speech-gesture congruency in the discourse prime. Findings suggest that superintegrators engaged image-based processes to construct a representation
of speaker meaning that combined information from both his words and
gestures. Conservative integrators utilized congruent gestures to facilitate semantic processing of concurrent speech, but do not appear to have
engaged imagistic processes.

LISTENERS DIRECT ATTENTION TO UNPREDICTABLE MOMENTS IN
CONTINUOUS SPEECH: EVIDENCE FROM EARLY LATENCY EVENTRELATED POTENTIALS Lori Astheimer1, Lisa Sanders1; 1University of
Massachusetts Amherst — Several lines of research demonstrate that listeners attend to word onsets in continuous speech, but the reason for this
preferential processing is unknown. Attending to all word onsets may be
necessary for word recognition, or listeners may attend to the initial portions of most words because these segments cannot be predicted from
context. To test the hypothesis that predictability modulates attention
during speech processing, we compared event-related potentials (ERPs)
elicited by attention probes presented concurrently with word onsets following highly constraining (e.g., The woman took the warm cake out of
the …) and unconstraining (e.g., The man walked over to the …) contexts. The completion of both sentences was a word that, based on the
constraining context, was either expected (e.g., oven) or unexpected (e.g.,
pantry). Each participant heard both contexts with only one completion
for each to avoid repeating items and to balance all other factors across
participants. Probes presented concurrently with word onsets in unconstraining sentences elicited a larger first negative peak (N1) than the
same words in constraining sentences. As expected, unpredictable
words in constraining contexts and both types of words in the unconstraining contexts elicited a larger N400 than predictable words in constraining contexts. These results indicate that listeners direct more
attention, as indexed by N1 amplitude, to word onsets that cannot be
predicted from the preceding context. Unexpected words capture processing resources later, as indexed by the N400. This suggests that temporally selective attention is used to preferentially process the most
informative segments of speech.

SEMANTIC AND PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSING IN THE VISUOSPATIAL
DOMAIN: EVIDENCE FROM SWEDISH SIGN LANGUAGE Eleni

Disability Research, Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning,
Linköping University, Sweden — Signed language (SL) processing (phonological, semantic) is supported by classical left-hemisphere areas that
support spoken language processing (Rönnberg et al., 2000). Previous
work has been unable to distinguish experimentally the neural correlates
of semantic and phonological SL processing, however. In the present
experiment we isolate phonological and semantic processing in a single
fMRI study by manipulating the semantic and phonological characteristics of the stimulus material. 11 native signers of Swedish Sign Language
(SSL) were scanned while performing monitoring tasks for specific components of (a) familiar SSL signs (phonology and semantics), (b) foreign
signs from British Sign Language (BSL) (phonology only), and (c) nonsigns (non-existing signs violating phonological rules; neither phonology
nor semantics). Preliminary analyses reveal greater activation for SSL
signs compared to BSL signs (semantic processing) in frontal (left superior MFG, IFG bilaterally but mainly on the left, SFG) and temporal areas

(left superior and middle temporal pole, inferior temporal gyrus, left
MTG and angular gyrus). Contrasting activation for BSL signs and nonsigns (phonological processing) reveals activations in left IFG, the preand postcentral gyri, MFG and insula bilaterally, middle cingulate, right
putamen and right supramarginal gyrus (bilaterally, more pronounced
on the left). These results indicate that semantic and phonological processing in SL are supported by distinct yet overlapping networks that at
least partly match those suggested for spoken language processing. In
the first neurolinguistic endeavour to explore SLs crosslinguistically,
data from native BSL signers will be collected and analysed to establish
the cross-linguistic generality of these results.

LISTENING TO INTELLIGIBLE BUT DEGRADED SPEECH INCREASES THE
STRENGTH OF FEED FORWARD AND FEED BACKWARD CONNECTIONS

SULCUS Samuel Evans1, Carolyn McGettigan1, Alex P Leff1, Stuart Rosen1,
Zarinah K Agnew1, Poonam Shah1, Sophie K Scott1; 1University College
London — Studies in human and non-human primates suggest that audi-

tory information is processed hierarchically, with regions lateral to primary auditory cortex responding selectively to stimuli of increasing
complexity. Accurate speech perception requires the integration of lower
level, acoustic processes with higher-order, linguistic processes, with the
demands increased on this system when individuals listen to degraded
speech. We wanted to understand how the effective connectivity within
the temporal lobes was modulated by listening to degraded but intelligible speech. In this study we demonstrate with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) that
listening to degraded speech increases the strength of both feed forward
and feed backward connections between left anterior and left posterior
STS. Furthermore, we show that stimulus-dependent activity within the
left hemisphere causes dynamic changes in activity within the right
hemisphere, but not vice versa. These results suggest that the left anterior STS, a region previously implicated in the processing of intelligible
speech, may be involved in top down modulation of left posterior STS
when individuals listen to degraded speech signals. Furthermore the
results provide an alternative approach in demonstrating left hemisphere dominance in language processing.

THE EFFECT OF VARIED PROPORTIONS OF WORD TYPES IN A READING
TASK ON FMRI BOLD ACTIVATION IN THE VENTRAL AND DORSAL VISUAL
PROCESSING STREAM Crystal Zhou1, Brea Chouinard1, Stan Hrybouski1,
Jacqueline Cummine1; 1University of Alberta — Background: Two processing

streams are associated with reading tasks: a dorsal route employing
serial reading and a ventral route involved in whole-word reading. The
extent to which each stream is active while reading different proportions
of different word types is still under investigation. Purpose: Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we explored activation in
ventral and dorsal visual processing streams for exception words (EXC)
and regular words (REG), during three variations of a reading task: 1)
25% EXC and 75% REG (25EXC-75REG), 2) 75% EXC and 25% REG
(75EXC-25REG), and 3) 50% EXC and 50% REG (50EXC-50REG). The
25EXC-75REG should evoke both ventral and dorsal activation, the
75EXC-25REG should evoke primarily ventral activation, and the
50EXC-50REG condition should evoke a pattern between those of the
first two conditions. Method: Participants (N=10) read lists in which proportions of EXC and REG words were manipulated. Maps for unique
versus shared regions of activation were created and reaction times
(RTs) were collected. Results: Changes in activation along ventral and
dorsal stream corresponded to changes in RT from behavioural data.
Individuals were fastest in 25EXC-75REG and activation was found in
both ventral and dorsal systems. The 50EXC-50REG condition produced
the slowest RTs and showed shared activation along both the ventral
and dorsal systems. In the 75EXC-25REG condition, participants monitored their responses for EXCs, as shown by slowed RTs and activation

in BA6. Conclusion: Manipulating the proportion of EXC and REG influences the extent to which individuals employ serial reading and/or
whole-word reading processes.

NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION SUPPORTS MISMATCH NEGATIVITY
HIERARCHICAL NETWORK FOR DISCRIMINATING MEANINGFUL
PHONEMIC CONTRASTS Shannon E. MacLean1, Lawrence Ward1;

1University of British Columbia — Several cortical regions appear active
when the mismatch negativity (MMN) scalp potential is evoked automatically in response to detectable auditory changes. It remains debatable whether the activation of multiple regions beyond the auditory
cortex is coincidental or functionally significant to the MMN response.
To investigate the functional relationship between brain regions active
during the MMN response, high density EEG was separated into sources
using independent component analysis (ICA) and source spatiotemporal
properties were examined. For a group of healthy young adults (n=14)
passively listening to infrequent changes in speech syllables (Ba vs Da),
cross-coherence analysis showed that during the MMN response synchronous interactions occurred among sources located in the left and
right STG (BA42), the left and right SFG (BA10), R IFG (BA45), and the L
IFG (BA47) and Broca’s area (BA45). In a related task, this same group
attended to the syllables, responding to deviants and standards with a
different button press. During the MMN response synchronous interactions occurred among sources located in the left and right STG (BA22),
the left IFG (BA10), the R IFG (BA47), Broca’s area (BA44) and the R
CING (BA32). These findings demonstrate consistent synchronous interaction between the STG and specialized regions in the frontal cortex during the time period when the MMN response is evoked at the scalp. This
study provides evidence for a hierarchical functional organization to
change detection in the human auditory system. Nodes in speech processing regions provide support for the role of long term memory in the
MMN network.

Rochester, 3Rochester Institute of Technology — Goals. How profoundly

deaf individuals acquire competencies in the processing of written
orthographic forms is poorly understood. This study compares the functional activation in skilled and non-skilled deaf readers during single
word and single sign processing. Methods. fMRI was used to document
the BOLD response while subjects performed implicit reading (Price et
al. 1996) and implicit sign recognition (Corina et al. 2010) tasks. Subjects
were segregated into two groups on the basis of independently administered tests of written English comprehension (PIAT) and were judged for
ASL competency (ASL-SRT, Hauser et al. 2010). Results. Initial findings
from adult signers (n=15) indicate word and sign language processing
produce activation in regions associated with lexical processing, including the left middle and superior temporal regions and left inferior frontal
regions. During word reading, skilled deaf readers activated left middle
and inferior frontal regions and bilateral mid-temporal lobe regions.
Less-skilled readers showed widespread activity including left-temporal
and ventral visual regions, which were not seen in the skilled readers.
Unexpectedly, deaf signers who scored lower on the English reading test
showed activation for ASL that was largely limited to bilateral frontal
regions. This pattern of activation contrasts with other reports in the literature, which typically reveal bilateral middle temporal gyrus activation that includes left posterior Wernicke’s territory. This unexpected
pattern may be reflective of strategic responding in the implicit sign task.
Conclusions. These data provide new evidence for neural systems that
enable the acquisition of English orthographic knowledge in the face of
severe auditory deprivation.

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 3Emory University School of
Medicine — Following the 1991 Gulf War, at least one quarter of the
returning veterans developed physiological and psychological symptoms not attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder. While three unique
syndrome subtypes have been identified to describe the groupings of
these symptoms, Syndrome 2 (Syn2) veterans are recognized as the most
cognitively impaired group. The neurological basis of Syn2 impairments
is suspected to involve the basal ganglia, and previous research has
linked basal ganglia damage to impairments in complex verbal and verbal executive functions. Hence, this study assessed participants’ performance in these cognitive domains. Parkinson’s disease (PD) was chosen
as a parallel disease model for Syn2 because of the basal ganglia’s fundamental involvement in PD. For this study, 22 Syn2 veterans and their
matched control group, and 25 PD civilians and their matched control
group completed cognitive testing. Relative to their controls, PD patients
were impaired at p < .05 on a verbal working memory measure. Relative
to their controls, Syn2 patients were impaired on complex language, verbal fluency, and verbal working memory measures. Further, patterns of
semantic priming relative to their respective controls were dissimilar for
PD and Syn2. Contrary to our hypothesis, the Syn2 group’s pattern of
performance was different from that of the PD group, aside from performance on the measure of verbal working memory. Overall, these findings suggest PD is not an appropriate disease model for Syn2. Future
research should explore similarities between Syn2 and additional subcortical disease models in order to identify the neurological mechanism
behind Syndrome 2.

University of Houston — The purpose of this study was to evaluate the

1

neural substrates underlying the early stages of word learning in monolinguals and bilinguals. In particular, we wanted to determine if monolinguals and bilinguals show differences in neural processing of newly
learned words that share orthographic similarity to their English translations. English monolingual and early Spanish-English bilingual participants learned 100 German words, 50-cognates and 50-non-cognates.
Using an event-related design 100 German words and matched English
controls were presented one at a time in an fMRI scanner, and subjects
were asked to perform a semantic task after each word was presented. In
both monolinguals and bilinguals, fewer, more localized regions were
active in the English vs. German condition (i.e. middle temporal gyrus),
suggesting a process of simple semantic retrieval as opposed to the
active translation involved in recalling new German words. In the German vs. English condition, monolinguals showed robust activation
across a wide set of language-related areas (i.e. inferior frontal gyrus,
middle temporal gyrus), suggesting difficulty with lexical, phonological,
and articulatory processing. Bilinguals had markedly less activation in
the same condition, with bilateral activity in inferior parietal lobules,
suggesting translation is much less difficult in individuals that have
experience with another language. Results also revealed that bilinguals
but not monolinguals showed brain activity that depended on orthographic similarity. Taken together these results suggest that bilingual’s
experience may help them with novel word learning.

ONLINE PROCESSING OF SCALAR IMPLICATURES IN CHINESE AS
Politzer-Ahles1,
REVEALED BY EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS Stephen

Robert Fiorentino1, Xiaoming Jiang2, Xiaolin Zhou2; 1University of Kansas,
2Peking University — In sentence processing, whether pragmatic information is integrated immediately and automatically or at a delay is a subject
of debate in experimental pragmatics. One test case is that of scalar
implicatures, which occur in propositions like “some cats are animals”,
when actually all cats are animals: the quantifier “some” is logically correct here (because at least two cats are animals) but pragmatically underinformative (because all cats should be animals). Previous event-related
potential studies on scalar implicatures typically investigated critical
words downstream of the quantifier and were thus not able to address
the possibility of immediate construction of scalar interpretations at the
moment the quantifier is encountered. The present study adopts a picture-sentence design to make the violation immediately detectable when
the quantifier is read. Participants saw pictures in which several characters are either performing the same activity or different activities, followed by sentences using “some” or “all”, yielding a 2x2 design
including both scalar violations (“some” sentences after “all” pictures”)
with matched controls, and purely incorrect assertions (“all” sentences
after “some” pictures) with matched controls. Preliminary results of electrode-level and by-region analyses for the critical scalar violation, about
which alternative theories make distinct predictions, suggest that a
broadly distributed negativity emerges over posterior electrodes in the
300-600ms time window for the scalar violation case, relative to its control, immediately when the quantifier is read. This finding is consistent
with a view in which pragmatic expectations, which are necessary for
the construction of scalar implicatures, are integrated immediately during sentence processing.

WINDOWS INTO THE VISUAL PROCESSING OF LANGUAGE: EVIDENCE
FROM COMPRESSED AND LOCALLY-REVERSED ASL So-One Hwang1,
Clifton Langdon2, Concetta Pucci2, Gaurav Mathur2, William Idsardi1;

University of Maryland, 2Gallaudet University — The goal of this study is to

demonstrate the contributions of both modality and language-dependent processing in determining the time-window of integrating the linguistic input. The phenomenon of cognitive restoration of locallyreversed speech has provided insight into integration windows (Saberi
& Perrott, 1999). While intelligibility for speech is high at smaller intervals of reversals, intelligibility falls drastically at reversals of ~60 ms,
(Greenberg & Arai, 2001). Furthermore, using the novel combination of
compressed and locally-reversed speech, Figueroa et al. (2009) shows
that these windows are not absolute properties of auditory processing
but relative to the time-length of linguistic units; with 2x compressed
speech, intelligibility falls proportionally at reversals of ~30 ms. Following this work, Hwang et al. (2010) find that intelligibility falls drastically
at ~300 ms for American Sign Language played at the normal rate, demonstrating a modality effect for linguistic processing. Participants (deaf
ASL users) were instructed to repeat back all signs they were able to
detect after each video, and percent accuracy was measured. In the
present study, by using 2x compressed ASL, where twice the amount of
linguistic information is contained in a specific time frame, we find that
the window is proportionally reduced to ~150 ms, demonstrating that
the window for the visual modality is also language-dependent. These
psychophysical results from a sign language have implications for our
understanding of how we integrate incoming language input and how
these may be related to frequencies of inherent cortical rhythms, as has
been proposed for speech (Poeppel 2003).

LATERALIZING STIMULATION OF THE POSTERIOR TEMPORAL LOBES
IMPROVES READING EFFICIENCY Peter Turkeltaub1, Jennifer Benson1,
Roy Hamilton1, Abhishek Datta2, Marom Bikson2, H. Branch Coslett1;
1University of Pennsylvania, 2City College of New York — Poor reading effi-

ciency is the most persistent problem for adults with developmental dyslexia. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between left
posterior temporal cortex (pTC) function and reading competence,
regardless of dyslexia status. Here, we demonstrate that enhancing left
lateralization of pTC using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
improves reading efficiency in adults without dyslexia. 25 right-handed
adults with no history of learning disorder participated. TDCS was
applied with the anode over the left pTC and the cathode over the right.
Subjects completed two sessions: (1) real tDCS (1.5mA for 20 min), and
(2) sham tDCS. Standardized word and nonword reading tests were
given immediately afterwards. Modeling of the induced electrical field
confirmed that the direction of current flow facilitated left pTC function,
and inhibited right pTC as intended. Relative to sham, real tDCS
induced improvements in word reading efficiency (Test of Word Reading Efficiency Sight Reading Efficiency subtest; P = .034). Every subject
that scored below average on this test improved with tDCS (P=.0005).
Such short-term gains could amplify the effect of appropriate reading
interventions when performed in conjunction with them. Further
research will be needed to investigate the cognitive locus of effect,
whether the behavior performed during stimulation alters the outcome,
whether multiple sessions result in long-lasting improvement, and
whether the effects extend to adults with persistent difficulties due to
developmental dyslexia.

COMPLEMENTARITY OF LINGUISTIC AND MUSICAL PROCESSING

Victoria Harms1, Lorin Elias1; 1University of Saskatchewan — The two hemispheres of the brain are commonly thought play complementary roles in
cognitive processing. Prior research demonstrates that linguistic processing relies predominantly on the left hemisphere whereas music-related
processing in non-musicians, such as unfamiliar melody recognition,
relies predominantly on the right hemisphere. The question remains
whether these hemispheric asymmetries reflect a causal relationship
between the lateralized functions, a bias in the underlying neural architecture of the hemispheres, or independent processes governing the lateralization of cognitive functioning. There is clear evidence of
population-level hemispheric biases for each of these functions when
measured separately, but little research has examined whether a causal
pattern of hemispheric asymmetry holds when both functions are
assessed with a within-subjects design (Elias, Bulman-Fleming &
Guylee, 1999). Using 47 healthy, right-handed participants without formal musical training, we examined whether the degree of lateralization
in a linguistic task is correlated with the degree of lateralization in an
unfamiliar melody recognition task at the level of the individual using
the dichotic listening method. When laterality scores for the two tasks
are compared within individuals only 38% of participants demonstrate a
complementary pattern of lateralization. The laterality quotients for the
two tasks are positively correlated providing evidence against the commonly assumed causal relationship and instead providing support for
Bryden’s bias model of complementarity (Bryden, 1990).

NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF GESTURE RECOGNITION Nicole

Viewing human movements, compared to non-biological motion,
engages a network of brain regions including V5, the posterior superior
temporal sulcus (STSp), the fusiform gyri, and frontal and parietal structures comprising the putative human mirror neuron system (MNS).
Interestingly, deaf and hearing native learners of sign language show
selective activation of the MNS for sign language but not non-communicative gesture, whereas normally hearing, non-signing individuals show

216

MNS activation for gesture and other types of human motion. However,
it is unknown how deaf individuals who do not use sign language, but
may rely on nonverbal cues for communication, process human movements. We measured brain activation using fMRI in post-lingually deaf
non-signers and hearing individuals, who viewed point-light movies of
non-communicative movements involving the body (e.g. walking) or
hand (e.g., playing piano), and communicative, emblematic gestures
(e.g. thumbs-up) In all subjects, compared to scrambled point-light animations, all movements engaged bilateral occipitotemporal regions
(including STSp, LOC, MTG, ITG). Hand movements engaged the MNS
to a greater extent than body movements in hearing but not deaf individuals, suggesting a similar filtering of biological motion in deaf non-signers and signers. Contrasting communicative and non-communicative
movements revealed right STSp and parietal activation in hearing people, but exclusively left hemisphere middle and posterior STS activation
in deaf participants. These results suggest that even in the absence of
sign language knowledge, deaf but not hearing people engage left hemisphere temporal structures when processing potentially communicative
gestural information.

NEURAL SYSTEMS SENSITIVE TO CONTEXT RELEVANCE AND
CONSISTENCY IN DISCOURSE INTEGRATION Giovanna Egidi1, Alfonso

Caramazza1,2; 1University of Trento, 2Harvard University — Discourse comprehension entails integration of incoming information with prior context.
Behavioral research has shown that incoming information is perceived
as consistent with prior context if it can be integrated with the immediately preceding context (local integration) or with more distal information (global integration). This fMRI experiment identifies the neural
systems sensitive to the amount of contextual information being integrated and the consistency of incoming information with prior context.
Participants listened to stories whose final sentence was either consistent
or inconsistent with the local context. The global context of these stories
was either relevant or irrelevant for the integration of this final sentence:
when global context was irrelevant, the consistency of the final sentence
was determined only by local context, but when global context was relevant, the consistency of the final sentence was a function of both local
and global context. Several regions demonstrated only a main effect of
local consistency, indicating that they integrate discourse information
locally. Other regions showed sensitivity to the relevance of global context suggesting that they mediate information integration, but are not
sensitive to local context. Finally, the left intraparietal sulcus and the
superior parietal cortex (bilaterally) showed an interaction pattern demonstrating that the effect of local consistency was reduced when a local
inconsistent ending could be explained by global context. These results
show that discourse comprehension results from the cooperation of different brain systems each concerned with different aspects of information integration.

A NOVEL METHOD FOR COMPARING THE RECRUITMENT OF NEUROCOGNITIVE RESOURCES: AN INDEX OF ADDITIVITY IN EVENT-RELATED
POTENTIALS AND ITS APPLICATION Geoffrey Valentine1, Lee Osterhout1;
1University of Washington — The

Event-Related Potential (ERP) technique
is poorly suited to spatially localizing the sources of the electrophysiological signal it measures. Establishing whether waveforms elicited by
differing stimuli reflect activity generated by the same or independent
neural processes is therefore problematic. By measuring the additivity of
individual, relative to composite, waveforms, we have developed an
index which measures the independence of the neural substrates underlying multiple ERP signals. Using a linguistic double anomaly paradigm,
in which subjects read sentences containing individual or co-occurring
violations of expectancy, we carried out three experiments in which we
systematically varied the similarity of the two expectancy violations.
Comparing the waveform resulting from the double violation to the
composite waveform created by mathematically summing waveforms
resulting from the individual violations, we computed an index of the

Tuesday, April 5, 8:00 - 10:00 am, Pacific Concourse — Poster Session H
amount of additivity in the signal, which, in turn, mirrors the independence of the neural processes underlying the individual anomalies. The
ERP additivity index therefore provides a graded measurement of the
independence of the neural substrates underlying the processing of the
multiple stimuli, ranging from complete independence, reflected in perfect ERP additivity, to complete overlap, reflected in zero additivity.
Although it provides no information on the spatial location of the
sources of particular ERP components, the graded nature of the additivity index allows a meaningful comparison of the ratio of independence
of the neural resources elicited by various stimuli which can be applied
between experiments.

AN ERP INVESTIGATION OF TONAL VERSUS PHONEMIC INFLUENCES ON
SPOKEN WORD RECOGNITION IN MANDARIN CHINESE Jeffrey Malins1,

Marc Joanisse1; 1University of Western Ontario — Tonal languages like Mandarin Chinese use both phonemic and tonal features to differentiate
words. In this study we compared the neural underpinnings of these two
types of information in processing auditory speech. Event related potentials were recorded while adult native speakers of Mandarin (N = 19)
judged whether auditory words matched or mismatched visually presented pictures. Mismatching words were of the following nature: segmental (e.g., picture: hua1 ‘flower’; sound: hua4 ‘painting’); cohort (e.g.,
picture: hua1 ‘flower’; sound: hui1 ‘grey’); rhyme (e.g., picture: hua1
‘flower’; sound: gua1 ‘melon’); tonal (e.g., picture: hua1 ‘flower’; sound:
jing1 ‘whale’); unrelated (e.g., picture: hua1 ‘flower’; sound: lang2
‘wolf’). Expectancy violations in the segmental and cohort conditions
were detected at a similar onset, marked by a similar latency of modulation of the phonological mapping negativity (PMN). This result suggests
that tonal and phonemic information are accessed in parallel; however,
effects were less persistent and more left-lateralized in the segmental
versus cohort condition, suggesting different mechanisms underlie tonal
versus phonemic processing. We also observed evidence for effects of
word-final overlap in both the rhyme and tonal conditions, marked by
an attenuated late N400 component compared to unrelated mismatches.
This is suggestive of feedback from lexical to sublexical levels of spoken
word processing, resulting in facilitated recognition of word-final phonemes or tone. Together, the results suggest key modifications are
needed for existing models of speech processing to accommodate the
tonal languages spoken by a large proportion of the world’s speakers.

THE TIMECOURSE OF IMPLICIT SINGLE-LETTER PROCESSING: N170 AND
RHYME EFFECTS Courtney Stevens1, Autumn McIlraith1; 1Willamette
University — Previous event-related brain potential (ERP) studies report a
left-lateralized enhancement of the N170 over posterior brain areas to
words as compared to other classes of visual stimuli (e.g., Bentin et al,
1999). This effect, apparent even during implicit processing tasks, is proposed to index automatic phonological processing emerging from the
repeated pairing of words with left-lateralized language systems (Maurer et al, 2010). However, it is unclear whether similar effects are
observed with single-letter stimuli, although individual letters represent
the initial unit of literacy learning for most children and may be particularly useful in developmental neuroimaging studies. The goal of the
present study was to assess whether adult fluent readers show similar
left-lateralized N170 effects during implicit processing of single-letter
stimuli, as well as whether such stimuli automatically engage phonological processing. Adult participants completed a one-back task in separate
blocks with single-letter (LT) or false-font (FF) stimuli. Within the LT
blocks, half of the letters rhymed with ‘e’ and the other half were nonrhyming. ERPs were recorded to the LT and FF stimuli. Results indicated
that over posterior regions, the N170 was larger to LT than FF stimuli,
but this effect was bilateral as opposed to left-lateralized. This bilateral
effect was related to level of implicit phonological processing of letters,
as indexed by the effect of rhyming vs nonrhyming letters in LT blocks.
Taken together, these data suggest that whereas single-letters are distinguished from non-letter stimuli during implicit processing tasks, they
lack the strong left-lateralized bias observed with whole word stimuli.

PRESERVED MID-FUSIFORM ACTIVATION FOR FAMILIAR WORDS IN A
PATIENT WITH PURE ALEXIA Suzanne Welcome1, Adrian Pasquarella2, Xi
Chen2, David Olson2, Marc F. Joanisse1; 1University of Western Ontario,

2University of Toronto — We

explored activation in the left fusiform gyrus
in H.E., a published author with pure alexia as a result of a stroke. H.E.’s
lesion is localized to the left inferior temporal lobe and restricted primarily to white matter. His word identification remains dysfluent and laborious despite therapy. We used fMRI to examine cortical activity as H.E.
viewed a variety of orthographic stimuli (words, nonwords, consonant
strings) as well as non-orthographic objects. Surprisingly, H.E. showed
cortical activation in the mid-fusiform area during the processing of
words and word-like stimuli, suggesting that this region’s role in processing visual words is intact despite his severely impaired reading. A
portion of the left inferior occipital cortex showed greater activation to
words, nonwords and consonant strings than to non-orthographic stimuli. However, H.E. showed abnormally little activation in other portions
of the temporal lobes while viewing words. We suggest that H.E.’s alexia
results from a functional disconnection between the mid-fusiform region
and other parts of the reading network rather than dysfunction of the
mid-fusiform region itself. These findings are discussed in terms of current models of reading, and in particular the role that mid-fusiform
gyrus plays in word recognition vs. production.

CONTRARY ACTIVATION PATTERNS OF ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR BRAIN

State Key Laboratory for Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal

Beijing, P.R. China, 3Department of Applied Social Sciences, Hong Kong
Polytechnic University — Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), the present study investigated how reading ability modulates
the brain activation when Chinese school children performed phonological and orthographic judgment task. Twenty-seven children aged 8-11
years old were recruited and divided into three groups according to
their Chinese reading performance, and were labeled as High, Medium,
Low level group respectively. One-way ANOVA showed a main effect
of reading ability in several brain regions, including posterior regions in
bilateral calcarine, right fusiform gyrus, left lingual gyrus and anterior
regions primarily in left middle frontal gyrus. With the increasing of
reading ability, brain activations in the posterior regions, especially the
primary visual cortex, was more activated in both the phonological and
orthographic tasks. On the contrary, the anterior region of left middle
fontal gyrus was significantly stronger activated in readers with low
reading ability, demonstrating that compared with high level readers,
low level readers rely more on the anterior regions when performing
both tasks. The results were further confirmed by Regions of Interest
(ROIs) analysis in posterior site of right fusiform gyrus and anterior site
of left middle frontal gyrus. We propose that while readers with high
reading ability benefit from intact activity in the posterior visual system
for the development of reading, their peers with low reading ability,
instead, recruit anterior regions as a compensation for the underdevelopment of posterior systems.

THE ROLES OF ORTHOGRAPHY, PHONOLOGY, AND MORPHEME IN
CHINESE SPOKEN COMPOUND WORD RECOGNITION: AN ERP STUDY

Lijuan Zou1, Youyi Liu1, Hua Shu1; 1State Key Laboratory of Cognitive
conNeuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, China — The
straints from phonology and orthography have been broadly investigated in spoken word recognition, whereas the role of morpheme awaits
more attention, especially for a language with the majority of compound
words consist of two or more morphemes like Chinese. The property
that the large number of homophones and homographs in Chinese could
make the differentiation of orthography and morpheme have a prominent role during the time course of Chinese spoken word recognition.
This study aims to investigate the effects of phonology, orthography,
and morpheme on Chinese spoken compound word recognition. Using
an auditory priming paradigm, two experiments, with the relations

218

between the first syllable of prime and that of target words varying
along orthography, phonology or morpheme, were conducted. 21 subjects participated the experiments. Subjects were asked to judge whether
the target word they heard was a real word or a pseudo-word, while
ignoring the prime word. Results showed that the N400 amplitude
increased as sharing phonology between prime and target words, but
decreased as sharing orthography. Sharing morpheme induced largest
N400 amplitude especially for semantic unrelated words. In addition,
morpheme effect is different from semantic priming effect on the topographic analysis, i.e., N400 for morpheme effect mainly distributed on
anterior-central whereas semantic N400 had a maximum at central-posterior areas. These data suggested that orthography was accessed
quickly and, reversely, facilitated the processing of spoken word recognition, and morpheme had a prominent role in Chinese compound word
recognition and the framework of spoken word recognition should catch
this feature.

RECOGNITION OF WORDS IN FLUENT SPEECH: EVIDENCE FROM AN ERPSTUDY WITH EARLY BILINGUALS Nicole Altvater-Mackensen1, Nivedita

Mani1; 1Georg-Elias-Müller-Institute for Psychology, Georg-August-University
Göttingen — An increasing number of studies suggest that lexical access

in bilinguals is not language-selective but that bilinguals activate words
from both their languages when processing speech. Yet, most of these
studies investigated (visual) recognition of isolated words. The current
study examined whether word recognition in fluent sentences presented
in the first language is influenced by the phonological similarity of the
words to words from the second language. While early German-English
bilinguals listened to German sentences, we measured subjects’ ERPs.
Target words in the sentences were either German-English homophones
(eagle – Igel ‘hedgehog’), German words that are phonologically closely
related to English words (kitten – Kittel ‘smock’) or German words that
had no phonological relation to English words. Results show a difference
in the N400-effect between words that have a cross-lingual relation and
words that are not related across languages. Between 200 and 500 ms
after word onset, subjects show a more positive waveform for homophones and German words that are related to English than for German
words that have no relation to English, suggesting that lexical activation
is influenced by the cross-lingual relation. This result is in line with earlier studies showing that bilinguals activate words from both languages
in word recognition, but extends the results in demonstrating that this
effect is neither bound to homophones, nor to visual recognition. Importantly, we show that the effect is not only found when recognizing words
in isolation but also while processing words in fluent speech in the bilingual’s dominant language.

PHONOLOGICAL CO-ACTIVATION OF BOTH LANGUAGES IN BILINGUAL
SPEECH PRODUCTION Katharina Spalek1, Noriko Hoshino2, Markus
Damian3, Guillaume Thierry2; 1Humboldt-University Berlin, 2Bangor University,
3University of Bristol — One question in bilingual language production is

whether the language not currently spoken is activated during speech
planning. We collected event-related potentials (ERPs) in late GermanEnglish bilinguals while they named coloured line drawings using adjective–noun dyads exclusively in English, e.g., blue bird. The onset of
adjectives and nouns could overlap in English (L2-overlap, e.g. blue bird
vs. green bird) or in German, the speakers’ native language, which was
not produced during the experiment (L1-overlap, e.g., red skirt –‘roter
Rock‘ vs. blue skirt –‘blauer Rock‘). In both cases of overlap we observed
a more positive going waveform at frontocentral electrodes in the N400
range (280 to 500 ms), even though, behaviourally, L1-overlap has been
previously shown to cause inhibition and L2-overlap to cause facilitation
(cf. Spalek & Damian, in prep.). Strikingly, ERPs in the related and unrelated conditions in L1 diverged about 60 ms earlier (~290 ms after stimulus onset) than ERPs in the related and unrelated conditions in L2. In
sum, the data not only show that L1 phonology is activated during L2
speech production, but they also show that L1 is available earlier than L2
phonological information, even in the case of proficient speakers and
even when only L2 production is required in the course of the experiment. This finding is compatible with a model of bilingual language production in which activation cascades from an activated concept to the
phonological representation of both languages.

ERP EVIDENCE FOR THE ROLE OF SECOND LANGUAGE (L2) KNOWLEDGE
ON READING ALOUD IN THE FIRST LANGUAGE (L1) Niels Schiller1, Ilse

Ceusters1, Kalinka Timmer1; 1LUCL & LIBC, Leiden University — Previous
research has shown that words of the second language (L2) can be
primed with homophonic words of the first language (L1; Brysbaert et
al., 1999) indicating phonological priming from L1 to L2. The Masked
Onset Priming Effect (MOPE) is considered to have a phonological basis
and has often been reported in reading aloud L1 words (e.g. Forster &
Davis, 1991; Kinoshita, 2000; Schiller, 2007). Using the MOPE, we investigated whether L2 phonology also influences reading aloud L1 words,
even when speakers are in their native monolingual L1 environment. In
the present study, bilingual Dutch (L1) participants read aloud English
(L2) target words primed visually by onset-related L2 words using four
conditions: 1) graphemic and phonemic match (O+P+; e.g. kettle –
KNAAP), 2) phonemic mismatch (O+P–; e.g. knife – KNAAP), 3) graphemic mismatch (O–P+; e.g. curve – KNAAP), 4) graphemic and phonemic
mismatch (O–P–; e.g. bush – KNAAP). Orthographically related primes
did not lead to faster response times, but event-related brain potentials
(ERPs) revealed orthographic priming. Phonologically related L2 primes
decreased the response times. ERPs supported these phonological priming effects. The results demonstrate that English phonology is also activated in Dutch participants, even when they are in their native
monolingual environment and are less familiar with the orthography of
the L2.

A NEURONAL INDEX OF CONNECTION STRENGTH IN LEXICAL MEMORY
CIRCUITS: EARLY ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES REFLECT
FREQUENCY OF UNATTENDED SPOKEN WORDS Yury Shtyrov1, Lilli

Kimppa2, Friedemann Pulvermüller1, Teija Kujala2; 1MRC Cognition and Brain
Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK, 2Cognitive Brain Research Unit, University of
Helsinki, Finland — How are words represented in the brain and can these
representations be qualitatively assessed? Recent research demonstrates
that neurophysiological signatures of individual words can be measured
when subjects do not focus their attention on speech. These automatic
activations, manifest as negative deflections of ERPs, can appear surprisingly early (within ~200 ms) and are based on robust connections within
neuronal circuits encoding individual words that ignite even when

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

attentional resources are scarce. A critical prediction of this framework is
that words with high frequency of occurrence have especially strongly
connected underlying memory circuits and should thus yield more negative ERPs compared with rarer words. We tested this prediction by presenting our subjects, in passive non-attend conditions, with acoustically
matched high- and low-frequency words and pseudo-word controls.
Using factorial and correlation analyses, we found that already at 120 ms
after the stimulus information was available response amplitude was
modulated by the words’ lexical frequency. Topographic mapping and
source analysis suggested that this early automatic frequency effect originates from the left inferior-frontal cortices. While, at ~120ms, lexical differences between words and pseudo-words were seen only for the most
frequent words, later-on (~270 ms), a more global lexicality effect with
bilateral perisylvian sources was found for all stimuli, suggesting faster
access to more frequent lexical entries. Our results support the account
of word memory traces as interconnected neuronal circuits, and suggest
that speed and magnitude of their activation are determined by their
internal connection strength, which, in turn, is determined by everyday
language use.

BEHAVIOURAL AND EEG+MEG EVIDENCE FOR EARLY RETRIEVAL OF

Olaf Hauk1, Caroline Coutout1, Anneka Holden2, Yuanyuan Chen1; 1MRC
Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, 2Department of Experimental
Psychology, University of Oxford — Timing information from electrophysiological data is becoming increasingly relevant for models of visual word
recognition. It is also important for the comparison of specific stages of
the word recognition process among healthy participant or patient
groups. In this study, we attempted to 1) provide a lower limit for the
earliest latencies of lexical and semantic information retrieval; 2) separate stimulus- from response-related brain responses; 3) test for serial or
parallel retrieval of lexical and semantic information. Participants performed 2 different types of Go/NoGo tasks: lexical decision (LD) and
semantic decision (SD). In experiment 1 (E1), button press latencies as
well as 64-channel ERP data were recorded. Statistical analysis of ERP
data was performed using SensorSPMs in SPM5. In experiment 2 (E2),
participants responded by eye blinks while 306-channel MEG and 70channel EEG were recorded. Reaction times around 375 ms in E1 and
around 300 ms in E2 reliably distinguished stimulus categories in both
LD and SD, reflected in the onset of positive d-prime distributions. In the
ERP data, a reliable difference between Go and NoGo conditions was
observed around 200 ms. Region-of-interest analysis of minimum norm
source estimates derived from EEG+MEG data showed that left perisylvian brain areas distinguished words from pseudowords already
before 200 ms. Our results demonstrate that brain responses around 200
ms already reflect target detection or response preparation. We conclude
that earliest retrieval of lexical and semantic information affecting
behavioural responses occurs in parallel before 200 ms.

DISSOCIATING INFLECTIONAL AND DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY:
EVIDENCE FROM POLISH Zanna Szlachta1, Mirjana Bozic1, William

Marslen-Wilson1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK —

Different types of lexical complexity in English modulate the involvement of different fronto-temporal language networks during language
comprehension (Bozic et al., 2010). Morphologically complex inflected
verbs (jumped, agreed) selectively activate left fronto-temporal areas,
while derivationally complex words (bravely, darkness) show more distributed bi-hemispheric effects which do not include left frontal cortex,
consistent with a whole word processing account. In this study we ask
whether Polish, a language with much richer inflectional and derivational paradigms, shows a similar dissociation between inflectional and
derivational morphology. We use aspectual verb pairs that allow for an
elegant comparison between these two types of complexity in a passive
listening efMRI experiment. Polish aspectual prefixes can either be
purely inflectional (e.g. the prefix na- changes the imperfective verb stem

Poster Session I — Tuesday, April 5, 3:00 - 5:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
pisac' – to write, to the perfective form napisac' – to write, perf, with no
change in meaning) or mixed inflectional/derivational (e.g. the prefix
prze- can change both aspect and meaning of the stem, as in przepisac' –
to rewrite/copy, perf). We compared neural responses to each type of
affix (and to unprefixed verb stems) in a design adapted to multivariate
analysis techniques. Using Representational Similarity Analysis we
found that purely inflectional affixes show coherent patterns of activation in inferior frontal areas bilaterally, while inflectional/derivational
affixes are much more heterogeneous. This is cross-linguistic evidence to
support the claim that inflectional and derivational morphemes support
qualitatively different neurocognitive processing functions, with only
inflectional morphology fully engaging key combinatorial linguistic processing functions associated with left perisylvian cortex.

EARLIEST BRAIN SIGNATURES OF LEXICAL ACCESS TO SPOKEN WORDS:
MEG EVIDENCE Lucy J MacGregor1, Friedemann Pulvermüller1, Maarten

van Casteren1, Yury Shtyrov1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
Cambridge — How quickly can the listener’s brain access information
about perceived words in the mental lexicon? Previous research has
demonstrated a neurophysiological distinction between passively presented spoken words and pseudo-words as soon as 100-150ms after they
could be identified, which has been used as evidence for automatic lexical access within the same time frame. However, one criticism of these
studies is that they used the oddball paradigm and the mismatch negativity brain response, which require unnatural repetition of a small number of stimuli. Here we address this issue by directly comparing
listeners’ neuromagnetic brain responses to multiple (N>100) distinct
words (monosyllabic CVC) with phonologically and psycholinguistically matched pseudo-words. Each stimulus was auditorily presented
only once in a random sequence, whilst volunteers were engaged in a
distracter task (watching a film) used to minimise the influence of attention on brain responses. MEG was recorded using a high-density wholehead sensor array (Elekta-Neuromag). Event-related fields and their gradients were calculated relative to the onset of the word uniqueness
point, determined in a behavioural gating study, which coincided with
the onset of stimulus-final consonants. Significantly greater activity for
words compared to pseudo-words – a putative index of lexical access –
was observed as early as 60ms, with later effects also occurring at ~110180 ms and ~300-400 ms. Minimum Norm Estimation revealed that left
perisylvian sources underpinned the early lexical enhancement of the
brain response. The results offer support for automatic rapid activation
of neural memory circuits for spoken words within less than 1/5 second.

AUTOMATIC PROCESSING OF DERIVATIONAL AND INFLECTIONAL
FORMS IN SPOKEN WORD COMPREHENSION: COMBINED MEG-EEG
EVIDENCE Caroline M. Whiting1, Yury Shtyrov1, William D. Marslen-Wilson1;
1

MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge UK — Extensive research
now suggests that the presence of a potential stem and affix within a
word (e.g. corn-er) is sufficient to trigger attempts at morphological
decomposition, regardless of word meaning. Using combined magnetoand electroencephalography, we investigated how the processing of spoken words is modulated by such morpho-phonological cues. The mismatch negativity (MMN), an index of long-term linguistic memory
traces, was recorded to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics elicited by
words of varied complexity: transparent derivational affixation (baker),
pseudo-affixation (beaker), inflectional affixation (bakes, beaks) and
non-affixed forms, in the absence of focused attention. Matched
pseudowords were used as acoustic and phonological controls. A critical
variable was semantic transparency within the derivational forms,
where the embedded stem was related or unrelated to the meaning of
the whole form (baker vs. beaker). Results revealed an initial peak 150200 ms after the deviation point, primarily localized to left superior temporal cortex. This early component was sensitive both to lexicality showing a larger response to real words than to pseudowords - and to
morphological structure, showing increased activity for a potential but

invalid segmentation (beak-er) in left fronto-temporal cortex. Effects for
inflected forms appeared later, with a significant dissociation at 300 ms
reflecting a more left-lateralized response to the verbal deviant. A further component emerging at 315 ms revealed differential processing of
non-affixed forms within bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. These results
support recent theories pointing to early and automatic processing based
on the presence of phonological cues to morphological structure.

SPEECH
COMPREHENSION Li Su1, Elisabeth Fonteneau1, Cai Wingfield1, William

Marslen-Wilson1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK —

Although the neural basis of speech comprehension has been a growing
focus for neuroimaging research, detailed neural models of morpho-lexical processing are notably absent. Here we explore how the underlying
properties of lexical constituents are computed in neural networks situated in bilateral fronto-temporal brain regions. A novel method that
reveals the fine grained structure of neural computation (with centimetre
and millisecond precision) has been developed based on the Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of MEG/EEG data in source space using
searchlight techniques. Specifically, we search the data in time and space
for neurocomputational signatures that are correlated to five theoretical
models. These models describe different dimensions of lexical complexity, and form a hierarchical structure with basic models progressively
evolving into complex models. The three basic models (Simple Suffix,
Stem and IRP) capture single dimensions respectively, regular inflectional morphology, general processing demands and phonological cues
to the presence of inflection. The more complex Suffix model captures
the critical process of interpreting the acoustic information carried by the
potential inflection (the IRP model), while the Word model integrates the
Suffix model and the Stem model to reflect the dynamic interaction
between stem and inflectional morphemes. Searchlight RSA analyses
show weak and diffused activation patterns for the basic models, while
the complex models (Suffix and Word) result in stronger and more focal
activation in both inferior frontal areas and the temporal lobes. This supports a hierarchical view of morpholexical processing and potentially
provides a system level account of dynamic neural processing for speech
comprehension.

THE EFFECT OF MEANING ENTROPY DURING AUDITORY HOMOPHONE
RECOGNITION: MEG EVIDENCE FOR AMODAL LEXICAL ENTRIES

Gwyneth Lewis1, Alec Marantz1; 1New York University — Several MEG studies
report correlations between ~350 ms superior temporal (ST) activation
(the MEG M350) and lexical properties of visually presented words
(Solomyak & Marantz, 2009, 2010; Lewis et al., in press; Simon et al., in
press). The latest of these studies found meaning entropy effects at the
M350 during visual recognition of homographic homophones (orthographically and phonetically identical words with distinct meanings).
Entropy reflects the relative frequencies of meanings for each homophone, estimated from the number of senses for each meaning. If each
meaning has a distinct lexical entry, higher entropy implies greater competition among entries for recognition (compare high entropy "pawn"
with low entropy "bank"). To test whether representations accessed at
the M350 are amodal, we exploited the meaning entropy effect and replicated the homophone result in the auditory modality by employing
Simon’s 500 homophones as speech stimuli in an MEG lexical decision
experiment involving 10 subjects. Analyses were in source space using
MNE and structural MRIs. Transverse temporal regions of interest
(ROIs) yielded negative ST activation (as in Simon et al.). Activation
from these temporal ROIs correlated significantly with the entropy variable at ~300 ms, similar to the latency and direction of Simon’s effect,
and in the same ROI -- greater entropy yielded greater activation, consistent with the lexical competition model. The M350 reflects similar resolution stages in auditory and visual word recognition whereby amodal

NEURAL CORRELATES OF AMBIGUOUS AND UNAMBIGUOUS VERB
PROCESSING Aya Meltzer Asscher1, Julia Schuchard1, Dirk-Bart den

Ouden2, Cynthia K. Thompson1; 1Northwestern University, 2University of South
Carolina, Columbia, SC — Verbs differ with regard to their argument struc-

ture, i.e. the number and type of arguments they select, and studies have
shown that differences in argument structure complexity map onto the
brain. The present study examines the neural correlates of an instantiation of argument structure complexity not explicitly targeted before:
argument structure ambiguity. In English, many lexical entries (e.g.
break, close) denote two different verbal alternates, a transitive and an
intransitive one. The processing of these entries thus entails accessing
two thematic grids. In contrast, other verbs (e.g. laugh, wander) are
unambiguous, and have only the intransitive argument structure. The
present study used fMRI to compare neural activation induced by processing the two types of verbs. 14 healthy monolingual English speakers
performed a lexical decision task in response to ambiguous verbs, unambiguous verbs and pseudowords. Participants exhibited enhanced activations for ambiguous relative to unambiguous verbs in regions
previously implicated in the processing of complex verb argument structure: middle and superior temporal gyri, as well as the angular and
supramarginal gyri bilaterally. An additional cluster was observed in the
left middle and superior frontal gyri (BA 9). The present results corroborate previous studies of argument structure processing, implicating a
posterior network of activation involved in processing complex argument structure representations. The study also contributes to what is
known about the neural mechanisms associated with processing lexical
ambiguity, and is compatible with previous results showing involvement of left middle and superior frontal regions in ambiguity processing.

MEG EVIDENCE FOR RECOMBINATION STAGE IN FULL DECOMPOSITION
MODEL OF VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION Joseph
Fruchter1,
Alec

Marantz1; 1New York University — During visual word recognition, the MEG
response ~300-400ms post-stimulus onset from the middle and superior
temporal lobe displays many of the hallmarks of lexical access
(Pylkkänen & Marantz, 2003), while the Anterior Midline Field (AMF)
reflects semantic properties of the combination of words (Pylkkänen &
McElree, 2007). Here we developed a statistical measure of the semantic
coherence of suffixed words based on the residuals from a regression
model involving surface frequency, base frequency, and biphone transition probability. We also investigated the influence of derivational family entropy (Moscoso del Prado Martin, Kostic, & Baayen, 2004). Full
decomposition models of complex word recognition predict correlations
with family entropy at stem access, followed by correlations with surface
frequency and semantic coherence during the recombination stage. MEG
data was obtained from 10 subjects performing a visual lexical decision
task on 200 words composed of a monomorphemic stem and suffix (“er,” “-ness,” “-ly,” “-able”). We used MNE and FreeSurfer to generate
cortically-constrained minimum norm estimates for analysis of activity
in source space. Using automatically parcellated anatomical regions of
interest (ROIs), we investigated the correlation of neural activity in left
temporal and orbitofrontal ROIs with stimulus variables. The left temporal activity correlated with derivational family entropy (~240-390ms) followed by surface frequency (~430-500ms), suggesting an earlier stage of
lexical access for a stem followed by recombination of stem and suffix, as
predicted by full decomposition models. The left orbitofrontal activity
(AMF) correlated with semantic coherence (~350-500ms), suggesting an
equivalence of semantic composition between words and between morphemes.

BILINGUAL LEXICAL ACTIVATION IS MODULATED BY FACIAL CUES OF
THE LISTENER’S LINGUISTIC IDENTITY Ping Li1, Yunqing Li1, Jing Yang1,

Qing X. Yang1; 1Pennsylvania State University — It is widely accepted that
proficient bilingual speakers non-selectively activate items from both
languages in the mental lexicon during speech comprehension or production. Given this non-selectivity the question arises as to how bilinguals, while speaking in one language, avoid significant interference
from the other, non-intended language. In this study we presented participants with faces that prompt the linguistic identity of the listener
(Asian vs. Caucasian faces) and asked the participants to perform a picture-naming task inside and outside the scanner. Chinese-English bilingual participants saw a fixation cross, a face with a picture frame (red or
blue, as cue to the naming language), and named the picture in either
their first language (L1: Chinese) or second language (L2: English).
Behavioral results indicate that naming was facilitated when the naming
language and the linguistic identity of the faces were consistent (i.e.,
naming in L1 while seeing Asian face, or naming in L2 seeing Caucasian
face), compared with conditions when these were inconsistent. fMRI
results revealed that when the naming language and the linguistic identity of the faces were consistent, stronger activation was seen in the right
insula and bilateral anterolateral frontal gyrus, but when these were
inconsistent, stronger activation was seen in the inferior frontal gyrus
and the left middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that naming in
the weaker L2 requires greater involvement of the PFC, and that facial
cues of the listener’s linguistic identity modulate the activation of the
naming language, leading to increased left frontal activities during conflict resolution.

THE ROLE OF WHITE MATTER PATHWAYS IN MAPPING WORDS TO
MEANING Denise Y Harvey1, Timothy M Ellmore2, A. Cris Hamilton1, Tatiana

T Schnur1; 1Rice University, 2University of Texas Medical School — Understanding a word requires decoding auditory or visual information, and
access to semantic knowledge (Hillis, Rapp, Romani, & Caramazza,
1990). The posterior temporal cortex mediates both visual and spoken
abstract word form processing (Price, 2000), and the anterior temporal
lobes serve as an amodal semantic store (Patterson, Nestor, & Rogers,
2007). However, it is unclear how information is transmitted between
these disparate regions. We hypothesize that a white matter pathway,
the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) mediates lexical semantic processing by connecting the temporal-occipital junction with the anterior
temporal lobe. We collected diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from
participants with varying degrees of word comprehension impairments
as a result of left hemisphere stroke. Deterministic tractography methods
were used to isolate the ILF in both hemispheres. Accuracy on a single
word, single picture matching task (Hillis et al., 1990) significantly correlated with both left and right ILF integrity (as measured by fractional
anisotropy (FA)) such that lower FA values were related to poorer performance. The results suggest that the ILF is important for understanding the meaning of a word as it carries information from regions
specialized for decoding presemantic word form information to stored
semantic knowledge. The finding that the right ILF also correlates with
performance may suggest that although single word comprehension is
weakly left lateralized, it may be compensated for by the right hemisphere (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007; Bozic, Tyler, Ives, Randall, & MarslenWilson, 2010).

who use American Sign Language as their primary language. Participants (mean age = 29.4 years; education = 17 years) performed a yes/no
semantic decision (concrete concept?) and a phonological decision (two
syllables?) for separate blocks of printed English words (10 words per
block, ITI = 3s) while undergoing fMRI (3T GE scanner, 40 3.5mm axial
slices, TR = 2s, FOV = 22.4mm, 240 volumes). Across two runs, six blocks
of each task were interspersed with control blocks during which participants decided whether or not false font strings were underlined. Data
collection for a matched group of hearing readers is currently underway.
Preliminary analyses of data from nine deaf readers revealed that syllable counting, relative to semantic decision, elicited increased activity in
left hemisphere regions typically reported for phonological processing in
hearing readers (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus; inferior parietal cortex).
However, deaf readers also showed heightened activity in right hemisphere homologues of these regions. We also observed a different distribution of neural activity for phonological (more dorsal) and semantic
(more ventral) processing within left inferior frontal cortex (cf. Poldrack
et al., 1999). Thus, skilled deaf readers may rely on left hemisphere circuits for reading single words, but require additional right hemisphere
regions to make explicit phonological decisions.

PHONOLOGICAL UNDERSPECIFICATION IN THE MENTAL LEXICON AND
NASAL CONFUSABILITY Noriko Tanigawa1, Ramin Rahni1, John J. Kim1,
Mark W. Geisler1; 1San Francisco State University — The purpose of the

present study is to determine the extent to which predictable abstract
information about speech sounds is stored in the mental lexicon and
how it is processed, using electrophysiology. Past studies investigated
this question by contrasting the processing of coronals (/n /, /d/) that
have alternating surface forms (e.g., /n/ pronounced as [n] in rain, [m]
in rainbow) with that of non-coronals (/m/, /b/) that do not. To tease
out the Lexicality (real vs. pseudo) x Place (coronal vs. non-coronal)
interaction, we added Manner (nasal /n/, /m/ vs. oral /d/, /b/) and
Quantity (neutralized geminate vs. singleton, e.g., nn vs. n). Following
Friedrich et al.’s (2006) auditory lexical decision paradigm, monomorphemic English nouns were selected that had a uniqueness point with a
coronal or a non-coronal as the first phoneme of the second syllable. A
pseudoword was created from each real word by switching the place of
articulation between coronal and non-coronal (e.g., picnic to *picmic;
helmet to *helnet). Event-related potentials (n = 10) were time-locked to
the uniqueness/deviation points. Preliminary results show an asymmetric pseudoword effect on the N400 amplitude driven by nasals, suggesting increased processing load by Nasal Confusability. Centroid latency
differences became significant earlier in the NonCoronal condition but
later in the Coronal condition, in which latency was shorter for
pseudowords among geminates but longer for pseudowords among singletons. These processing speed differences suggest that the place feature might be un(der)specified for coronals but specified for neutralized
geminates (Ghini, 2002) in the mental lexicon.

ERP MASKED PRIMING INVESTIGATION ON THE
DECOMPOSITION OF SINGLE CHARACTER KANJI Kana

RADICAL

Okano1,
Jonathan Grainger2,3, Phillip J. Holcomb1; 1Tufts University, 2Aix-Marseille
University Marseille, 3CNRS — ERP research on the decomposition of morphologically complex words in English have provided evidence suggesting that not only are complex words decomposed into their constituent
morphemes, but words with pseudomorphemes (i.e., corner) are also
decomposed. In the present study, a similar investigation using Japanese
Kanji was conducted. Radicals in Kanji are the smallest component of a
character that still carry meaning and are thought to play a similar role to
morphemes in alphabetic languages. The current experiment used
masked morphological priming to look for evidence of radical decomposition of single character Kanji. We used the three priming conditions
that have been investigated in the field of morphological decomposition.
These were prime-target pairs that are 1) semantically and orthographically related (Transparent condition), 2) semantically and orthographi-

222

cally opaque (Opaque condition), and 3) semantically unrelated but
orthographically related (Orthographic condition). The results showed a
significant priming effect in the N250 component for Transparent and
Opaque conditions but not the Orthographic condition, indicating that
single character Kanji are decomposed as a function of the transparency
of the semantic radicals.

AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY OF AUDITORY LANGUAGE
SWITCHING IN SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNERS Katherine J. Midgley1,2,

Phillip J. Holcomb1, Jonathan Grainger2; 1Tufts University, 2LPC, CNRS
Marseille, France — Whether in production or comprehension, bilinguals
can and do freely switch between their two languages. What are the processing costs and underlying neural mechanisms associated with these
language switches? We investigated this by presenting, in the auditory
modality, common, single-word non-cognates in English and French to
24 native French speakers who were learning English. Critical items
were either “switch” items, for which the language differed from the two
previously presented words (CLAVIER - POMME - BEACH) or they
were “non-switch” items, in which case the language remained the same
across the previously presented items (WINDOW - FIGHT - DRINK).
Event-related potentials were recorded from 32 scalp electrodes to each
critical, final item (BEACH compared to DRINK). Consistent with previous research by our group we found a widespread language effect with
larger negativities to words in L1 relative to L2 in an extended epoch
starting at 150ms and continuing through 600ms. For language switching we also found L1 items showed early effects of switching between
150 and 250ms as well as later effects between 400 to 600ms. No effects of
switching were found for L2 items. These results appear to be consistent
with theories postulating a greater inhibition of the dominant L1 during
L2 processing followed by a need for greater reactivation of L1 after a
switch. The findings will be discussed within the framework of current
models of bilingual language control.

DISSOCIATING ROOTS AND WORD PATTERNS IN ARABIC: EVIDENCE
FROM APHASIA Sami Boudelaa1, Ali Idrissi1, Renee Beland2, William

Marslen-Wilson3; 1United Arab Emirates University, 2University of Montreal,
Canada, 3MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, UK — There are currently

two opposing views of the internal morphological structure of words in
Semitic languages. One view argues for a linguistically universal stembased account. The other claims that Semitic morphology is characterized by a non-concatenative morphological structure whereby a tri-consonantal root conveying semantics is interleaved with a word pattern
that conveys morphosyntactic and phonological information. On this
view, roots and word patterns have an independent status in language
processing and can be selectively impaired and spared. Here we provide
evidence for a dissociation between these two morphemic elements in
the brain. We use the auditory-auditory priming task to assess the performance of an Arabic speaking aphasic with left perisylvian damage,
known from previous production studies to have specific problems with
the consonantal root. Word pairs sharing a root and either a transparent
(e.g., [ri>Asah]-[ra>ys] presidency-president) or an opaque (e.g.,
[miTraqah]-[Taryq] hammer-road) semantic relationship do not show
the facilitation normally observed. Two further control conditions, a
semantic condition (e.g., [SAHib]-[rafyq] friend-comrade) and a phonological condition (e.g., [niSf] –[naSr] half-victory) also fail to show any
facilitation. In contrast, prime and target pairs sharing a word pattern
(e.g., [Axraj]-[AElam] take out-inform) show significant facilitation both
in latencies and error rates. Consistent with this, linear mixed-effect analyses show that the family size of the word pattern but not of the root
modulates priming. These results suggest that processes extracting a
word pattern can remain intact even when root processing is impaired,
consistent with a decompositional account separating root and word
pattern morphemes.

BILINGUAL PHONOLOGICAL PRIMING: WORD-WORD RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN LANGUAGES AND ACROSS DEVELOPMENT Katie Von Holzen1,

Nivedita Mani1; 1Georg-August-Universität Göttingen — Phonological priming effects operate across the two languages of a bilingual – words in one
language can prime words in the other language (Van Wijnendaele and
Brysbaert; 2002). These results point to the interconnectivity of the bilingual’s two lexicons. However, these results are based on studies which
present subjects with orthographic or auditory stimuli from both languages (van Wijnendaele & Brysbaert, 2002; Phillips et al., 2006). It is
unsurprising then that words in both languages are activated. The current study presents subjects with images of name-known objects as
primes followed by auditorily presented target words which were phonologically related, unrelated or identical to the label for the prime
image. ERPs to targets were measured to determine differences in activation across the different conditions. In the rhyming conditions, phonological similarity between prime images and target labels was
manipulated within (i.e. German prime, German target) and across (i.e.
English prime, German target) languages. Importantly, since the prime
is an image whose label subjects can generate in either of their languages, and the targets were only German words, this study presents
subjects with auditory stimuli from only one language. Nevertheless,
adult N400 amplitude revealed no differences in activation from prime
image-target labels that were related within and across languages. However, child N400 amplitude showed a differentiation of the rhyming conditions, although both conditions differed from the unrelated condition.
This provides strong evidence of interconnectivity of a bilingual’s two
lexicons as it develops, despite the study presenting subjects with stimuli
from only one language.

LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY MODULATES THE RECRUITMENT OF NONCLASSICAL LANGUAGE AREAS IN BILINGUALS Matthew K. Leonard1,

Christina Torres1, Katherine E. Travis1, Timothy T. Brown1, Donald J. Hagler Jr.1,
Anders M. Dale1, Jeffrey L. Elman1, Eric Halgren1; 1University of California, San
Diego — In a previous study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG)
constrained with MRI to study the organization of the first (L1) and second (L2) languages within the brains of bilinguals. We found that, compared to L1, L2 words evoke greater activity in right hemisphere and
bilateral posterior visual areas as early as ~135 ms, and that this activity
persists through lexico-semantic processing at ~400 ms (Leonard et al.,
2010). However, although these subjects began learning L2 at around 6
years old, they remained more proficient in L1, and it was unclear
whether proficiency or order of acquisition determined the extent of
bilateral posterior activity. Additionally, the occipito-temporal location
of the activity to L2 words could be related to the fact that words were
presented in a written form. In the present study, MEG was recorded in
16 Spanish-English bilinguals while they either read or listened to single
words and performed a size judgment task. The subjects were all dominant in English, which they began acquiring around age 6. Anatomical
MRI scans were acquired and used to constrain the MEG inverse solution to the cortical surface. Visual words evoked similar activity as in the
previous study, in that the less proficient language evoked greater activity in bilateral occipito-temporal secondary visual areas ~400 ms after a
word was shown. A similar pattern was observed for auditory words.
These findings suggest that proficiency plays a dominant role in the
recruitment of non-classical language areas, which appear to have supramodal responses to linguistic stimuli.

phologically complex words. The aim was also to compare the neural
processing of derived (e.g., sense+less) and inflected (e.g., sense+s)
words. Ten participants (native speakers) listened to morphologically
simple and complex Finnish words and judged their acceptability while
their electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography
(MEG) responses were recorded simultaneously. The event-related
potential (ERP) results showed that inflected words elicited a larger
LAN-type of negativity than derived and monomorphemic words
approximately 200 ms after the critical point (suffix onset or uniqueness
point). Equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling of MEG data showed
that this negativity was explained by two bilateral sources (four dipoles)
in the temporal cortex, with inflected words showing larger source
amplitudes than derived words. There were also significant differences
in the dipole locations between inflected and derived words. The current
results provide electrophysiological evidence for distinct neural sources
of spoken inflected and derived words. In general, the results support
the models of morphological processing that suggest that during the recognition of inflected words, the constituent morphemes are accessed
separately. The stem and suffix combination undergoes simultaneous
syntactic licensing and semantic integration of the morphemes. Regarding derived words, stem and suffix morphemes might be at least initially
activated along with the whole word representation.

ON THE INTERFACE OF PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY IN PROCESSING
OF COMPLEX WORDS Natalia Bekemeier1, Aditi Lahiri2, Carsten Eulitz1;
1

University of Konstanz, Germany, 2University of Oxford — How much detail

on word forms is stored in mental lexicon? The current EEG study asked
whether there is morphological decomposition of semantically transparent complex nouns (stem + derivational suffix). To explore this, we used
a fine-grained phonologically motivated violation of a stem vowel as
well as presence/absence of sentence context. The hypothesis was that
violation-related brain responses should depend on the type of stem violation and the presence of context. A set of spoken German nouns of the
type ‘adjectival stem + fronting + {ung}’ (e.g. Stark~Stärkung) was tested
in a word list experiment and a sentence context experiment with critical
items in final position. In the related derived (RD) condition, we preserved the adjectival stem (e.g. *Starkung), in the unrelated derived (UD)
condition a non-existing stem (e.g. *Sturkung) was used. Both violation
conditions elicited similar L(eft) A(nterior) N(egativity) and P600 effects
in the context experiment. Similar results were found in a cross-linguistic
comparison using English nouns of the type ‘adjectival stem + change of
height/tenseness + {ity}’ (e.g. sane~sanity). The word list experiment
showed a significant gradient brain response (control > RD > UD) in the
latency and topography of N400. This gradual pattern of N400 effect
gives evidence for morphological decomposition of complex words.
Moreover, our findings in the context experiments imply that contextually driven expectations induce repair mechanisms that convert violated
items into semantically meaningful strings. Thus, the LAN/P600 effects
support the idea that these repair mechanisms are purely morphosyntactic, i.e. morphological decomposition takes place.

Molfese3, Brian Gold4; 1University of Maryland at College Park, 2University of
Louisville, 3University of Nebraska at Lincoln, 4University of Kentucky at
Lexington — The Recognition Potential (Rudell, 1991), a left-lateralized

negativity that peaks at about 200-250 ms, is one of the most interesting
of the early latency ERP reading components. It is the first to consistently
display lexicality effects (larger for words vs. non-words) and possibly
semantic effects. It has therefore been suggested to reflect an early confluence of lexical and semantic processing (Martín-Loeches, 2007). The
lexicality effect seems to be largely invisible unless the stimuli are temporally flanked by masks at an SOA of about 250 ms (Iglesias et al.,
2004). It has been suggested that its generator is either the Visual Word
Form Area (Martín-Loeches, Hinojosa, Gómez-Jarabo, & Rubia, 2001) or

the Language Formulation Area (Dien, 2009), a portion of the posterior
inferior temporal gyrus (Nielsen, 1946) that has been reported to
respond to cloze probability of sentence stimuli (Dien et al., 2008). In this
experiment, twenty-three participants underwent the task while having
high-density 129-channel ERP data collected and a separate sample of
fifteen participants underwent the task while having fMRI data collected
in a 3T scanner. Examination of the ERP data confirmed that a standard
Recognition Potential effect was produced. The only corresponding
effect in the fMRI data was in the Language Formulation Area, confirming it as a more likely source for the Recognition Potential. Based on the
neuroanatomical location and the temporal information, it is suggested
that it may be a primary convergence point between the orthographic
and phonological pathways of reading comprehension.

ACOUSTIC AND CATEGORICAL EFFECTS OF AMERICAN ENGLISH FRONT

Idsardi3; 1Max-Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences,
Leipzig, Germany, 2Basque Center on Cognition, Brain, and Language, Spain,
3University of Maryland — The classification of vowels can rely on gradientacoustic distinctions (e.g. spectral characteristics) or on abstract-categorical distinctions (i.e. high vs. low vowels). We present data from a MEG
mismatch negativity (MMN) study that assesses both the processing of
gradient acoustic and categorical phonological information. Thus, we
tested the American English low, mid, and high front vowels [?], [?] and
[?], recording the neuromagnetic response to deviant vowels preceded
by a series of standard vowels. Based on previous work, we expect the
MMN amplitude to reflect categorical rather than acoustic differences
between standards and deviants. 15 participants passively listened to
multiple, acoustically distinct tokens of the front vowels, naturally produced by a female native speaker of American English. Brain activity
was recorded by a 157 channel whole-head axial gradiometer MEG system (KIT, Japan). We compared the brain responses to the low-mid pair
(i.e., [?]/[?] and [?]/[?]) and to the low-high pair (i.e., [?]/[?] and [?]/[?]),
assuming that the low-high pair should not elicit larger MMNs if the
response is dependent on categorical differences. In fact, the magnitude
of the MMN did not differ in amplitude between the contrast of low and
mid, and low and high vowels (t = 1.61, p = 0.11). Further, we found a
directional MMN asymmetry for the low-mid comparison, supporting
underspecification of the feature [mid]. Differences in N1m dipole
sources, on the other hand, preserved acoustic distances in vowel space.
We conclude that initial, more acoustic-based processing is rapidly followed by the evaluation of categorical vowel differences.

sphere to language processing is restricted to complex interpretive tasks
that require extending meaning beyond the literal senses of individual
words or sentences (e.g. figurative language, narratives, inferences, and
emotional tone). Neuropsychological studies consistently reveal impairments in these high-level language skills following right hemisphere
injury while reports of comprehension or production deficits at the level
of single words are exceedingly rare. The report of Neininger and Pulvermuller (2003) then that damage to right frontal cortex results in significantly impaired verb processing is especially surprising. The purpose of
the present study was to re-examine the assumption that the languagedominant left hemisphere is necessary and sufficient for normal naming
abilities by following up on this study with a more sensitive and rigorous approach. We tested thirty-four focal lesion patients (half with unilateral left hemisphere injury and half with unilateral right hemisphere
injury) on the Object and Action Naming Battery (Druks, 1992) and conducted Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM; Bates et al, 2003)
analysis to identify areas where damage significantly impaired naming
accuracy. Results of the VLSM analysis confirm that an intact left hemisphere is insufficient for accurate action naming. Even in the absence of

224

clinical aphasia, lesions to the right prefrontal and premotor cortex were
associated with mild but significant impairments in the ability to accurately name everyday actions. Results are discussed in terms of possible
deficits at the level of verb retrieval or semantics.

THE MISMATCH NEGATIVITY TO THE ENDING VOWEL CHANGE OF
PSEUDOSYLLABLES IN ADULTS AND PRESCHOOLERS Pei-wen Yeh1,2,

Yu-lin Tzeng1, Chia-Ying Lee1,2; 1Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica,
Taipei, Taiwan, 2National Yang Ming University, Taiwan — Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an ERP component that reflects a process of automatic discrimination of auditory information. In our previous study, MMN to
ending vowel (rime) changing in Mandarin syllable elicited in 100-250
ms in adults. However, the MMN can be replaced by the positive mismatch responses (P-MMR) in 4- to 5-year-old preschoolers. It is still
unclear whether the developmental transition from a positive wave to an
adult-like negative mismatch is affected by the neural maturation or by
the stimulus-related factor, such as the size of deviance. In addition, the
influence of meaning syllable could enhance the magnitude of MMN
(MMN enhancement; Pulvermüller et al., 2001). Therefore, the present
study aims to examine the mismatch responses to three meaningless syllables: tsi1, tsu1 and tse1, that share the same initial consonant /ts/ and
high level tone T1 but differ in the place of articulation of the ending
vowel in adults and preschoolers from 4 to 6 years old. The “tsi” serves
as the common standard and the “tsu” and “tse” were smaller and larger
deviants in the multiple oddball paradigm. The results showed that typical MMNs elicited in 150-250 ms in adults, but P-MMRs instead in 4- to
6-year-old preschoolers. The data suggested that both stimulus-related
and biological criteria affected the presence of P-MMR.

effects of
immersing an internationally adopted (IA) child into the new language
of the environment (LE) while ceasing his/her exposure to his/her first
language, the language of adoption (LA), are not fully understood. A
recent meta-analytic examination of language skills in IA children
reveals that IA children show poorer language performances during the
school-age years (and beyond) as opposed to their non-adopted peers
(Scott et al., in submission). To evaluate whether later language difficulties can be related to differences in phonemic system organization, we
investigated auditory MMN responses from five IA children (3 -5 years
old) adopted from China and exposed to LE for at least 2 years, and five
matched non-adopted monolingual English speaking children .Words
were presented in randomized order in passive listening oddball paradigms in three conditions. Chinese only phonemic feature (/maai5/
(buy ) & /maai6/(sell))based on tonal differences present in Mandarin
and not in English, English only phonemic feature not represented in
Mandarin (/mad/ vs. /mat/), and phonemic contrast evident in both
languages (/mad/ and /man/). MMN was derived from 32 channel
EEG recordings by averaging and montaging to fronto-central sensors
and subtraction of averaged standard responses from averaged deviant
responses within each condition. Enhanced MMN responses were
observed for tonal differences in IA children and not for the control
group. The English phonemic contrasts were associated with delayed
MMN responses for the IA group and not the control group. We propose
that these preliminary findings reveal differences in the phonological
representations in IA children.

IMPAIRED LEXICAL PROCESSING IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM
SPECTRUM DISORDERS AS REVEALED BY MISMATCH NEGATIVITY

Bettina Mohr1,2, Whitmore Antony1, Garagnani Max2, Pulvermuller
Friedemann2, Ludlow Amanda1; 1Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK,

Medical Research Council, Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge,
UK — Semantic processing problems are often seen among individuals
with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, it is still
unclear whether these deficits reflect impairments in language processing per se or whether they may be linked to or caused by problems in
auditory sensory processing, such as hyper- or hyposensitivity to sounds
and speech. This question was addressed in a multi-feature passive mismatch negativity paradigm (MMN) using speech standards as well as
frequency, loudness, length, word and pseudo-word deviants. 11 high
functioning children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders
(mean age 13.1 years) and 11 typically developing children (mean age
13.7 years) were matched for IQ and handedness. Behavioural correlates
of sensory perception were assessed with the Adolescence Sensory Profile. In ASD children, compared with typically developing children, we
found significantly reduced MMN amplitudes to loudness and word
deviants, but not to pseudo-word, frequency and length deviants. Further analyses showed that only word evoked MMN responses significantly correlated with impaired sensory processing in the ASD group.
As word-elicited MMN responses have previously been suggested to
reflect the activation of cortical memory circuits, we interpret the
reduced word-MMN as an indicator of weakened memory traces in
ASD, leading to impaired top-down processing.

SEGMENTING WORDS IN TWO LANGUAGES: ERP EVIDENCE FROM
MONOLINGUAL AND BILINGUAL INFANTS Debra Mills1, Caroline Junge2,

Theresa Wildegger1, Emily Guilhem1, Laura Talbot1, Natalie Ebanks1; 1Bangor
University, 2Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen — An important predictor of early language development is the ability to recognize
words from continuous speech. This is a non-trivial task even for infants
exposed to only one language. Infants learning trochaic languages use
the statistical regularities of the stress patterns of their native language to
facilitate word segmentation. Here, we examine the effects of learning
one or two trochaic languages, English and/or Welsh, which differ in the
salience of the first syllable on ERP indices of word segmentation.
Although both languages are stress-based, the difference between
stressed and unstressed syllables is more salient in English. Welsh typically has a short first vowel and a lengthened second syllable, providing
a syllable-based cue, and initial stress is a less reliable predictor of word
onset. In the present study, 32 10-month-olds exposed to only English or
both English and Welsh participated in the study. Infants were familiarized to 4 blocks of 8 English sentences containing a stress-initial bi-syllabic word followed by a test phase of 4 unique sentences, half
containing the familiarized word. Monolingual infants showed a leftnegativity at 400ms, followed by a late negative component (Nc). Similarly, bilinguals show a larger negativity to familiarized than unfamiliarized words over left frontal regions, but the onset of the ERP effect was
later. The results suggest that exposure to two languages with minimally
different rhythmic structures increases the difficulty of finding words in
the speech stream. Although bilinguals are capable of finding words in
continuous speech, they make take more time to do so.

to which domain general processes contribute to language development
is a central question in developmental science. Behavioral research suggests that memory development plays an important role in the rapid
vocabulary changes typically observed between 13- and 20-months. It

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

has been suggested that bilingual adults have improved working memory abilities compared to monolinguals as a function of increased frontal
lobe function. The present study tests the hypothesis that bilingual
infants will show enhanced sematic priming effects compared to monolingual infants as a result of improved working memory abilities. An
event-related potential (ERP) semantic priming paradigm was adapted
for use with infants to elicit the N400 component. Infant participants 14-,
17-, 20- and 30-months of age heard a word that was immediately followed by a picture. The word prime either named the subsequent picture (match) or was the name for another picture (mismatch). This
paradigm requires the infant to hold the word in mind and compare it to
the subsequent picture to show a priming effect. A larger N400 was
expected in trials where there was a mismatch between the word-picture
pair. Consistent with previous findings, the size of the N400 effect in
monolingual infants was linked to vocabulary size. That is, only more
experienced word learners showed an N400 effect. When holding vocabulary size constant, the bilingual infants showed a more mature N400
effect than monolingual infants across all ages. This enhanced N400
word-picture effect is interpreted as the result of increased working
memory abilities in bilingual infants.

EXPERIENCE-INDUCED CHANGES IN BRAIN STRUCTURES AND
FUNCTIONS: INFLUENCE OF LIFELONG BILINGUALISM Gigi Luk1, Ellen
Bialystok1,3, Fergus Craik1,2, Cheryl Grady1,2; 1Rotman Research Institute at
Baycrest, 2University of Toronto, 3York University — Structural and functional

brain changes have been reported as a result of behavioral training but
less research has examined the relation between such neurological
change and life experience. To examine one such experience, bilingualism, we studied 24 older adults with structural and functional MRI. Half
of the participants had lifelong bilingual experience on a daily basis since
childhood and the others were monolingual speakers of English. Participants in the two groups had comparable background, neuropsychological performance and gray matter volume. Using diffusion tensor
imaging, bilingual participants showed increased white matter integrity,
measured by fractional anisotropy (FA), in corpus callosum and parts of
the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi. This FA difference was primarily driven by lower radial diffusivity, indicating more intact myelination in the bilinguals. Resting-state functional data in these
participants were analyzed with seed connectivity using partial least
squares (seed-PLS), a multivariate technique that correlates brain activity in a seed voxel with activity in the rest of the brain. The seed was in
the left caudate, chosen from a meta-analysis examining bilingual language switching. Results revealed common and distinct regions showing
correlated brain activity with left caudate for monolinguals and bilinguals. The distinct regions uniquely expressed in bilinguals included left
hemisphere pre-SMA, middle cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. These findings show that lifelong bilingualism maintains white matter integrity in older adults and reveal different functional neural
networks at rest. These structural and functional changes may be the
neural underpinnings of the reported bilingual behavioral advantage in
executive functions.

PICTURE-SENTENCE VERIFICATION IN OLDER ADULTS: EVIDENCE FROM
ERPS Pia Knoeferle1, Marta Kutas2; 1Bielefeld University, 2University of
California San Diego — In a recent study, sentences implied the shape of an
object, which matched (vs. mismatched) the shape of an object on a subsequent picture. Participants verified whether the sentence mentioned
the object. Shape-matching (vs. mismatching) trials elicited faster
responses; mismatch effects were more pronounced, and response latencies delayed for older relative to younger adults. These results were
interpreted as older (vs. younger) adults constructing stronger situation
models (Dijkstra et al., 2004). We collected event-related brain potentials
(ERPs) as older participants (60-90 yrs) read subject-verb-object sentences, and sentence final response times (RTs) indicating whether or not
the verb matched a previously depicted action (e.g., gymnast-punching

225

Poster Session I — Tuesday, April 5, 3:00 - 5:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
vs. applauding). For mismatches (vs matches), RTs were longer, verb
N400s over centro-parietal scalp larger, and ERPs to the object noun
more negative, replicating findings on verb-action congruence in
younger adults (18-31 yrs, Knoeferle, Urbach, & Kutas, in press). In older
(-0.55) vs. younger (-1.51) adults, verb-action congruence N400 effects
were less pronounced. Reliable N400 congruence effects in older adults
were delayed and only reliable between 400-500 ms, and not - like for
younger adults - from 300-400 ms post verb onset. Sentence-finally, only
young adults showed a reliable congruence effect. Thus, in our task, too
older adults were slower to respond to mismatches, though their online
N400 effects were less pronounced than in the younger adults, undermining a simple account of strong situation models in the elderly.

MISMATCH RESPONSES TO MANDARIN LEXICAL TONE IN CHILDREN

Taiwan, 3Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan — An issue
still in debate is whether the children with specific language impairment
(SLI) have deficit in speech processing. This study aims to address this
question by using mismatch negativity (MMN) to index their ability in
discriminating lexical tones of Mandarin CV syllables in a multiple-deviant oddball paradigm. In which, T1 (yi1; high level contour, 10%) serves
a large deviants and T2 (yi2; high rising contour, 10%) serves as a small
deviant, were contrasted to a common standard T3 (yi3; low falling rising contour, 80%). Twelve children with SLI aged from 4 to 6 years old
and their age-matched controls participated in this study. The control
group exhibited an adult-like MMN between 100-250 msec to large deviant (T1/T3) and an attenuated and delayed MMN from 150 to 200 msec
to small deviant (T2/T3). However, children with SLI showed a delayed
MMN to large deviant (T1/T3) from 200 to 250 msec and a positive mismatch response to the small deviant (T2/T3) from 250 to 350 msec. The
data suggested children with SLI display a deficit in lexical tone discrimination, especially for the acoustic similar contrast, such as T2/T3. It
might serve as a neurophysiological marker for the early identification of
children with language or reading deficits.

DOES BEING BILINGUAL LEAD TO AN ADVANTAGE AT DECLARATIVE
MEMORY? Ingrid Finger1, Johanna Dagort Billig1, Laura Babcock2, Michael
T. Ullman2; 1Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 2Georgetown
University — Previous studies have generally shown bilingual advantages

in executive function over the lifespan. However, few studies have
examined the effects of bilingualism on other cognitive domains. Declarative memory is one domain that might be expected to show bilingual/
monolingual differences. Evidence suggests that this memory system
plays important roles in both first and second language (Ullman, 2001;
2005). The use of this memory system in two languages in bilinguals, as
compared to one in monolinguals, might thus possibly lead to the
greater development of declarative memory in bilinguals, due to their
greater language experience. To test this hypothesis, we examined
declarative memory with a recognition memory task in middle-aged and
elderly Brazilian monolingual speakers of Portuguese, and age- and education-matched Brazilian bilingual speakers of Portuguese and Hunsrückisch (a German dialect). In the encoding phase, subjects saw
pictures of real and made-up objects, and indicated whether or not each
was real. To test recognition, several minutes later they saw the same
items and matched foils, and indicated whether they had seen each item
earlier. To test longer-term retention, one day later subjects were again
presented with the target items, together with new matched foils, and
indicated whether they had seen each item the previous day. Preliminary analyses suggest that bilinguals were more accurate than monolinguals in both the recognition and retention phases, that is, at recognizing
the target items and rejecting the foils. The data suggest that cognitive

226

advantages of bilingualism may extend beyond executive function to
aspects of declarative memory.

AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN INTRA-INDIVIDUAL SPEECH
PROCESSING VARIABILITY Brian Taylor1, Daniel Roberts1, Carryl

Baldwin1; 1George Mason University — Event-related potentials (ERPs) have

frequently been used to assess age-related changes in the neurophysiological processing of language. Specifically, the amplitude of the ERP is
often compared between conditions or groups of interest. In constructing
ERPs, many recorded neurophysiologic responses are averaged together
to reduce the contribution of uncorrelated background EEG. However, if
variability in the timing of each potential on a trial-by-trial basis (i.e.,
“latency jitter”) is confounded with a variable of interest, then the presence of amplitude differences observed in the average ERP might not be
the result of genuine amplitude differences, but timing variability. We
examined what role latency jitter may play in the well-established observation of age-related changes in the processing of natural speech as
indexed by the N400. Older and younger adults were presented with
sentences that ended in either expected or unexpected final words. In
agreement with previous findings, a reduction in N400 amplitude was
observed in the older adults compared with the younger adults in
response to the unexpected final words. However, analyzing ERPs on a
single trial basis reveals the older adults to have significantly greater
within subject variability in N400 latency, in comparison to younger
adults. This increased intra-individual latency variability may contribute
to the smaller N400 amplitudes observed in each subject’s average ERP.
Age-related reductions in N400 amplitudes may indicate less precise
timing of neurological processes. Conversely, they may indicate that the
older brain exhibits greater specificity in the processing of individual
sentence stimuli. Future research will examine this issue.

A NEUROCOGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE ON SPECIFIC LANGUAGE
IMPAIRMENT: NEW EVIDENCE AND THE PROCEDURAL DEFICIT
HYPOTHESIS Mariel Y. Pullman1, Elizabeth I. Pierpont2, Michael T. Ullman1;

1Georgetown University, 2University of Wisconsin-Madison — In
2005 we
advanced a brain-based conceptualization of Specific Language Impairment (SLI), a developmental disorder affecting language that occurs in
about 5% of children. We proposed that SLI can be largely explained by
abnormalities of brain structures underlying the procedural memory
system, in particular frontal/basal-ganglia circuits, especially in Broca’s
region and the caudate nucleus (Ullman & Pierpont, 2005). We argued
that this pattern of brain abnormalities, which may be caused by various
etiologies, results in deficits of the diverse language and non-language
functions that depend on these neural substrates – including procedural
memory, working memory, motor function, grammar, and lexical
retrieval – but that declarative memory and its neural substrates remain
largely unaffected. We also suggested that heterogeneity in the exact
locus and extent of the neural abnormalities leads to much of the behavioral heterogeneity observed in SLI. Since 2005, a new body of brain and
behavioral research has emerged that tests this Procedural Deficit
Hypothesis (PDH). Here, we present a review of this recent evidence,
focusing on neuroimaging and ERP studies, as well as a range of behavioral experiments examining procedural memory, declarative memory
and other functions. We present a quantitative analysis of the proportion
of SLI samples, across all studies, that have shown abnormalities of
major cortical and subcortical brain structures. Overall, the evidence
supports the PDH and suggests further theoretical refinements as well as
avenues for future research. We discuss implications for behavioral heterogeneity, co-morbidity with ADHD and other disorders, and therapeutic interventions.

ADHD AND LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT: A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON
COMORBIDITY Kaitlyn M. Tagarelli1, Mariel Y. Pullman1, Michael T.

Ullman1; 1Georgetown University — Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-

der (ADHD), the most common developmental disorder in children, cooccurs with language deficits at rates as high as 90%. Various accounts
have been posited for the high comorbidity of ADHD with language
impairments (including Specific Language Impairment; SLI), such as a
lack of causality between the disorders, and language problems being
caused by attention problems. While these and other explanations may
help partially account for the comorbidity, we argue that they are not
sufficient. We suggest a new hypothesis: abnormalities in frontal/basalganglia and/or frontal/cerebellar circuits in ADHD not only affect those
portions of the circuitry responsible for the core deficits of ADHD, but
also tend to extend to other, parallel, portions of the circuitry, including
those involved in language – specifically, those portions involved in
grammar (posited to depend on the circuitry underlying procedural
memory) and those parts underlying lexical retrieval (thought to depend
on nearby circuitry). That is, just as Ullman and Pierpont (2005) posit
that SLI is not specific to language, we posit that ADHD is not necessarily specific to attention or hyperactivity. To test this hypothesis, we
present a review of evidence from a wide range of neural and behavioral
studies of ADHD. Overall, the evidence supports the predictions of this
novel hypothesis for ADHD, which can be viewed as an extension of the
Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH) proposed for SLI. Finally, we make
a number of testable predictions for future research, and suggest that the
PDH is a useful paradigm for the further study of ADHD.

MATURATION OF MISMATCH RESPONSES TO MANDARIN LEXICAL
TONES IN PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN En-ju Lin1, Wan-hsuan Lin1, Yu-

lin Tzeng1, Pei-wen Yeh1, Chia-ying Lee1; 1Institute of Linguistics, Academia
Sinica — Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a change-specific component of
auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited in passive oddball paradigm. In adults, MMN is generally a frontocentral negativity elicited
between 150 and 250ms after the onset of the deviant stimuli. However,
it was also found that MMN could be replaced by a frontal positive
response when measured in infants and preschool children. The change
of the polarity of the mismatch responses has been suggested a developmental transition affected by both neuronal maturation and the stimulus-related factors such as the size of deviance. As follow-up, present
study further examined whether the turning point of the polarity could
be found during elementary school stage with regard to lexical tone
changes. With the participation of more than 80 native Chinese students
across 6 grades (aged from 7 to 13 years old), two deviants, high level T1
and high rising T2 (10% each), were contrasted with a common low falling-rising standard T3 (80%) in a multi-deviants oddball paradigm. In
consistent with previous observation, the mismatch responses for the
acoustically dissimilar contrast of T1/T3 showed an adult-like MMN
across the grades. As for the acoustically similar contrast of T2/T3, a
positive mismatch response was observed in the case of lower grades
whereas data from higher grade students started to show a smaller in
amplitude yet negative response. Furthermore, the transition in polarity
was clearer when grouping the participants according to literacy, suggesting that the maturation of MMN might also be affected by the familiarity of the language.

POSTERIOR PERISYLVIAN PARIETAL ANATOMY IN BOYS WITH AUTISM
SPECTRUM DISORDER Tracey Knaus1, Helen Tager-Flusberg2, Anne
Foundas1; 1Louisisana State University Health Sciences Center, 2Boston
University — The right hemisphere is specialized for spatial attention,

emotion and pragmatics; the left hemisphere is specialized for tool use
and expressive language functions. The anterior (APR) and posterior
(PPR) parietal regions, demarcated by the end of the horizontal ramus of
the Sylvian fissure are asymmetric: larger left APR, and larger right PPR.

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

Disrupted lobar volume and asymmetry in individuals with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) may be associated with aberrant inter-hemispheric specialization. This deficit may be associated with aberrant morphology in these posterior perisylvian parietal regions. To examine this
hypothesis, 30 right-handed boys with ASD and 30 typically developing
boys, matched on age (7-14 years), handedness, and non-verbal IQ, were
studied. The APR was larger in the left hemisphere (F1,58 = 19.08, p <
.001) and the PPR was larger in the right hemisphere (F1,58 = 5.23, p =
.022), with no group differences. Structure-function relationships differed between the groups. In controls, there was a negative correlation
between right PPR volume and verbal IQ (r = -.377, p = .040). In the ASD
group, there was a negative correlation of the APR asymmetry quotient
with verbal IQ (r = -.411, p = .024) and a positive correlation between
right and left APR volumes (r = .403, p = .033). These results suggest that
there are different inter- and intra-hemispheric anatomical-behavioral
relationships in boys with ASD. These results support the hypothesis
that differential development of the cerebral hemispheres in ASD may be
associated with aberrant inter-hemispheric specializations that reflect
different processing strategies.

already possess the universal ability to discriminate phonemes of different languages. With increasing exposure to those phonemes relevant for
their native language this universal ability decreases in the course of language acquisition. The present study aimed at investigating the development of this discrimination ability in the first six months of life by means
of neuroscientific methods. The focus was set on phonotactic regularities. These are prelexical cues which describe the possible combination of
phonemes in a specific language. They are important for segmenting an
acoustic speech stream and play a crucial role during word learning. We
studied newborns, 3 and 6 months old infants by means of the simultaneous measurement of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results showed that already
at 3 months of age - but also at 6 months - infants are able to distinguish
native from non-native phonotactic rules. This was observable in the
EEG in a stronger frontal negativity and in the fNIRS in a stronger activation for native in contrast to non-native phonotactic rules. The fNIRS
effect was bilaterally distributed over frontal areas at that age. This latter
finding indicates that neuronal lateralization may establish at a later time
during language development.

LEARNING OBJECT NAMES ACTIVATES THE VISUAL WORD FORM AREA
MORE THAN LEARNING TO READ: EVIDENCE FROM FMRI Jo S H Taylor1,

Kathleen Rastle2, Matthew H Davis1; 1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
Cambridge, UK, 2Royal Holloway University of London, London, UK — Dehaene
and colleagues propose that the left fusiform gyrus (LFG) contains a specialised visual word form area (VWFA) representing abstract orthographic units. Conversely, Price and others argue that the LFG processes
visual objects as well as words, attributing word-specific responses to
task-related top-down modulation. Differences between these two tasks
should be greatest during learning: words must be decoded using systematic spelling-sound mappings whereas objects must be arbitrarily
associated with their names. We combine an artificial language paradigm with fMRI, providing a unique opportunity to explore ventral-temporal specialisation whilst learning novel words and objects. Twenty
healthy adults learned new names for 24 novel objects and to read 24
new words written in novel symbols, whilst in an MRI scanner. Learning
consisted of interleaved phases of training (paired visual and spoken
forms) and testing (read words/name objects). Participants learned the

227

Poster Session I — Tuesday, April 5, 3:00 - 5:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
trained items (words-69% correct, objects-68% correct) and generalized
their orthographic knowledge to untrained words (62% correct). Relative
to unimodal listening or viewing, cross-modal associative learning of
spoken words paired with objects and novel written words activated
bilateral superior parietal cortices, fusiform gyri and left hippocampus
(p<.01 whole-brain corrected). The LFG (overlapping with VWFA) was
more active when learning object-name associations than when learning
to read words. The reverse contrast revealed activation in bilateral superior parietal cortices. The fact that the LFG was less involved in learning
a new orthography than in learning new object-label associations challenges the idea that this region is specialised for word reading.

ERP MASKED REPETITION PRIMING EFFECTS IN CHILDREN Marianna

Eddy1, Priya Mitra2, John Gabrieli1, Jonathan Grainger3, Phillip Holcomb2;
Institute of Technology, 2Tufts University, 3CNRS and AixMarseille University — Masked priming is the "gold-standard" paradigm
1Massachusetts

for examining visual word recognition in adult readers. Previous behavioral studies have demonstrated reliable masked repetition priming
effects can be obtained in children, suggesting that this approach might
be useful for probing visual word recognition developmentally. Recently
our group has enhanced the temporal resolution of the masked priming
paradigm in adults by combining it with the recording of event-related
potentials (ERPs). However, to date, ERP studies have not examined the
neural time course of these effects in children. The current study examined masked repetition priming in a group of children 8 to 12 years old,
manipulating stimulus repetition and duration of prime stimulus presentation. The prime stimulus was presented for 53, 80 or 107 ms with a
constant stimulus onset asynchrony of 120 ms. Consistent with adult
masked repetition priming ERP literature, we found a cascade of priming effects including the N250 and N400, with effects tending to be stronger at the longer prime duration. These results suggest in proficient,
young readers, a similar mechanism to that of adults is used access
orthographic and semantic information. However, the priming effects
were less robust at shorter priming durations suggesting some developmental differences in proficient reading children compared to adults.

EMERGENCE OF VISUAL CORTEX PLASTICITY IN CONGENITALLY BLIND
CHILDREN Marina Bedny1, Hilary Richardson1, Lindsay Yazzolino2, Helen

Pu1, Rebecca Saxe1; 1Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2Brown
University — Congenitally blind adults activate left visual cortices during
language comprehension. This occipital activation extends into primary
visual cortex (pericalcarine cortex). We asked when during the course of
development visual brain regions take on language functions. Ten
totally blind children between the ages of four and sixteen took part in
an fMRI study. Nine of the children were blind from birth and one participant became totally blind at age five. Fifteen age-matched sighted
children also took part in the study as control participants. During the
study, participants listened to brief stories (20 seconds). After each story,
children were asked: “Does this come next?” Then the child either heard
a sentence describing the completion of that story or an unrelated sentence from a different story (3 seconds). Participants made a yes or no
response (6.5 seconds). In two control conditions children performed the
same task based on sound similarity with 1) stories in foreign languages
and 2) music sequences. In congenitally blind children, we observed
increased occipital activity for stories relative to music. However, relative to our prior studies with blind adults, occipital activity was reduced
in extent and predominantly found in secondary visual regions in the
fusiform gyrus and later occipitotemporal cortex, rather than in the primary visual cortex. These data suggest that occipital areas are recruited
for higher cognitive functions in early childhood, possibly beginning
with higher-order visual areas.

priming effects has provided unique insight into the time-course of automatic visual word recognition. Masked priming produces robust sublexical (N250) and lexico-semantic (N400) effects in the ERPs of fluent adult
readers. Since reading is a learned skill, these priming effects must
develop over time as the brain acquires the ability to read. Here we
explored developmental and individual differences resulting from different levels of reading expertise. Electrophysiological data from collegeand elementary-aged typical readers were recorded in a forward- and
backward-masked repetition priming paradigm. Standardized behavioral reading measures were also administered to determine individual
proficiency in reading-related skills. Correlations between behavioral
and ERP priming measures revealed that the amplitude of N250 priming
effect was largest at posterior midline sites in adults who had higher
scores on one measure of phonological awareness. Analyses of data from
developing readers revealed a similar relationship with the size of N250
priming showing a significant positive correlation with phonological
awareness at central and posterior sites. The N400 priming effect showed
significant positive correlations with number naming speed in both
groups. Together these data suggest that ERP masked priming measures
may be a sensitive predictor of reading-related subskills in both children
and adults.

While exemplars of the same speech token cluster into a single category
(i.e., within-category), exemplars of different speech tokens cluster into
separate categories (i.e., between-categories). A previous study in our lab
found that bilinguals’ age of acquisition (AOA) and proficiency level
(PL) differentially predict the discrimination of within- and betweencategories in a second language. The current fMRI study is an extension
of our behavioral findings. The main goal is to investigate how AOA and
PL predict the detection of sounds in second language (L2) when these
are discriminated as same (within-category) or different (between-category). A total of 83 subjects participated in this study (17 monolinguals
and 66 Spanish-English bilinguals – 34 early and 32 late). In a passive listening task, participants watched a muted movie clip of “planet earth”
while pairs of L2 syllables (saf, sof, suf) played through the MRI headphones. Proficiency scores were obtained in each language. The results
from a multiple regression analysis showed that early acquisition activates brain areas associated with categorization of speech and earlyauditory processing, including the inferior frontal gyrus and superior
temporal gyrus. On the other hand, high proficiency activates brain
areas involved in sensory integration, monitoring, and novelty response
detection including the superior and inferior parietal lobule, the posterior cingulate gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus. Our data indicates
that different neural systems play a role in the detection of non-native
within- or between- category sounds depending on the age of acquisition
and proficiency level.

have not been systematically compared in the same subjects. We
recruited participants with a wide range of reading abilities (from dyslexics to very good readers) and used fMRI to measure a variety of neural markers that have previously been shown to predict reading ability
(e.g., right cerebellar activity during a motor sequence task, left occipitotemporal and left temporoparietal activity during phonological processing, activity in area MT/MT+ during a motion processing task). We then
correlated each neural marker with reading ability as assessed by the
Woodcock-Johnson III Reading Inventory (WJ-III) and the Test of Word
Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) in order to evaluate the predictive power
of each marker. Preliminary data suggest that cerebellum activation during motor sequence execution and activation in the reading network
during phonological processing are good neural predictors of reading
fluency and word decoding, whereas MT/MT+ activation during
motion processing is a good neural predictor of passage comprehension.
Complete results from a larger sample of subjects will be presented and
discussed. Supported by NIH grant R21HD064983 to T.A.P.

AGE-RELATED CHANGES IN DECISION-MAKING INFLUENCE OPTIMAL
COMMUNICATION Corey McMillan1, Robin Clark1, Michael Dreyfuss1,
Murray Grossman1; 1University of Pennsylvania — Individuals

can optimize
communication by minimizing ambiguities. For example, instead of
speaking a homonym (e.g., “pen”) individuals can use an unambiguous
alternative (e.g., “animal cage”). McMillan et al (submitted) observed
that young adults who optimize communication recruit a decision-making network that includes a probabilistic mechanism (“what is the likely
meaning of ‘pen’?”) in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC), a riskevaluation mechanism (will ‘pen’ be misinterpreted?”) in orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC), and an integration mechanism in inferior parietal cortex
(IPC). Healthy seniors have limitations with decision-making due to agerelated cortical changes in DLPFC and OFC. In this study we used fMRI
in young adults (YNG) and healthy seniors (HS) to investigate how
changes in decision-making mechanisms influence optimal communication. Participants performed a sentence-completion task (“He needed a
__.”) by choosing a homophone (“pen”) or an unambiguous synonym
(“cage”) after reading a sentence biased toward the dominant (“Tony has
ink”) or subordinate meaning (“Tony has pigs”). YNG chose more
unambiguous synonyms than HS in both the dominant and subordinate
contexts (p<0.05); YNG chose more unambiguous synonyms in the subordinate than the dominant context while HS selections did not differ
across contexts. An fMRI analysis revealed that YNG recruited a decision-making network relative to HS, including DLPFC, OFC and IPC,
while HS only recruited anterior cingulate relative to YNG. These behavioral results suggest that HS have limitations optimizing communication, and fMRI evidence suggests this limitation is due to reduced
recruitment of a decision-making network. We conclude that decisionmaking mechanisms contribute importantly to optimizing communication.

University of Iowa — Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a developmental disorder that affects language, especially grammar. However, SLI is
also associated with deficits of non-linguistic functions such as motor
skills. The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH; Ullman & Pierpont,
2005) proposes that SLI can be largely explained by abnormalities of
brain structures in the procedural memory system. This system, which is
rooted in frontal/basal-ganglia circuits, may be specialized for the

implicit learning of rules and sequences, in both motor and cognitive
domains, including grammar. The PDH predicts procedural learning
deficits. To test this, we gave the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task
(ASRT; Howard & Howard, 1997) to 27 language-impaired (mean age
10) and 22 age-matched typically-developing children, none of whom
had ADHD or other co-morbid developmental disorders. Subjects performed the task for four epochs (each 5 blocks of 80 trials) on one day.
Retention was examined on a subsequent day with a single epoch.
Learning was operationalized as a two-way interaction between Epoch
(1-5) and Triplet-Frequency (high/low): learning should be reflected by
an increasing difference in performance between high- and low-frequency triplet-sequences. Holding performance IQ constant in an
ANCOVA, group differences in learning were observed (Epoch x Triplet-Frequency x Group interaction), due to learning between epochs 1
and 5 in the typically-developing but not the language-impaired children. The data suggest that procedural learning deficits in languageimpaired children might in some cases be apparent only after a delay,
perhaps due to consolidation differences. The results support the PDH,
and suggest further refinements to the hypothesis.

ATTENTIONAL FOCUS DURING LEARNING IMPACTS N170
LATERALIZATION TO NOVEL VISUAL WORD FORMS Yuliya
Yoncheva1,
Jessica Wise1, Bruce McCandliss1; 1Vanderbilt University — Reading instruc-

tion can highlight different unit sizes in print-to-speech mappings, ranging from whole words to grapheme-phoneme relationships within
words. Thus, attentional focus on specific unit sizes during learning
might influence the neural mechanisms recruited later in skilled reading,
as indexed by the characteristically left-lateralized N170 event-related
potential (ERP) response. The present study tested this hypothesis by
training literate adults in an artificial writing system consisting of word
characters (glyphs) containing embedded letters. Subjects learned to
associate sets of auditory English words with corresponding glyphs
under two instruction conditions. For one set, participants were
instructed to focus on linking entire characters to whole auditory words
(whole-word focus); for another set, they were instructed to focus on
linking the embedded letters to the vowels and consonants within the
auditory words (grapheme-phoneme focus). Following training, ERPs to
both sets of glyphs were recorded during a reading verification task.
Glyphs trained under grapheme-phoneme focus elicited a more left-lateralized N170 topography relative to the right-lateralized N170 topography observed in response to glyphs trained under whole-word focus.
These results demonstrate that focusing learners’ attention on certain
unit size mappings can impact the neural circuitry subsequently
recruited by specific stimuli during reading. The current findings support the notion that attentional focus plays a key role in early reading
acquisition.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF THE COMPREHENSION OF
NOVEL MEANINGS: CONTRASTING OXYMORA AND PLEONASMS Nicola

Molinaro1, Manuel Carreiras1,2, Jon Andoni Duñabeitia1; 1BCBL, Basque
center on Cognition, Brain and Language, 2Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for
Science — In this study we evaluate novel meanings comprehension pro-

cesses. Oxymora are figures of speech in which two words whose meaning is paradoxical are merged. The most common form of oxymoron
involves adjective-noun combinations (e.g. cold fire or real dream).
While oxymora are literally paradoxical, pleonasms are noun-adjective
pairs in which similar meanings are redundantly expressed (burning
fire). In a first ERP experiment 20 participants were visually presented
with word by word Spanish sentences containing noun-adjectives Oxymora (Estaba completamente confusa por el sueño real de la noche anterior. - I was completely confused by the real dream from last night),
compared to literally Neuter sentences (funny dream) and semantic Vio-

lations (!expert dream). The Violation condition elicited an enhanced
N400 compared to the other two conditions, that did not differ around
400 ms. The Oxymoron condition elicited a larger frontal positive effect
(500-900 ms) compared to the other conditions. In a second experiment
20 Spanish speakers read sentences containing Pleonasms (unreal
dream; plus Neuter and Violation). While Pleonasms and Neuter sentences did not differ around 400 ms the Violation caused a N400 effect.
The Pleonasm elicited a short-living (500-650 ms) increased frontal positive component compared the other conditions. The two experiments
suggest that understanding oxymora requires more than the simple activation and combination of semantic features (mirrored in the N400).
Only after this initial semantic analysis, related concepts are integrated
in activating novel meanings: while pleonasms trigger short-living late
positivities, oxymora trigger long-lasting positivities.

CEREBRAL ASYMMETRIES IN THE GENERATION OF LITERAL VERSUS
FIGURATIVE MEANINGS Natalie A. Kacinik1, Rita El-Haddad1, Benjamin A.

Cooley1; 1Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center, City University of New
York — There are indications that the right hemisphere (RH) is preferentially involved in processing figurative language (e.g., Anaki et al., 1998;
Klepousniotou & Baum, 2005; Schmidt et al., 2007), but many studies
have failed to find evidence of this preferential RH involvement (e.g.,
Coulson & Van Petten, 2007; Kacinik & Chiarello, 2007; Rapp et al., 2004).
In normal, non brain-injured participants, the vast majority of this
research has investigated the processing of figurative expressions, particularly the activation and integration of their meaning, using comprehension paradigms. The present study used visual half-field
presentation and a word generation procedure to examine hemispheric
differences in the generation and production of literally versus figuratively related nouns in response to adjectives with a literal and figurative
sense. The typically robust processing advantage for words presented to
the right visual field left hemisphere (RVF/LH) was not obtained, in
accordance with previous work by Chiarello et al. (2006) suggesting that
the RH may be important for generating and maintaining the activation
of potential word responses. Furthermore, classification of these
responses indicated that participants were more likely to generate figuratively related words in response to stimuli in the LVF/RH, whereas
words presented to the RVF/LH were more likely to result in literal
responses. These findings thus support the RH figurative language
hypothesis because, although the RH may not be the preferred substrate
for understanding figurative expressions, it does appear to be important
in generating, and hence ultimately producing, figuratively related
words.

“FOR TO EVERYONE WHO HAS, MORE SHALL BE GIVEN”: SEMANTIC
RICHNESS ENHANCES IMPLICIT WORD LEARNING Milena Rabovsky1,

Werner Sommer1, Rasha Abdel Rahman1; 1Humboldt University (Berlin) —
Words differ considerably in the amount of associated semantic information. Despite the crucial role of meaning in language, it is still unclear
whether and how this variability modulates language learning. Here, we
provide initial evidence demonstrating that the amount of semantic features associated with a given word influences implicit learning in repetition priming. Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained while
participants performed a visual lexical decision task; the complete stimulus set was repeated once. Repetition priming effects on performance
accuracy and the N400 component of the event-related brain potential
were enhanced for words with many semantic features. These findings
suggest a novel and important impact of the richness of semantic representations on learning and plasticity within the lexical-conceptual system.

AUDITORY CORTICAL ACTIVITY DURING SUSTAINED AUDITORY
ATTENTION Novraj Dhanjal1, Jane Warren1, Richard Wise1; 1Imperial
College London — Successful encoding of heard factual sentences depends
on sustained auditory attention while listening to an entire sentence.
This results in greater understanding of the meaning of messages conveyed, strengthening encoding to episodic memory. Studies of selective
auditory attention in both humans and animals have attributed enhancement of activity in auditory cortex to attention. However, studies of sustained auditory attention in rats have demonstrated suppression of
activity in primary auditory cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance
imaging on 31 healthy adults, we investigated the response of human
auditory cortex during sentence encoding. Subsequent recall performance was used as a marker of sustained auditory attention during
encoding. Sentences that were most accurately recalled were associated
with relative suppression of activity in primary auditory cortex during
encoding. This was accompanied by greater activity in cortical regions
associated with processing for verbal meaning (semantics). By contrast,
the greatest auditory activity was associated with task-dependent
focused attention on single words during a task designed to prevent subvocal rehearsal of sentences, despite lower rates of presentation of auditory stimuli than in sentence encoding task. We have therefore
demonstrated that although focused attention to individual verbal stimuli enhances activity in early auditory cortex, different levels of sustained auditory attention when understanding sentences have
counterintuitive modulatory influences on auditory cortical function.
These findings have implications for research on patients with diffuse
neurodegenerative diseases, whose verbal memory impairment may be
consequential to an inability to sustain auditory attention across sentences, in addition to disordered language and memory systems.

SPATIO-TEMPORAL INTEGRATION OF WRITTEN WORDS DURING

Psychologie et Neurocognition, UMR CNRS 5105, Université Pierre MendèsFrance, Grenoble, 2Inserm, U836, Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences,
Grenoble, Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France — The goal of this

study was to assess the spatio-temporal integration of written word
using EEG source localization. The temporal lobe is the main candidate
for the integration of written words, from shape analysis to lexicality discrimination. EEG and MEG studies have shown that the workflow of
information processing occurs between 150 and 400 ms after stimulus
onset. Here, fifteen healthy subjects performed phoneme detection and
semantic categorization tasks. EEG activity was recorded with 96 active
electrodes. Reconstruction of sources was subsequently performed on
the event-related potentials (ERP) using SPM8. To limit inter-individual
variability, we used a group-based reconstruction scheme that constrains
the sources to be identical for all subjects. ERP showed significant taskrelated differences on left temporal electrodes between 200 ms and 300
ms peri-stimulus time, ERP amplitude for semantic task being stronger
than for phonological task. After source localization, it was possible to
identify two cortical regions responsible for ERP differences: the inferoposterior temporal gyrus (BA 37) from 200 to 250 ms and the anterior
temporal gyrus from 250 to 300 ms. Our results confirm that spatio-temporal integration of word processing involves the left temporal lobe.
They also suggest that activation of word processing moves from posterior (lexicality access) to anterior (semantic retrieval) regions of the left
temporal lobe.

when a word is preceded by a supportive context such as a semantically
associated word or a predictive sentence frame. An ongoing question is
the degree to which this reduction reflects passive memory mechanisms
as opposed to active predictions about upcoming material. To address
this question, we used a priming paradigm that made it possible to modulate prediction without changing the critical context. Semantically associated prime-target pairs were embedded within an experimental
context that differentially encouraged active prediction. In the first block
of the experiment, only 10% of prime-target pairs were semantically
associated, while in the second block, 50% were associated. Participants
monitored filler probe words (always preceded by an unrelated prime)
for a particular semantic category. If the N400 priming effect is partially
driven by active prediction, the effect should be larger in the 50% context. Indeed, we found a larger N400 reduction for associated targets in
predictive than non-predictive blocks. The N400 to non-associated targets was not modulated by contextual prediction. These results are consistent with the view that N400 modulation can reflect active predictions
about upcoming stimuli, but that its modulation is driven primarily by
predictive facilitation, rather than costs of unfulfilled prediction. However, longer reaction times and a larger late posterior positivity were
observed on probe words in predictive relative to non-predictive blocks,
i.e. in cases of response conflict. These findings suggest that the benefits
and costs of semantic prediction are partially independent.

SEMANTIC NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECTS FOR CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT
WORDS Rutvik Desai1, Usha Tadimeti2, Jeffrey Binder1; 1Medical College of

Wisconsin, 2Marquette University — We examined semantic neighborhood
effects on word recognition in an fMRI study, using both association and
similarity measures of neighborhood. Twenty-two subjects performed a
lexical decision task for fifty concrete and abstract words. We examined
the following variables obtained from the Florida Free Association
Norms and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): Set Size (SS – number of
associated words), Mean Connectivity (MC – mean association between
the neighbors), Probability of Resonance (PR – probability of mutual
connectivity between the word and its neighbors), Semantic Density (SD
– average distance to the closest 50 words in the LSA space). For concrete
words, SS was positively correlated with activation in the left (L) middle
and inferior temporal (MTG/ITG) and angular gyri. MC was positively
correlated with L MTG/ITG, and negatively with right supramarginal
gyrus (SMG) and inferior precentral gyrus activation. PR was positively
correlated with L SMG and postcentral gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), cuneus, pars opercularis, and dorsal anterior temporal
lobe (ATL) activation. SD was positively correlated with L pars triangularis/orbitalis and posterior superior temporal gyrus activation. For
abstract words, MC was positively correlated with L mid/anterior STS,
and SD was positively correlated with L dorsal ATL activation. The
results suggest partially distinct networks involved in processing semantic associations for concrete and abstract words, with involvement of the
ATL in both. Involvement of anterior inferior parietal regions previously
associated with action planning suggests automatic activation of action
associations for concrete words.

TOOL, FOOD, OR ANIMAL? FMRI INDEXES OF SEMANTIC NOUN
CATEGORIES Francesca Carota1, Rachel Moseley1, Bettina Mohr1, Olaf

Hauk1, Friedemann Pulvermüller1; 1MRC-Cognition and Brain Science Unit —
As most words are used to speak about objects in the world, the processing of word meaning is typically related to the ventral visual stream of
object processing in temporal cortex, where previous studies have
shown general along with category-specific semantic activation, for
example distinguishing between animals and tools. We here compare
event-related fMRI responses to three different object-related word categories, namely tool, food and animal words, which were closely matched
for psycholinguistic properties and carefully evaluated with regard to
sensorimotor and abstract semantic dimensions. Food and tool words,
but not animal words, imply semantic knowledge about actions per-

formed on referent objects; correspondingly, left-precentral activation of
the motor system was found for these items, dominating in face and
hand areas for food and tool words, respectively. This result is reminiscent of semantic somatotopy shown earlier for action verbs. Consistent
with their motor connotations, tool words also activated right cerebellar
areas. Food words sparked left-orbitofrontal cortex, possibly reflecting
aspects of their emotional-affective meaning, along with left–inferiortemporal and –fusiform cortex. Activity to animal words tended to dominate in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in a right-inferior-temporal (or
possibly cerebellar) area. These results provide evidence for both dorsal
and ventral stream activation in cortex, along with cerebellar dynamics,
for objet-related words, documenting general word-elicited along with
category-specific semantic processes. Category-specific semantic foci
can, in part, be understood as brain manifestations of aspects of referential word meaning. Supported by MRC

SELECTIVE REDUCTION OF VERBAL ASSOCIATIONS IN PRIMARY
PROGRESSIVE APHASIA: AN ERP STUDY Robert S. Hurley1, Ken A.

Paller1, Christina A. Wieneke1, Joseph F. Boyle1, M. Marsel Mesulam1;
1Northwestern University — A number of neurodegenerative diseases result
in language impairment. When this impairment is the salient aspect of
the disease, and is initially not accompanied by decline in other cognitive
domains, a diagnosis of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is applied.
Aphasia in a subset of these patients is characterized by deficits in comprehension of nouns, usually accompanied by selective atrophy in the
temporal pole. There is current debate as to whether these semantic PPA
(PPA-S) patients have a core impairment in an amodal system underlying both object and word knowledge, or whether impairment resides
primarily in the language system. In the current experiment, 24 controls
and 7 PPA-S patients were shown picture primes followed by either picture or word targets, and were asked to make match/nonmatch judgments in response to each pair. Event-related potentials (ERPs) reveal the
extent of predictive encoding of targets as set up by the degree of semantic congruity with the preceding prime. Controls and PPA-S patients
showed P250 and N400 ERPs to target items. Whereas P250/N400 effects
were equivalent between groups on picture-to-picture trials, effects were
diminished in PPA-S patients on picture-to-word trials. These results
demonstrate that dysfunction in PPA-S is selectively greater in verbal
compared to non-verbal modalities, inconsistent with the view of an
amodal conceptual deficit. It is unknown whether patients with the
closely-related syndrome of semantic dementia, who may have more
prominent object recognition deficits (agnosia), would also show abnormal ERPs on picture-to-picture trials.

CONNECTIVITY WITHIN LANGUAGE NETWORK WAS MODULATED BY

Chen4, Marcel Bastiaansen2,3, Suiping Wang1; 1South China Normal
University, 2Radboud University Nijmegen, 3Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics, 4Chinese University of Hong Kong — Connectivity among
language-related brain regions during resting state has consistently been
observed in previous studies. The current study investigates whether
and how this connectivity is altered by a language task. Twenty-four
native Dutch speakers were asked to read sentences for comprehension
(i.e., a 50 min. language comprehension task), and resting state fMRI
data were collected before and after the task. In accordance with previous similar work (Xiang, Fonteijn, Norris, & Hagoort. (2010). Topographical functional connectivity pattern in the perisylvian language
networks. Cerebral Cortex, 20, 549-560.), ROIs in left BA44, BA45 and
BA47 were used as seed regions. Functional connectivity (fc) of the seed
regions with left parietal and temporal areas was found, in line with
Xiang et al’s observations. Moreover, comparing fc's before and after the
task, we found that the task altered fc patterns. After the task, for ROI
BA44 and BA45, reduced connectivity with middle and posterior temporal regions as well as with the parietal lobule were found. In contrast, we

231

Poster Session I — Tuesday, April 5, 3:00 - 5:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
observed increased connectivity with medial frontal and superior frontal
gyrus. For BA47, increased connectivity with anterior temporal lobe and
bilateral precentral gyrus, and reduced connectivity with visual cortex
were observed. Together the results suggest that language tasks modulate the resting-state connectivity within the brain's language network, in
line with previous work (Waites, Stanislavsky, Abbott, & Jackson. (2005)

functional connectivity. Human Brain Mapping, 24, 59-68.).

THE USE OF STEREOTYPICAL GENDER INFORMATION IS MODULATED BY
WORKING MEMORY AND ATTENTION DURING PRONOUN RESOLUTION
Lijing Qiu1, Suiping Wang1, Tamara Y. Swaab2, Hsuan-Chih Chen3; 1South
China Normal University, 2University of California at Davis, 3Chinese University
of Hong Kong — Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that ste-

reotypical gender information is used to resolve pronouns. But it is controversial how this information is used during real-time language
processing. For example, when pronouns violate the gender of antecedents, some ERP studies revealed an N400, others a P600, and in some
studies both were elicited. We suggest that working memory and attention may have contributed to these paradoxical findings. The present
study was therefore conducted to investigate whether or not working
memory (WM) and attention could affect stereotypical gender processing in Chinese sentences about persons. As in previous studies gender
congruency was manipulated. To assess potential effects of WM, we
manipulated the distance between pronouns and their antecedents. To
assess potential effects of attention, we manipulated the task of subjects
in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants read sentences in the
context of non-direct attention to pronoun processing. In Experiment 2,
participants read sentences in the context of direct attention to pronouns.
Results of Experiment 1 showed an N400-like effect for incongruent
compared to congruent pronouns in the short distance condition, while a
P600-like effect in the long distance condition was found. Results of
Experiment 2 demonstrated a P600 for both distance conditions. However, the effects differed with distance in topography; a centro-occipital
distribution was found in the short distance condition and a parietal distribution in the long distance condition. These results suggest that the
effects of gender stereotype on Chinese pronoun comprehension can be
modulated by working memory load and attention.

A SHIFT IN TIME: NEURAL PROCESSING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH
SHIFTS IN ASPECTUAL INTERPRETATION Martin Paczynski1, Tali DitmanBrunye2, Arim Choi3, Ray Jackendoff1, Gina Kuperberg1,2; 1Tufts University,
2Massachusetts General Hospital, 3Northwestern University — People readily

understand sentences such as “For several minutes the cat pounced…’ as
describing a cat performing multiple pounces, despite the fact that this
information is never explicitly specified. Such interpretation has been
proposed to rely on a type of enriched semantic composition known as
“aspectual coercion.” Previous research has indicated that aspectual
coercion carries an online processing cost (Piñango et al., 1999; Brennan
& Pylkkänen, 2008). Using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), we explored
several alternative mechanisms which could explain the source of these
costs. We create three sentences discourse scenarios, in which the critical
manipulation always appeared in the second sentence. For each scenario, we chose a contextually appropriate punctive (e.g. “pounce”) and
durative (e.g. “prowl”) verb which was preceded by one of three adverbial modifier phrases: punctive (e.g. “After several minutes”), durative
(e.g. “For several minutes”) or frequentative (e.g. “Several times”), thus
yielding a total of six conditions. Consistent with previous studies, we
found costs to punctive verbs preceded by durative adverbial phrases.
These evoked a widespread negativity between 400 and 700msec. Importantly, we observed a similar negativity for punctive verbs proceeded by
frequentative adverbial modifiers. Adverbial phrase type failed to modulate ERPs to durative verbs. Taken together, our results suggest that
previously observed costs of aspectual coercion may instead have been

232

driven by a need to shift interpretation from a punctive, instantaneous
event to an ongoing activity, rather than semantic coercion itself.

LAUGH AT A FUNERAL: DISTINCT ROLES OF VALENCE AND SEMANTIC
CONGRUITY IN DISCOURSE Gina R. Kuperberg1,2, Kana Okano1, Nathaniel

Delaney-Busch1; 1Tufts University, 2Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging,
Mass General Hospital — Though the neural mechanisms engaged in computing semantic congruity have been extensively studied, we know very
little about how emotional meaning is integrated into linguistic context.
The N400 event-related potential (ERP) is attenuated to words that are
semantically congruous (versus incongruous) with their preceding discourse context, reflecting a facilitation of lexico-semantic processing. We
asked whether an analogous N400 facilitation would be observed to
words that were valence congruous (versus incongruous) with their preceding context. ERPs were measured as 24 participants read two-sentence scenarios with critical words that varied by emotional valence
(pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant) and congruence (congruent or incongruent). In each scenario, the second sentence varied at a single critical
word (pleasant, unpleasant or neutral) that was either congruous or
incongruous with the preceding context (eg “Peggy smiled/gagged as
she walked into the basement. Something in that room was emanating a
wonderful/awful smell.”; eg neutral critical word: “Peggy sneezed …
was emanating a peppery/fruity smell”). Congruous critical words were
matched on cloze, and all incongruous critical words had zero cloze.
Though the neutral incongruous (vs. congruous) scenarios elicited a
large N400 effect, no N400 congruity effect was observed for either
pleasant or unpleasant incongruous (vs. congruous) critical words. The
incongruous emotional critical words elicited an attenuated N400,
despite their unpredictability.These findings suggest that valence congruity and semantic congruity are treated differently by the brain during
online discourse processing. Congruity of emotional salience appears to
facilitate lexico-semantic processing regardless of whether or not valence
was consistent across the scenario.

AN EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL INVESTIGATION OF REPAIRING CAUSAL
COHERENCE GAPS Tristan S. Davenport1, Seana Coulson1; 1UC San
Diego — Although causal inference generation and lexico-semantic association are both important factors in language processing, few studies
have directly compared their effects on word processing. Till, Mross &
Kintsch (1988) obtained behavioral evidence that separate lexical and
inferential relationships facilitate distinct phases of word processing. But
recent ERP work (Kuperberg, Paczynski & Ditman, 2010) shows that the
degree of a word's causal relatedness to its context affects the N400 - a
component linked to aspects of lexical activation - but no later ERP components. The present ERP study directly compares lexical and causal
inference facilitation of word processing. Sixteen subjects each heard 160
short vignettes containing causal coherence gaps, necessitating a causal
bridging inference. 400ms after the end of each vignette, one of four
visual probe words was presented: causally related to the coherence gap,
lexically related to the vignette's final word, or one of two unrelated conditions drawn from the lists of causal and lexical words to serve as controls. Causally and lexically related probes each elicited smaller N400s
than their unrelated controls. This effect was larger for the causal comparison than for the lexical. Causally related probes also elicited a late
positivity compared to their associated controls. The ERP data indicate
that constructing a causal bridging inference has a larger facilitatory
effect on subsequent word processing than lexico-semantic association.
Lexical and causal information facilitate word processing along similar
timecourses, although causally related words also elicited a late positivity, indicating extended processing of words related to repairing causal
coherence gaps.

SPANISH BLUES ACROSS TWO DIFFERENT SPANISH-SPEAKING

Psicología, Universidad de la República, Uruguay, 4VA Northern California,
Martinez, CA — Does a language’s way of categorizing colors affect the
way its speakers think about and mentally organize color, even in the
absence of an explicitly linguistic task? (e.g., Whorf, 1956, 1940) One special case – that of the color blue -- has been studied across several languages, including Japanese, Greek, Korean, and Russian. Unlike English,
these languages divide the color blue into two distinct linguistic categories. Interestingly, different populations of Spanish speakers differ in the
way they implement this distinction: in some South American countries,
the term ‘celeste’ is used on its own to depict light blue, while in Spain, it
is used only as a compound word which includes the supraordinate category of blue, i.e., ‘azul celeste’. In this study, we tested the blues question in the Spanish language, and also incorporated a cross-cultural
within-language comparison by testing two groups of native Spanishspeakers, one from Uruguay and one from Spain. Participants were
asked to decide which of two color squares matched a third square. Distracter squares were either from the same or different linguistic category.
As in Winawer et al.’s (2007) work comparing Russian and English
speakers, Uruguayan participants were more accurate when presented
with cross-category distracters. Contrary to prediction, Spanish participants also showed a cross-category facilitation effect. We discuss how
cultural as well as linguistic differences have been used to explain Whorfian effects across populations. This work contributes to our understanding of the interaction between language and thought.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN EFFECTS OF LEXICAL ASSOCIATION IN
AUDITORY SENTENCE CONTEXTS: AN ERP STUDY Megan A. Boudewyn1,

Debra L. Long1,2, Tamara Y. Swaab1; 1University of California, Davis, 2University
of Central Lancashire, England — We investigated individual differences in
effects of associative relations between words in sentences. Previous
studies of lexical associations in sentences have found mixed results
(Carroll & Slowiaczek, 1986; Morris, 1994; Traxler et al., 2000). However,
Van Petten et al. (1997) showed that such effects may vary with WM
span, with low span subjects relying more on word-level meaning relations. Individual differences in language processing have also been
attributed to other factors, including cognitive control and conceptual
memory (e.g., Long et al., 2006, Haarmann et al, 2003). We used ERPs,
digit, listening, and conceptual span tasks, the Stroop task, and a verbal
ability test to further explore individual variability in sensitivity to lexical associations during spoken sentence processing. Results show a
robust N400 effect of lexical association across all participants in the typical 300-500ms time window. However, the latency and topographical
distribution of this effect were variable and significantly correlated with
cognitive control and conceptual span. Specifically, good control participants showed a relatively late and more frontally distributed effect than
did poor control participants, who showed an earlier and more classically distributed centro-posterior effect. In contrast, high conceptual
span participants showed a very early and classically distributed N400
effect; this effect was later for low conceptual span participants. These
results suggest that there are multiple overlapping processes contributing to the N400 effect: the early centro-posterior effects seen here suggest
more automatic lexical processing, while more controlled integrative
processing may lead to the later, more frontal effects seen in high control
participants.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN MODULATES LANGUAGE-PERCEPTION
INTERACTIONS Jennifer Collins1, Seana Coulson1; 1UC San Diego — Consistent with grounded approaches to meaning (Barsalou, 2008) prior

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

research has shown that verbs of motion activate motion processing
areas MT+ (Saygin et al., 2010) and influence tasks of motion perception
(Meteyard et al., 2007). However, the possibility remains that effects
might reflect strategic factors engendered by blocked designs. Three
experiments tested whether motion verbs affect sensitivity to motion
using randomized (E1 and E2) and blocked (E3) presentation paradigms.
In all three experiments, participants were presented with random dot
kinematograms (RDKs) following Meteyard et al. (2007). They were
instructed to determine if motion was random or vertical. Vertical
motion was divided between upward and downward motion, randomized in E1 and E2, organized into blocks in E3. Concurrent verbs
described either upward, downward or horizontal motion, such as "rise",
"plummet" or "glide". Verbs were always randomized and were classified by congruency (congruent/incongruent/control) depending on
whether the motion of the verb and RDK were in the same or different
directions. Verbs were presented 300ms later in E1 than E2 and E3. The
influence of verb type on motion perception varied by trial arrangement.
In both E1 and E2 verbal stimuli affected neither perceptual sensitivity
(d’) nor decision criterion (C). In E3, when RDK direction was separated
by block, d’ was greater and C was lower for the congruent condition
than incongruent or control conditions. The facilitative influence of
motion verbs on perception found in previous studies might include a
strategic component because blocked perceptual organization, but not
blocked verb stimuli, influences performance.

N400 TO P600: DISCOURSE CONTEXT MODULATES THE “SEMANTIC
lanP600” Les Sikos1, Albert Kim1; 1University of Colorado — Several
guage-processing ERP studies report P600 effects for semantically-anomalous verb-argument combinations under various conditions (Hoeks et
al., 2004; Kim & Osterhout, 2005; Kolk et al., 2003; Kuperberg et al., 2003),
apparently deviating from earlier findings that semantic anomaly
enhances N400. Eliciting factors for these so-called “semantic P600”
effects are poorly understood and seemingly contradictory results have
been reported. For example, Kuperberg et al. (2003; 2007) found P600
effects for two-clause sentences (“Every morning at breakfast the eggs
would eat…”) while Kim & Sikos (submitted) reported LAN effects for
otherwise similar one-clause sentences (“The hearty meal would
devour…”). It is possible that contextual information carried in a preceding clause modulates the syntax-semantics interactions during these
anomalies. We propose that the appearance of particular content words
in discourse may generate a bias to treat future appearances of those
words as contextually appropriate, even if they are locally anomalous.
Such a bias may encourage structural (syntactic) reprocessing rather
than semantic reanalysis in response to the anomaly. This discourse-context hypothesis may also explain temporary “semantic illusion” effects
reported by Nieuwland & Van Berkum (2005) for animacy-violating
nouns, linking those findings with semantic P600s. We tested the discourse hypothesis using ERPs while participants read short stories that
varied in context and found that sentences with local semantic anomalies
elicited classic N400 effects when preceded by a “light” context but P600
effects when preceded by a “rich” context. This is the first direct evidence of semantic P600 effects being modulated by discourse context
within subjects.

FLEXIBLE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTICIPATORY LANGUAGE
COMPREHENSION MECHANISMS Edward Wlotko1, Kara Federmeier1;
1University of Illinois — Mechanisms

of language comprehension can be
flexibly implemented dependent upon situational context. In a series of
studies, event-related brain potentials have revealed anticipatory comprehension mechanisms that can be dampened when predications are
made unreliable (by including in the experiment plausible but unexpected sentence completions semantically related, often synonymous
with, the most expected completion). In order to determine the scope of
the effect of experimental context on comprehension modes, ending type
was blocked in the experimental design. When participants read synony-

233

Poster Session I — Tuesday, April 5, 3:00 - 5:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
mous endings in the first half of the experiment, no effect of predictability for unexpected items was observed in the second half, concordant
with results from the mixed design. Brain responses to the related endings themselves were drastically affected by the manipulation of experimental context. When read in the first half of the experiment, related
endings elicited a late left-lateralized frontal negativity previously
observed for expected endings, and linked to reinterpretation of contextual material when the context leads to multiple interpretations. When
presented in the second half of the experiment, related endings elicited
brain responses similar instead to the unrelated endings. These results
suggest that the success of a predictive mode of comprehension is evaluated on the fly vis-a-vis situational context and resources are allocated
accordingly in a particular communicative setting to most effectively
achieve comprehension goals.

WORD ASSOCIATIONS INVOLVE MODALITY-SPECIFIC CORTICES Amy

Price1, Michael Bonner1, Murray Grossman1; 1University of Pennsylvania —
OBJECTIVE: How are the processes that we use during the retrieval of
semantic associations related to our sensory perceptions of the world?
Our study aims to investigate whether semantic associations involve
perceptual-motor recruitment. We used an fMRI word matching experiment to examine the role of visual, motor and auditory features involved
in word associations. METHODS: During a BOLD fMRI study, young
healthy participants (n=6) viewed three words on a screen and
responded by button press to indicate which of the two word choices on
the bottom matched the word on top, in a paradigm similar to Pyramids
and Palm Trees. Word sets had strongly associated features (determined
by norming study) in one of three modalities: Motor (e.g., fork: chopsticks or drumstick; n=22), Visual (e.g., carrot: potato or lightbulb; n=22),
and Auditory (e.g., thunder: rocket or downpour; n=22). An Abstract
word condition (e.g., saga: epic or proxy; n=22) served as a baseline.
Conditions were matched for word length and frequency. Functional
localizers identified visual, motor and auditory regions within participants. RESULTS: Motor words activate regions associated with motor
planning and execution (including primary motor cortex). Visual words
recruit regions associated with visual perception in ventral temporal cortex. Auditory words do not reach a statistically significant level of activation in regions of auditory perception in these preliminary results.
CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that word meanings involve motor and visual feature knowledge in modality-specific
association cortices.

DO SENSORY AND MOTOR REGIONS OF CORTEX CONTRIBUTE TO WORD
MEANING? AN FMRI STUDY OF FEATURE REPRESENTATIONS IN WORD
MEANING Michael Bonner1, Murray Grossman1; 1University of
Pennsylvania — OBJECTIVE: fMRI studies demonstrate that perceptual
and motor regions of cortex are recruited when participants think about
the features of objects and actions. Few studies examine whether such
feature representations contribute to word meaning. We investigate the
role of auditory, visual and motor features in word recognition. METHODS: In BOLD fMRI, participants (n=20) viewed single words on a
screen and responded by button press to indicate if each word was real
or fake. Stimuli included words with strongly associated features (determined in a norming study) in three modalities: Auditory (e.g., thunder;
n=40), Visuomotor (e.g., handshake; n=40) and Visual (e.g., goldfish;
n=40). Conditions were matched for word length and lexical frequency.
Foils were pronounceable pseudowords (n=120). Functional localizers
identified visual, auditory and motor cortical regions. RESULTS: For all
three word conditions, we observed activity within or adjacent to the
corresponding perceptual or motor region: Auditory words recruited
superior temporal cortex (BA 22) associated with auditory perception;
Visuomotor words recruited frontal regions (BA 6) associated with
motor planning and execution and ventral temporal and occipital
regions (BA 37, 7) associated with visual perception and visuomotor
integration; and Visual words recruited ventral temporal regions (BA 37,

234

20) associated with visual perception. CONCLUSIONS: In a lexical decision task, sensory and motor association cortices are selectively
recruited, consistent with the hypothesis that word meanings rely in part
on feature representations in sensory and motor cortical regions.

IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING: NARRATION IN FRONTOTEMPORAL
DEMENTIA Tilbe Goksun1, Sharon Ash1, Murray Grossman1, Anjan

Chatterjee1; 1University of Pennsylvania — How do patients with frontotem-

poral dementia (FTD) describe motion when narrating a story? We analyzed the linguistic production of motion event components, the path
(where a figure moves) and manner (how a figure moves) of motion in
discourse in FTD patients. In the sentence “The boy runs into a room,”
RUNNING describes the manner and INTO THE ROOM describes the
path of the motion. Previous research suggests that the manner involves
posterolateral temporal lobes, whereas the path involves superior parietal and frontal eye fields (Wu et al., 2008). We predict that degenerative
conditions affecting different parts of the brain would affect different
aspects of event descriptions. Patients with semantic dementia (SD, n=9),
nonaphasic patients with a behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD, n= 14),
patients with progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA, n= 16), and elderly
controls (n= 19) narrated a story from a wordless picture book. As
expected, PNFA patients produced fewer words and utterances than
controls (p<.05). Although patients with SD produced fewer nouns compared to other groups (p<.05), no difference was found for verb production. PNFA and SD groups produced fewer manner verbs than bvFTD
and controls, but they produced more path verbs without manner like
EXIT, ESCAPE. Patients with SD replaced manner verbs with simple
path verbs like GO, COME. These findings suggest that degenerative
conditions lead to qualitative differences in describing motion events.
Due to neuronal pathology in the left temporal lobe, patients with SD
and PNFA would have difficulties retrieving verbs that precisely
describe manners of motion.

FMRI EVIDENCE FOR A PHONOLOGICAL EXCITATION ACCOUNT OF
ASSOCIATIVE FACILITATION IN PICTURE NAMING Greig de Zubicaray1,

Kori Johnson2, Niels Schiller3, Katie McMahon2; 1School of Psychology,
University of Queensland, 2Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of
Queensland, 3Leiden Institute of Brain and Cognition — Recent accounts of
associative facilitation in the picture word interference (PWI) paradigm
have attributed the effect to semantic priming (e.g., Abdel Rahman &
Mellinger, 2009; Costa et al., 2005). However, an earlier phonological
account attributed the effect to activation spreading between excitatory
links at the word form level, due to the co-occurrence of associates in
language use (Cutting & Ferreira, 1999). In an fMRI study, we contrasted
hypotheses from these rival accounts by presenting written distractors
that were either associatively related (e.g., hive) or unrelated (e.g., moth)
to the target object (e.g., BEE) 150 ms prior to picture presentation. We
also examined the effect of categorically related distractors (e.g., fish) in
an attempt to determine whether interference and facilitation effects,
although of opposite polarity, are attributable to the same processing
level. An additional naming only condition was employed to isolate distractor effects. Overall, pairing distractor words with target pictures during naming elicited fMRI activity in a predominantly left hemisphere
cortical network when compared to naming alone. Associates resulted in
significantly faster naming latencies than unrelated distractor-target
pairs and elicited a significant increase in activity solely in the left posterior temporal cortex. However, categorically related distractors produced only marginally slower naming latencies compared to unrelated
words and no significant differences in activity. We interpret the results
as supporting a phonological excitation account of associative facilitation, and discuss the implications for some recently proposed models of
lexical selection in speech production.

FMRI CORRELATES OF WORD-FINDING DEFICITS IN GULF WAR

Hart1, Mike Kraut2, Robert Haley3; 1University of Texas at Dallas, 2Johns
Hopkins University, 3University of Texas at Southwestern Medical Center — The

Gulf War Syndrome, observed in veterans deployed during operation
Desert Storm, has been characterized as having three distinct sub-divisions: Haley Syndrome 1 (HS1); Haley Syndrome 2 (HS2); and Haley
Syndrome 3 (HS3). Haley Syndrome 2 and to a lesser degree HS1 have
reported difficulties in cognitive domains, including memory and word
finding difficulties. We employed a task of semantic object retrieval
(SORT) during fMRI to determine if there were any correlates to these
reported impairments. Previously, this task in normal controls has been
shown to engage medial BA6, caudate, and thalamus. A total of 97 subjects where tested; 30 subjects comprising a group of controls while the
remaining 67 subjects were divided into the respective HS syndromes.
Subjects performed that SORT task in the scanner where they were presented two words that were features of objects (e.g., ‘desert’ ‘humps’) to
see if they combined to activate a specific object memory. Region of
interest results showed significant differences between groups for percent signal change (PSC) were found in BA6 for HS2 (p < .01). HS2 also
showed a trend towards decreased levels of % correct responses when
compared to controls at 75% correct (p=.06) correct. These findings show
that HS2 patients have a clear behavioral performance decrement in a
task of semantic memory retrieval that appears to be associated with
decrease signal changes in medial BA6, a region shown to be engaged in
both semantic memory retrieval and verbal production.

LIFG RESOLVES COMPETITION BETWEEN REPRESENTATIONS OF AN
OBJECT BEFORE AND AFTER AN EVENT Gerry T.M. Altmann1, Nicholas C.

Hindy2, Emily Kalenik2, Sharon L. Thompson-Schill2; 1University of York, UK.,
2
University of Pennsylvania — When an object is described as changing state

during the course of an event, the representations of those states (the
‘before’ and ‘after’) compete; the distinct states they represent cannot coexist at any one moment yet each such representation must be retrievable (at the cost of suppressing the other). On reading “the squirrel will
crack the acorn”, we must keep track of multiple representational instantiations of the acorn –before it was cracked, and after– and retrieve just
the right one if the acorn is subsequently referred to. Conversely, reading
“the squirrel will sniff the acorn” requires only a single (unchanged)
instantiation of the acorn. We used fMRI to test the hypothesis that such
competition recruits the same brain regions that are involved in other
forms of conflict resolution. Parts of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG)
have previously been demonstrated to be central in resolving competition amongst incompatible representations of a single stimulus (e.g., an
ambiguous word or a garden-path sentence). We found that increased
activation in posterior LIFG (BA44) during sentence reading correlated
with the rated degree to which the mentioned object changed in state;
this change-related activation co-localized with conflict-dependent activation during color naming in a Stroop task. In contrast, activation in
mid LIFG (BA45), which co-localized with increased activation during a
distinct sentence comprehension task, negatively correlated with the
rated imageability of the described action, but did not correlate with
rated change. These results suggest that, when representing change,
multiple representational instantiations of an object do compete.

DO SENTENCE PRODUCTION AND COMPREHENSION SHARE COGNITIVE
CONTROL MECHANISMS? Gina Humphreys1, Silvia Gennari1; 1Psychology
Department - University of York, UK — Previous research suggests that language production and comprehension share a common knowledge base,
e.g., lexical and grammatical rules but that they engage different processes, e.g., word retrieval vs. word recognition. Yet, the extent to which
producing and comprehending recruit common mechanisms is not well
understood. Here, we hypothesized that sentence production and com-

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

prehension, and specifically, determining who is doing what to whom in
the sentence, recruit similar semantic control mechanisms, particularly
when alternative semantic roles (agent vs. patient) compete. To this end,
we compared sentences that differ in the degree of semantic roles’ competition both in production and comprehension. Using event-related
fMRI, three tasks were completed: sentence comprehension, sentence
completion, and a colour Stroop task, which was used to identify regions
sensitive to conflict/competition in semantic representations. In the
comprehension task, visually presented sentences were occasionally followed by comprehension questions (catch trials). In the sentence completion task, participants were given the first phrase of the sentence to
covertly complete. The reading portion of this task was distinguished
from the production/completion portion. The results showed that
within a region of the left inferior frontal gyrus that was activated by the
Stroop task, activity was modulated by the degree of semantic competition in a similar manner for both the comprehension and the production
tasks. This suggests that semantic competition processes modulate brain
responses common to both tasks, and are therefore shared by production
and comprehension. More generally, the results suggest that language
processing shares mechanisms and resources with other cognitive tasks.

THE NEURAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION
NETWORK: CONVERGING EVIDENCE FROM LESION AND CONNECTIVITY
ANALYSES And Turken1, Nina Dronkers1,2; 1VA Northern California Health

Care System, 2UC Davis Neurology Department — In an earlier investigation,
we assessed the brain areas necessary for auditory sentence comprehension using a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis with 64
aphasic patients (Dronkers et al., 2004). In the present study, we
extended these findings by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) datasets
from healthy subjects to assess the connectional anatomy of these previously-identified regions. Tractography and functional connectivity analysis results indicated that the left posterior middle temporal gyrus
(MTG) and underlying white matter, the anterior superior temporal
gyrus and BA22, inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis (BA47), the anterior
middle frontal gyrus (BA46), the posterior superior temporal sulcus
(STS) and BA39, and white matter underlying the STS are part of a richly
interconnected network that extends to additional frontal, parietal and
temporal regions in the two hemispheres. The major white matter pathways implicated in this network were the inferior occipito-frontal fasciculus (IOFF), the arcuate fasciculus (AF), the middle and inferior
longitudinal fasciculi (MdLF, ILF), the uncinate fasciculus (UF), and
transcallosal projections via the tapetum. The posterior MTG showed a
particularly extensive functional connectivity pattern and was associated
with five major pathways. These observations might explain the severe
language comprehension impairments produced by lesions affecting the
MTG, and are consistent with the notion that this region plays a role in
core lexical-semantic processes. Further analyses also revealed subregions with distinct structural and functional connectivity patterns and
showing a differentiation along the rostro-caudal axis, suggesting functional heterogeneity within the MTG.

THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF MEANING Gina

Grimshaw1,
Jessica
Stewart1, Jan Lauwereyns2; 1Victoria University of Wellington, 2Kyushu
University — Although we often dichotomise information as meaningful
or meaningless, meaning exists in the mind of the perceiver; it is not an
inherent property of the stimulus. Thus the threshold between meaningful and meaningless may be dynamic, shifting with contextual variables.
We present a series of behavioural studies in which participants made
meaningfulness judgments of random adjective-noun word pairs (e.g.,
brave slipper), presented in different experimental contexts. When the
experiment included a number of clearly related word pairs (either literal pairs such as tall building, or conventional metaphors such as lost
soul), participants judged very few of the random word pairs as meaningful. However, when only random word pairs were presented, rates of

235

Poster Session I — Tuesday, April 5, 3:00 - 5:00 pm, Pacific Concourse
meaningfulness judgments increased dramatically. Across participants,
similar word pairs were rated as meaningful, suggesting that participants were not simply responding randomly to meet some criterion level
of response. Instead, findings suggest that in the absence of a clear standard for meaning, participants either increased their conceptual effort to
help them find meaning, lowered their criterion for reporting meaningfulness, or both. A follow-up ERP study tested both of these hypotheses,
using the N400 to index conceptual effort and the lateralized readiness
potential (LRP) to index response preparation. Although the N400 did
not show clear evidence of a shift in conceptual processing across conditions, the LRP clearly demonstrated an increased preparedness for
meaningful responses when random word pairs were presented in isolation. Findings are consistent with a shifting criterion for meaningfulness.

CAUSAL INFERENCE PROCESSING Connie Shears1, Matthew Baker1,

Jessica Green1; 1Chapman University — The left hemisphere is dominant for
processing language (Beeman & Chiarello, 1998) but when emotions
come into play inthere appears to be hemispheric differences. Previous
research suggests a right-hemisphere advantage in processing both
causal inferences and emotional language. Borod (1992) found that there
is right hemisphere dominance regardless of emotional valence. Other
researchers have argued against this theory, finding that the left hemisphere processes language faster than the right hemisphere (Miller, n.d.)
and that negative emotion is often processed in the right hemisphere,
while positive emotion does not elicit hemispheric asymmetries (Smith
& Bulman-Fleming, 2006). In the current study, we sought to investigate
how causal inferences were processed differentially between hemispheres across emotional valences. Sixty-four participants completed a
computer-based word recognition task that involved identification of the
presence of target words in sentence pairs. Target words were drawn
either from the sentence text or from inferential information and were
presented to either the left or right visual field. Sentence pairs were classified as either inference-supporting or non-inference-supporting, and as
having either a positive, neutral, or negative emotional valence. Results
suggested a left-hemisphere bias for processing negative inferences, and
a right-hemisphere bias for processing neutral inferences. This conflicts
with theories that attribute emotional language processing to only the
right hemisphere, and supports the important role of the right hemisphere in the formation of causal inferences for non-emotional language.

EVIDENCE OF CONTEXT-SENSITIVE SEMANTIC PROCESSING IN THE
BRAIN Colleen Crangle1,2, Marcos Perreau-Guimaraes1, Patrick Suppes1;
1Stanford University, 2Converspeech LLC, California — The

goal of this work
is to detect evidence of semantic processing in brain waves using the
high temporal resolution of EEG. The semantic framework is given by
WordNet, a lexical database of English organized around sets of cognitive synonyms, and a probability-based method that extracts word relations from text on the web. The EEG data derive from experiments in
which statements about commonly known geographic facts of Europe
were presented to participants who were asked to determine their truth
or falsity. Using ten geography words, T=640 brain data samples timelocked to the presentation of the words and extracted from the EEG
recordings are classified into the N=10 classes associated with the words
'London', 'Moscow', 'Paris', 'north', 'south', 'east', 'west', 'Germany',
'Poland', and 'Russia'. Ordinal relations of similarity differences are
derived for the brain and semantic data, with one set of semantic data
restricted to be contextually relevant and the other not. Spearman rank
correlations are computed across the ordinal relations of similarity differences, comparing the brain and semantic data to find those relations
that are invariant with respect to both (rho?0.8; p<0.0014). The results
from 120 classifications of the brain data are compared with the contextrelevant and semantically-unrestricted data. The results show that statistically significant structural similarities can be found between the brain
and semantic data restricted to be contextually relevant. But without
contextual restrictions, the brain and semantic data fail to exhibit statisti-

236

cally significant structural similarities. These results provide new evidence of context-sensitive semantic processing in the brain.

NOUN OBJECT DISCRIMINATION IN LEFT INFERIOR TEMPORAL
CORTEX Melissa M Rundle1, Andrew C Connolly1, Richard H Granger1;
1Dartmouth College — Previous

work demonstrated that pictures of
objects elicited object-specific voxel patterns in inferior temporal cortex.
We wanted to determine whether words alone would also give rise to
selective pattern responses. Participants (5M, 10F; right-handed; mean
age: 23±3) were given a recall task for nouns while undergoing fMRI. 360
trials each consisted of three serially presented single words (560msec
each), selected from one of six categories: birds, mammals, fruits, vegetables, musical instruments, and hand tools. Subjects were periodically
asked to recall having seen a given set of words; accuracy was 91% ± 4%.
Multivariate pattern analysis within a searchlight identified voxel clusters that accurately distinguished among object words for the six categories. A group analysis of the searchlight results revealed a region of high
sensitivity for noun object categories in left temporal cortex (x,y,z: -48,45,-18; p<.005). We examined the dissimilarity structure -- one minus
correlation distance between activation patterns for different categories.
Multidimensional scaling analysis showed three groups of two elements
each: i) birds and mammals; ii) fruits and vegetables; iii) musical instruments and hand tools. Inter-subject correlation for dissimilarity matrices
in this region was modest (mean = .21) but significantly higher than
chance. Although there was more inter-subject variability within the ROI
than found in prior findings for object pictures, the present results indicate that a left temporal neural population is capable of semantic noun
category discrimination.

specialized). In a lexical decision task the same target word was preceded by an idiom or by an unrelated A-N (ISI 115 ms). For an opaque AN the target "unimportant" was preceded by the idiomatic "ivory tower"
or an unrelated A-N "full plate". For the specialized items the target "politics" was preceded by the specialized idiom "iron curtain" or the unrelated A-N: "light blouse". Reaction time (RT) priming occurred both for
specialized and opaque items and for related control conditions. In contrast, for N400 priming occurred for specialized items (and the related
control condition), but not for the opaque items. An effect of transparency thus was found for N400 but not for RT. In Experiment 2 we used
the same procedure and materials but inflected the idiomatic A-N, creating an unexpected form of the A-N. Inflection led to a disappearance of
the RT effect to opaque, specialized, and even related items. In contrast,
for N400 again a priming effect was found for specialized items and
related items, but not for the opaque items. Flexibility in idiom processing and dissociation between N400 and RT results present a challenge
for current models of idiom processing. The dissociation may be
explained by the low form frequency of the inflected idioms which could
induce too much noise in pattern recognition (no RT effect) while the
processing of the meaning is preserved (N400 effect).

VISUAL SEMANTIC PRIMING STRENGTHENS THE AUDITORY TEMPLATE
OF A LEXICAL TONE: AN MMN STUDY Suksun Itthipanyanan1, Ulrike

Zimmer1, Marty Woldorff1; 1Center of Cognitive Neuroscience, Duke
University — In tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese, the tonal characteristics of speech sounds impart different semantic meanings to those
sounds (e.g., /hu/ with a rising tone means ‘teapot’ but /hu/ with a
dipping tone means ‘tiger’). The close association between tones and
meanings in tonal languages has been evidenced in pure auditory para-

digms at both early sensory and later semantic levels (e.g. BrownSchmidt, 2004; Chandrasekaran et al., 2007). So far, however, whether
and how tone/meaning integration might occur across visual and auditory modalities has not been examined. To address how visual semantic
priming might influence lexical tone perception, the present eventrelated potential (ERP) study employed a visual-priming auditory-oddball paradigm, in which a TEAPOT or a TIGER picture preceded an
auditory speech stimulus by 300 ms. The auditory stream consisted of
Chinese word sounds that could be either “teapot” or “tiger” (standard,
70%) or an artificial sound (deviant, 15%) whose tone structure fell in
between those of ‘teapot’ and ‘tiger’ sounds. On the deviant-sound trials
where the priming visual stimulus had the same meaning (congruent)
versus different meaning (incongruent) as the repeated standard sound,
the extracted auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) was significantly
larger from 130-450 ms. This finding demonstrates that the crossmodal
influence of visual semantic priming input on lexical tone perception can
occur very early in processing. Moreover, this MMN increase suggests
that the congruent visual priming strengthened the template of the
repeated standard sounds, leading to a cross-modally induced amplification of the detection of deviancy in lexical tone structure.

WHEN DO YOU GRASP THE IDEA? MEG EVIDENCE FOR INSTANTANEOUS

Friedemann Pulvermüller2; 1Laboratoire Dynamique du Langage, CNRS, Lyon,
France, 2MRC Cognitive and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK — We inves-

tigated the time-course of cortical activation during comprehension of
concrete and figurative language using MEG and anatomically guided
distributed source analysis. Previous fMRI work showed that the comprehension of sentences including action-related words elicits somatotopic semantic activation along the motor strip, reflecting meaning
aspects of the constituent words. Furthermore, idioms more strongly
activated temporal pole and prefrontal cortex than literal sentences. We
here show that idiom reading modulated anterior frontotemporal activation very early, already 150 ms after sentence critical disambiguating
words (“kick the habit”). In parallel, the meaning of action words
embedded in sentences was reflected by activation of precentral motor
systems. As neural reflections of constituent parts of abstract sentences
were manifest at the same early latencies as more general indexes of
abstract vs. concrete meaning processing, we conclude that within ¼ of a
second, compositional and abstract context-driven processes in parallel
contribute to abstract sentence meaning computation.

LANGUAGE IN ACTION OR ACTION IN LANGUAGE? AN EEG+MEG STUDY
ON INTERACTION BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND THE MOTOR SYSTEM

Giovanna Mollo1, Friedemann Pulvermüller2, Olaf Hauk2; 1Institute for
Advanced Biomedical Technologies G D'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy,
2
Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge,
UK. — Several studies has shown activation in motor cortex during the
processing of action-related words or sentences. However, brain activation measures are correlational, and thus motor cortex activation does
not automatically imply that motor cortex is crucial for these processes.
Our study therefore addressed the question whether activation in motor
cortex affects activation in non-motor language areas. In the experiment,
participants started trials by pressing a button either with their index finger or foot (effector type, Fg or Ft). They kept the button pressed until a
letter string appeared on the screen. If the letter string was a word, they
had to release the button as quickly as possible, or otherwise wait until
the end of the trial (lexical decision, LD). In another task, participants
had to respond quickly to concrete words, and delay for abstract ones
(semantic decision, SD). The (concrete) words were subdivided into armrelated and leg-related action-words. We hypothesized that if motor cortex is part of cell assemblies representing the words’ semantics, the congruency between effector type for the button press should interact with
word category in motor as well as non-motor brain areas. We measured

Cognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

306-channel MEG and 70-channel EEG and applied ROI analysis on
MNE source estimates to test this prediction. A congruency motor effect
is present for motor areas [p<.05] and Superior Temporal Gyrus (classical language region) [p<.05] within the first 150 msec from the word presentation This is a crucial evidence that the motor system is part of the
semantic brain networks for action-words.

COMPREHENSION AND REPETITION OF SENTENCES NEED BOTH DORSAL
AND VENTRAL FIBER TRACTS Sarah M. E. Gierhan1,2, Alfred Anwander1,

Angela D. Friederici1; 1MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig,
Germany, 2Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt University of Berlin,
Germany — During language processing white matter fiber bundles are

used for information propagation between the temporal and frontal
lobes. Potential candidates for fiber tracts dorsally connecting the two
lobes are the arcuate fascicle (AF) and the superior longitudinal fascicle
(SLF). Candidates for a ventral connection are the external capsule (ExC),
the extreme capsule (EmC) and the uncinate fascicle (UF). Still controversial, however, is which specific linguistic information is processed via
which specific fiber tract (e.g., Saur et al. 2008, Friederici 2009). Our
study aimed to elucidate the fiber tracts involved in a) comprehension
and b) repetition of meaningful and meaningless spoken German sentences. Therefore, we conducted within-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on healthy
volunteers. The results show that for both repetition and comprehension,
brain regions are needed that are connected by dorsal and ventral fiber
tracts. Dorsally, the information is propagated via the AF/SLF, terminating in postero-medial temporal regions and parietal regions. Ventrally,
there is a differentiation between comprehension and repetition: comprehension of meaningful sentence information appears to be propagated via the ExC/EmC and the UF, whereas sentences consisting of
meaningless words are repeated only via the ExC/EmC. We conclude: 1)
Not only regions connected via ventral fiber tracts, but also regions connected via dorsal fiber tracts are needed for comprehending lexical and
combinatorial meaning of sentences. 2) Mapping a newly heard word
form onto an unfamiliar articulation not only needs regions connected
via dorsal fiber tracts, but also regions connected via ventral fiber tracts.

ACTIVATION AND INHIBITION OF CONTEXTS WHILE READING; AN ERP
STUDY Heather MacLaren1, J. Bruno Debruille1,2; 1McGill University,

2Douglas Institute Research Center — In order to follow a story or novel, it
seems that content words have to activate the context in which they previously occurred. However, if a word appears in a new context this activation may be inappropriate. The present study aimed to test whether
the N400 event-related potential (ERP) indexes the inhibition of these
inappropriate contexts or the activation of semantic representations corresponding to the word. ERPs were recorded during sentence reading.
There were 28 series of 3 blocks. Block 1 included seven sentences. Block
2 included seven new sentence contexts using the same final words as
the block 1 sentences. In block 3, the seven final words occurred in isolation and participants were asked to recall the two contexts. ERPs elicited
by the block 2 sentence endings were examined. Those obtained when
the block 1 context was remembered at block 3 were compared to those
obtained when the block 1 was not remembered. Consistent with the
inhibition hypothesis, the early part of the N400s were larger when the
first context was forgotten. Unexpectedly, the P600s were larger when
both contexts were remembered. These results suggest that 2 related
stages of processing occur after the preconscious activation of previous
contexts. First, some of these contexts could be inhibited, which would
be indexed by larger N400s. Second, the number (and importance) of
remaining contexts being placed in working memory would be positively correlated with P600 amplitudes.

N400 AS AN INDEX OF INHIBITION: A STUDY WITH HIGHLY REPEATED
STIMULI Miles Shang1, J. Bruno Debruille1; 1McGill University — The N400
is an event-related potential (ERP) that indexes semantic processing. It is
modulated by semantic priming and repetition, amongst other factors. A
recent study using a three-word paradigm has suggested that the N400
represents a semantic inhibition rather than an activation. However,
questions were raised as to whether the results of this study could be
related to the contingent negative variation (CNV) or the P600 ERPs
rather than to the N400. To address this issue, we capitalized on studies
showing that the N400 is discernable even with massive repetition.
Indeed, these studies produced N400s that were easier to discern from
CNVs and P600s. Here, we thus used this repetition technique, along
with the three-word paradigm, to further test the inhibition hypothesis.
In one block, participants judged whether the second word was semantically related to the third word. In another block, they did the same
regarding the first and third words, thus ignoring the second. The classic
semantic match N400 effect was found for the third words (but not for
the second), further confirming previous studies showing that genuine
N400 effects can be found with massive repetition. As predicted by the
inhibition hypothesis, the amplitudes of the N400 elicited by the second
words were greater when participants had to ignore them than when
they had to use them. Most surprisingly, N100s were also found to be
larger for the actively ignored words. Our conclusion pertains to the
mechanisms by which we ignore the meaning of words that have our
focus.

MEMORY DEFICITS FOR ARM- AND LEG-RELATED WORDS INDUCED BY
DRUMMING EXERCISES Friedemann Pulvermuller1, Zubaida Shebani1;
1MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge — Language

and action
systems of the human brain are functionally interwoven. Speaking about
actions and understanding action-related speech sparks the motor system of the human brain and, conversely, motor system activation has an
influence on the comprehension of action words and sentences.
Although previous research has shown that motor systems become
active when we understand language, a major question still remains
whether these motor system activations are necessary for processing
action words. We here report that complex rhythmic drumming exercises, so-called paradiddles, performed using either the hands or the feet,
lead to a differential impairment of working memory for concordant
arm- and leg-related action words. Moving the arms more strongly
impairs working memory for words typically used to speak about arm
actions, whereas leg movements impair leg word memory more
severely. In documenting a motor locus of working memory for specific
action-related word categories, these results demonstrate that processing
resources in specific parts of the cortical motor system are critical for
action word processing, more specifically for keeping action words in
working memory.

FROM WORDS TO EMOTION VIA BODY MOTION: A ROLE FOR THE MOTOR
SYSTEM IN BINDING ABSTRACT MEANING Rachel Moseley1, Francesca

Carota1, Olaf Hauk1, Bettina Mohr1,2, Friedemann Pulvermüller1; 1MRC
Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK, 2Anglia Ruskin University,
Cambridge, UK — Contemporary theories of semantics suggest that word

meaning is embodied in the brain in the connections between word form
circuits in language areas and perceptual object representations in the
ventral stream. This view, however, fails to explain representation of
abstract concepts, including emotion words such as 'hope' or 'loathing'.
Whilst their meaning relates to emotional brain systems in the limbic
system, it is unclear how the link between an internal body state and a
word form can be learnt. In one view, motor activities expressing emotion (e.g. scowling) are crucial for learning correspondences between
emotional body states and word forms. This hypothesis predicts that
emotion words activate brain systems for emotion-expressing body

238

parts: the face and arm motor and premotor cortex in the dorsal stream.
To test this hypothesis, we compared the brain activation evoked by
emotion words to that brought about by face- and arm-related action
words in a tachistoscopic silent reading task during fMRI scanning.
Semantic networks for emotion words were found to include classical
limbic areas such as the cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, insula and basal
ganglia, and to overlap strongly with arm- and face-related words in
activating effector-specific areas in motor and premotor cortex. These
results were confirmed for highly abstract emotion words with low
imageability and without overt action connotations. We conclude that,
similar to their role in action verb processing, activation of frontocentral
motor systems reflects the semantic binding of sign and meaning of
abstract words denoting internal emotional states.

HEMISPHERIC INFERENCE PRIMING DURING COMPREHENSION OF
CONVERSATION Chivon Powers1, Mark Beeman1; 1Northwestern
University — Understanding conversational language emphasizes different processes than understanding narrative, and may result in a distinct
pattern of lateralized processing during comprehension. This study
investigates lateralization of comprehension processes while people listen to conversations that promote causal inferences at coherence inference points, when inferential information must be incorporated in order
to maintain coherence about the conversation. Some evidence for inference generation during comprehension comes from studies showing
priming for inferences, that is, faster recognition for inference-related
than –unrelated words when inferences are generated during comprehension. Our objective was to examine hemispheric contributions to
priming for inferences embedded in conversation. We tested 21 undergraduates listening to 36 conversations promoting 100 total inferences.
Target words were presented to the left visual field-right hemisphere
(lvf-RH) or to the right visual field-left hemisphere (rvf-LH) at coherence
inference points. Targets were piloted to ensure their strong relatedness
to the promoted inferences, but no strong semantic relation to any individual words in the dialogue up to the inference points. Participants
showed stronger inference priming for lvf-RH target words than for rvfLH target word, which suggests drawing inferences from conversation
heavily relies on RH integration processes. Ultimately, we demonstrate
that inferences can be promoted within conversation and highlight a
potentially important lateralization distinction for comprehension of
conversational language.

BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS AND LESION SITES ASSOCIATED WITH
IMPAIRED PROCESSING OF LEXICAL AND CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF
ACTIONS David Kemmerer1,2, David Rudrauf1, Ken Manzel1, Daniel Tranel1;

University of Iowa, 2Purdue University — We administered to 226 braindamaged patients a battery of 6 tasks that probe lexical and conceptual
knowledge of actions in a variety of verbal and non-verbal ways, including naming, word-picture matching, attribute judgments involving both
words and pictures, and associative comparisons involving both words
and pictures. 61 patients failed one or more of the tasks, with 4 patients
being impaired on the entire battery, and varied numbers of patients
being impaired on varied combinations of tasks. The lesion sites of 147
patients were also investigated, using formal methods for lesion-deficit
statistical mapping and power analysis of lesion overlap maps. Significant effects for all 6 tasks were found in the following left-hemisphere
regions: the inferior frontal gyrus; the ventral precentral gyrus, extending superiorly into what are likely to be hand-related primary motor and
premotor areas; and the anterior insula. In addition, significant effects
for 4-5 tasks were found in not only the regions just mentioned, but also
in several other left-hemisphere areas: the ventral postcentral gyrus; the
supramarginal gyrus; and the posterior middle temporal gyrus. These
results converge with previous research on the neural underpinnings of
action words and concepts. However, the current study goes considerably beyond most previous investigations by providing extensive behavioral and lesion data for an unusually large and diverse sample of brainCognitive Neuroscience Society — 2011 Annual Meeting

support for the Embodied Cognition Framework, which maintains that
conceptual knowledge is grounded in sensorimotor systems.

WITH AUTISM Yan Yu1, Michelle MacRoy-Higgins2, Sarita Austin1, April

tal advance in our understanding of human language would come from
a detailed account of how non-linguistic and linguistic manual actions
are differentiated in real time by language users. We targeted the N400, a
well-established component known to be sensitive to lexical-semantic
integration, to investigate deaf signers’ brain response when processing
signed sentences incorporating target items of varying linguistic status.
Forty deaf signers took part. Each saw a sequence of 120 sign sentences,
consisting of a “frame” (a sentence without the last word; e.g. BOY
SLEEP IN HIS) followed by a “last item” belonging to one of four categories: a high-cloze-probability sign (a “semantically reasonable” completion to the sentence; e.g. BED), a low-cloze-probability sign (a real sign
that is nonetheless a “semantically odd” completion to the sentence; e.g.
LEMON), a non-sign (phonologically legal but non-occurring form, created here by articulating an existing sign with a different handshape), or
a non-linguistic grooming gesture (e.g. the performer scratching behind
her ear). Significant N400-like responses occurred in the “semantically
odd” and non-sign contexts, with stronger such responses in the nonsign condition. In contrast, the non-linguistic gesture context was associated with a consistently positive response rather than an N400. These
findings suggest that deaf signers can quickly detect and reject non-linguistic manual actions during real-time language processing. Moreover,
our findings represent an important step in understanding the relationship between the processing of language and that of human actions in
general, and offer information about the time-course and neural topography of these effects.

Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey — Very
few studies have investigated the language processing skills in nonverbal (NV) children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) due to the
reliance of overt behavioral responses in traditional behavioral methods.
The purpose of this study was to use electrophysiology to assess semantic processing in NV children with ASD. We recorded event-related
potentials (ERPs) to auditory words paired with a preceding picture that
matched the word (“duck” and picture of a duck) or was unrelated to the
picture (“duck” with picture of a bowl) from 3 years of age to adults in a
passive task. Adults showed an expected superior-posterior increase in
negativity (N400) to the unrelated picture-word pairs around 300 ms following word onset. Typically developing children showed a significant
increased negativity to the unrelated word beginning 420 ms following
word onset at sites near the vertex (CZ) rather than at more posterior
sites. Two of the NV ASD children showed similar patterns to the TD
groups. The remaining four ASD children showed attenuated responses
or reversed superior-inferior polarity to the words and no evidence of
increased vertex negativity to the mismatched words. These peliminary
data suggest that this passive design can be used to inform our understanding of language processing in non-verbal children with ASD.

N200 AND N400 MODULATIONS ELICITED BY PHONOLOGICAL AND
SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE Eva
Gutierrez1, Deborah Williams1, Mike Grosvald1, Sarah Hafer1, David Corina1;
1Center for Mind and Brain. University of California, Davis — Goal: The notion

that language forms (phonology) are arbitrarily related to meaning
(semantics) is often considered a central tenet of the properties of human
languages. Spoken languages overwhelmingly exhibit a clear separation
between properties of language form and language meaning. In signed
languages this separation of form and meaning may not apply to the
same degree. Methods: EEG was recorded while 17 native signers of
American Sign Language (ASL) watched ASL sentences for comprehension in which semantic(S) expectancy and phonological(P) form was systematically manipulated. Analysis of ERP components revealed a
modulation of the N200 and N400 to semantically and phonologically
related signs. Results: As expected, and consistent with previous
research, a classic N400 effect was observed in the UNRELATED(-S-P)
condition. Unexpectedly, N200 components were modulated in cases of
shared (congruent) semantics and/or shared phonological information.
This may indicate that both semantic and phonological features of the
expected sign are activated and cause competition effects during the lexical selection process. In addition, latency differences of the onset of the
N400 were observed; N400 elicited by both, the semantically (+S-P) and
the phonologically (-S+P) related conditions, had an earlier onset than
the elicited by the UNRELATED(-S-P). Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that access to semantic and phonological properties are
present early during ASL lexical access, and incur similar on-line processing costs. These data provide evidence for an intimate relationship
between form and meaning during natural language processing of ASL
signs.

REMEMBERING WALK, JUMP, KICK, AND STROLL: BRAIN-INDICES OF
WORKING MEMORY FOR ACTION-RELATED WORDS Zubaida Shebani1,
Francesca Carota1, Olaf Hauk1, James Rowe1, Friedemann Pulvermüller1;
1Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit — The recogni-

tion of action-related words activates specific motor areas of the human
brain and this activation has been interpreted as a correlate of the meaning of these words. An alternative suggestion is that such motor system
activation is epiphenomenal reflecting a process following semantic processing, but not intrinsically related to it. We therefore used fMRI to
study performance in a task where subjects had to fully engage in action
word processing in order to be successful. In a high-load memory condition, they had to keep in working memory four closely related action
words. In a low-load control task that still allowed for some epiphenomenal mental activity, only one such item had to be memorized. Results
replicated activation in areas known to be linked to verbal working
memory, including inferior-frontal and superior/middle-temporal cortex. Critically, the most strongly active region in the high memory load
condition (versus low load) was the left premotor and supplementary
motor cortex. Further analyses showed differential activation between
encoding and memory maintenance in temporal and parietal areas, but
equally strong engagement of prefrontal and motor systems. A degree of
category specificity emerged in the comparison between memory conditions; working memory for arm- vs. leg-related action words differentially activated superior vs. inferior frontocentral areas. These results
confirm the general role of the frontotemporal articulatory loop in verbal
working memory and rule out an epiphenomenal role of motor systems
in action word processing. In action-word memory, body-part related
action-perception loops may complement the function of the articulatory
loop.

cessed differently in the brain: Primes related to the figurative meaning
of an idiomatic expression elicited larger amplitude responses in eventrelated brain potentials (ERPs) like the N400 and the P600 compared to
primes related to the expression's literal meaning. In these studies, however, idioms were presented first and ERPs were measured from the
onset of a probe word presented later. It is unclear in how far the
observed results relate to early stages in idiom processing. In the current
study, an auditory prime was presented before an idiomatic sentence
was displayed to assess on-line processing. EEG responses were measured from the onset of the last phrase of an idiomatic sentence (e.g., 'Er
beißt / ins Gras.' He bites / the dust.). The prime word was related to the
literal or the figurative meaning of the idiomatic sentence (e.g., 'essen' eat
and 'sterben' die). Unrelated primes as well as ordinary sentences served
as a control condition. A simple verification task assured that participants read the sentence. Preliminary results showed a larger P600 for figuratively primed compared to literally primed idioms, most pronounced
at fronto-central electrode sites. A larger posterior N400 was observed
bilaterally for figuratively-primed idioms and idioms primed with an
unrelated word compared to idioms primed for their literal meaning.
Our findings indicate that the literal as well as the figurative meaning of
an idiomatic expression are semantically integrated already at an early
processing stage.

SCHEMAS MAKE SPATIAL RELATIONS VISIBLE FOR A PATIENT WITH
SIMULTAGNOSIA Alexander Kranjec1, Geena Ianni1, Anjan Chatterjee1;
1

University of Pennsylvania — Maps, graphs and diagrams compact a more
complex spatial reality into an easier-to-use model of the world by using
simplified graphic forms, like lines and blobs, to represent basic relations, like boundaries and enclosures. As such, a SCHEMA is an iconic
representation where perceptual detail has been abstracted away from
reality in order to provide a more flexible structure for cognition. Unlike
truly symbolic representations of spatial relations (i.e. prepositions) a
schema preserves some of the analog spatial qualities of the thing it
stands for. We tested the efficacy of schemas in facilitating the perception and understanding of spatial relations in a patient with bilateral
occipitoparietal damage and resulting simultagnosia. Patient EE555 performed six matching tasks involving WORDS (in, on, above, below),
photographic PICTURES of objects, and/or SCHEMAS depicting the
same spatial relations. For each task, EE555 was instructed to match a
single spatial relation to a corresponding image (picture or schema) from
an array of four choices. On the two tasks that did not include matching
to, or from, schemas (word-to-picture; picture-to-picture) EE555 performed at chance levels. For the tasks with schemas (schema-to-picture;
word-to-schema; schema-to-schema; picture-to-schema) performance
was significantly better, indicating that abstract analog representations
make spatial relations visible in a manner that symbols and complex
images do not. The results provide general insight as to how schemas
facilitate spatial reasoning when used in graphic depictions, and how
such theoretically intermediate representational structures could serve
to link perceptual and verbal representations of spatial relations in the
brain.

EXAMINING THE PROCESSING OF ACTION-RELATED EMBODIED
LANGUAGE IN TWO INDIVIDUALS POST RIGHT AND POST LEFT
HEMISPHERECTOMY Carrie Esopenko1, Crossley Crossley1, Nicole

Haugrud1, Borowsky Ron1; 1Department of Psychology, University of
Saskatchewan — Previous neuroimaging research has shown left hemi-

sphere (LH) dominance during the processing of language and semantic
information. Additionally, our lab has demonstrated that in a semantic
generation task, where participants verbalize how they would interact
with action-related stimuli, arm stimuli are processed bilaterally for both
pictures and words, whereas leg stimuli show LH dominance for pictures and words. The goal of our research was to examine how actionrelated language is processed in individuals post right or post left hemispherectomy. Based on this previous research we predicted better per-

240

formance in the individual with the intact LH, and better performance
with leg stimuli specifically during the semantic generation task. S.M.
(right hemispherectomy), J.H. (left hemispherectomy) and normal control participants completed naming and semantic generation tasks with
pictures and words. Our results showed evidence of a double dissociation. Specifically, the naming of picture leg stimuli showed that, relative
to controls, S.M. (intact LH) is severely impaired both in terms of
response times and accuracy, whereas J.H. (intact RH) shows performance that is close to that of the controls. For the semantic generation of
picture leg stimuli, relative to controls, J.H. (intact RH) is severely
impaired, whereas S.M. (intact LH) is close to the performance of controls. As such, we provide evidence regarding the necessity of the right
and left hemispheres for picture naming and semantic generation
respectively, whereby the right hemisphere is of critical importance for
picture naming, and the left hemisphere is of critical importance for the
semantic generation of action-related knowledge.

FMRI-BASED DECODING OF ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE CONCEPT
REPRESENTATION Jing Wang1, Laura Baucom1, Svetlana Shinkareva1;

University of South Carolina — Previously, multi-voxel pattern analysis
has been used to decode words referring to concrete object categories
(Just, et al., 2010; Shinkareva, et al., In press). In this work we investigated if single trial-based brain activity was sufficient to distinguish
abstract (e.g., mercy) vs. concrete (e.g., barn) concept representations.
Multiple neuroimaging studies have identified differences in the processing of abstract vs. concrete concepts based on the averaged activity
across time by using univariate method (Wang, et al., 2010). Here we
used multi-voxel pattern analysis to decode functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data when participants perform a semantic similarity judgment task (Breedin, et al., 1994). During event-related fMRI
scans, 13 participants performed the similarity judgment task on triplets
of words with similar meanings. Classifiers were trained to identify individual trials as concrete or abstract. Cross-validated accuracies for classifying trials as abstract or concrete were significantly above chance (p =
.05) for all participants. Discriminating information was distributed in
multiple brain regions. Moreover, accuracy of identifying single trial
data for any one participant as abstract or concrete was also reliably
above chance (p = .05) when the classifier was trained solely on data
from other participants. These results suggest abstract and concrete concepts differ in representations in terms of neural activity patterns during
a short period of time across the whole brain.

Arevalo1, Juliana Baldo1, Nina Dronkers1,2,3; 1VA Northern California Martinez,
2UC Davis, 3UCSD — The notion of embodied semantics suggests that processing linguistic stimuli referring to motor-related concepts recruits the
same sensorimotor regions of cortex involved in the execution and
observation of motor acts or the objects associated with those acts.
Twenty-seven patients with left-hemisphere lesions due to stroke and 10
matched controls were presented with pictures and words representing
objects and actions typically associated with the use of the hand, mouth,
foot or no body part at all (i.e., neutral). Picture-sound pairs were presented simultaneously, and participants were required to press a space
bar only when the item pairs matched (i.e., congruent trials). We conducted two different analyses: 1) we compared task performance of
patients with and without lesions in several key areas previously implicated in the putative human mirror neuron system (i.e., Brodmann areas
4/6, 1/2/3, 21 and 44/45), and 2) we conducted Voxel-based LesionSymptom Mapping analyses (VLSM) to identify additional regions associated with the processing of effector-related versus neutral stimuli. Processing of effector-related stimuli was associated with several regions
across the left hemisphere, and not solely with premotor/motor or
somatosensory regions. We also did not find support for a somatotopically-organized distribution of effector-specific regions. We suggest that,

rather than following the strict interpretation of homuncular somatotopy
for embodied semantics, these findings support theories proposing the
presence of a greater motor-language network which is associated with,
but not perfectly matched to, the network responsible for action execution and observation.

USING BRAIN LESION DATA AND VLSM TO EXPLORE EMBODIED
SEMANTICS AND THE HUMAN MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM Analia
Arevalo1, Juliana Baldo1, Nina Dronkers1,2,3; 1VA Northern California Martinez,
2UC Davis, 3UCSD — The notion of embodied semantics suggests that pro-

cessing linguistic stimuli referring to motor-related concepts recruits the
same sensorimotor regions of cortex involved in the execution and
observation of motor acts or the objects associated with those acts.

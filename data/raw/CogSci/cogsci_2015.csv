2015,"Applying for National Science Foundation Funding in Cognitive Science: Cognition, Computation, Development, Education, and Neuroscience","This half-day workshop will provide information and hands- on experience related to applying for National Science Foundation (NSF) funding in cognitive science. Program officers will discuss the NSF review process and NSF merit criteria. Details regarding a range of cognitive science research programs will be covered, including cognition, computation, development, education, and neuroscience. In addition, as an interactive activity, attendees will participate in simulated review panels using actual cognitive science grant proposals.",>Anne Cleary>Hector Avila-Munoz>Evan Heit>Chris Hoadley>Laura Namy>Alumit Ishai>Betty Tuller,>NSF>NSF>NSF>NSF>NSF>NSF>NSF,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0001/index.html
2015,Physical and Social Scene Understanding,"Computer vision has made significant progress in locating and recognizing objects in real images. However, beyond the scope of this “what is where” challenge, it lacks the abilities to understand scenes characterizing human visual experience. The mission of this workshop is to (a) identify the key domains in which human visual perception and cognition outperform computer vision; (b) formalize the computational challenges in these domains; and (c) provide promising frameworks for solving these challenges by conducting cognitive science and computer vision studies. We propose FPIC as four key domains beyond “what is where”: Functionality (e.g., what can be done with this slotted spoon?) Physics (e.g., will the spoon be able to pick up the meatball?) Intentionality (e.g., is the person trying to scoop up the cheese or point toward it?) Causality (e.g., why does the gravy pass through the spoon?)",>Tao Gao>Yibiao Zhao>Lap-Fai Yu,">MIT>UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, United States>University of Massachusetts",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0002/index.html
2015,"Language & common sense: Integrating across psychology, linguistics, and computer science","The language understanding that underlies state-of-the-art Internet search, machine translation, and dictation software is undeniably impressive. Equally undeniable is that these systems do not really understand language. What is missing? One candidate is common sense. Language is a mechanism for moving ideas from one mind to another -- ideas that are meant to be understood in the context of pre-existing, interlocking beliefs. Thus, fully exploiting its power may require sophisticated, explicit representations of world knowledge -- that is, common sense.",>Joshua Hartshorne>Joshua Tenenbaum,>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0003/index.html
2015,Evidence Accumulation Modeling: Bayesian Estimation using Differential Evolution,"Understanding decision making requires a dynamic approach that accounts for the time taken to make choices as well as the choices that are made. The success of the dynamic approach is underpinned by cognitive models, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM: Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008) and linear ballistic accumulator (LBA: Brown & Heathcote, 2005, 2008), that attribute decisions to an evidence accumulation processes. The ability of these models, and elaborations of them, to account for the speed and accuracy with which people make decisions across a broad range of tasks has led to an increasing number of applications in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience (for recent examples see Cassey, Heathcote & Brown, 2014; Heathcote, Loft & Remington, in press; Mittner et al., 2014; Turner, Van Maanen, Forstmann, in press).",>Andrew Heathcote>Brandon Turner Turner>Scott Brown,">The University of Tasmania>The Ohio State University>The University of Newcastle, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0004/index.html
2015,"Workshop on Optimizing Experimental Designs: Theory, Practice, and Applications","The accurate and efficient measurement of observations is at the core of empirical scientific research. To ensure measurement is optimal, and thereby maximize inference, there has been a recent surge of interest among researchers in the design of experiments that lead to rapid accumulation of information about the phenomenon under study with the fewest possible measurements. Statisticians have contributed to this area by introducing methods of optimizing experimental design (OED). The methodology involves adapting the experimental design in real time as the experiment progresses. The purpose of this full-day workshop is to introduce the principles underlying OED, illustrate how to apply OED in practice using widely and freely available software tools (e.g., R) to showcase applications of OED in areas such as cognitive psychology, education and assessment, and machine learning, and provide a platform to share work on OED.",>Jay Myung>Mark Pitt>Maarten Speekenbrink,>Ohio State University>Ohio State University>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0005/index.html
2015,Quantifying the Dynamics of Interpersonal Interaction: A Primer on Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis using R,"Over the last decade, the dynamics of interpersonal interaction has become a growing topic in cognitive science, precisely because of the important implications that interpersonal dynamics carry on shaping our ‘social cognitive system.’ Many important advances on this research topic have been possible through the application of concepts and statistical methods, which provide quantification for the dynamic structure of cognitive responses observed when individuals interact such as Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). In this tutorial, cognitive scientists from different fields, and at different stages of their career will learn a dynamical systems framework to interpret and understand interpersonal interaction, and acquire the analytical principles of C/RQA, which helps framing this approach.",>Moreno I.

2015,Programming online experiments with jsPsych,"This tutorial is an introduction to jsPsych, which is a free and open-source software package for creating experiments that run in a web browser.

2015,Tutorial: Bayesian data analysis,"Bayesian data analysis is superseding traditional methods in sciences from anthropology to zoology. Bayesian methods solve many problems inherent in p values and confidence intervals. More importantly, Bayesian methods are more richly and intuitively informative. Bayesian analysis applies flexibly and seamlessly to simple situations or complex hierarchical models and realistic data structures, including small samples, large samples, unbalanced designs, missing data, censored data, outliers, etc. Bayesian analysis software is flexible and can be used for a wide variety of data-analytic and psychometric models. This full-day tutorial presents a ground-level, hands-on introduction to doing Bayesian data analysis. The presenter is an award-winning teacher who has honed new materials from many previous courses. He has written an acclaimed textbook on the topic, now greatly expanded in its second edition. The tutorial materials include free software and numerous programs that can be used for real data analysis.",>John Kruschke,">Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0008/index.html
2015,Full Day Tutorial on Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision,"This tutorial covers the rapidly growing new approach to building computational models of cognition based on quantum theory. The cognitive revolution that occurred in the 1960’s was based on classical computational logic, and the connectionist movements of the 1970’s were based on classical dynamical systems. These classical assumptions remain at the heart of both cognitive architecture and neural network theories, and they are so commonly applied that we take them for granted and presume them to be true. What are these critical but hidden assumptions upon which traditional theories rely? Quantum theory provides a fundamentally different approach to logic, reasoning, probabilistic inference, and dynamical systems. For example, quantum logic does not follow the distributive axiom of Boolean logic, and quantum probabilities do not obey the disjunctive axiom of Kolmogorov probability. It turns out that humans do not obey these restrictions either, which is why we consider a quantum approach.",>Jennifer Trueblood>James Yearsley>Zheng Wang>Jerome Busemeyer,">University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, USA>City University, London, United Kingdom>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, U.S.>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0009/index.html

2015,Causality and Agency Across Cultures and Languages,"Why does wood float on water? What made Jim shout at me, and why had he to be so offending? Who is responsible for my son’s sickness? And why should incest be wrong? All these questions share one important feature: They ask for causal explanations. Causality is a core concept in our attempts to make sense of the physical world and of social interactions; and this makes causal cognition a topic of prime interest for cognitive science. Yet, in spite of an increasing body of high-quality and high-profile research, most previous studies paid only incidental attention to the potential of cognitive and linguistic diversity in causal cognition.",>Sieghard Beller>Andrea Bender>Jürgen Bohnemeyer>Annelie Rothe-Wulf>York Hagmayer>Rita Astuti,">University of Bergen, Norway>University of Bergen, Norway>University at Buffalo SUNY, USA>University of Freiburg, Germany>University of Göttingen, Germany>London School of Economics, London, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0011/index.html
2015,Communicating Cognitive Science: Improving Awareness and Understanding Among People Who are Not Ourselves,"As cognitive scientists, we invest enormous amounts of time in our graduate educations and careers learning to communicate our findings to others in the form of highly specialized research papers. Indeed, it is hard to imagine how the nuance and distinctions required to advance our science, or any science, could be communicated if such were not the case. However, our work is a public enterprise that is largely sustained by institutions that promise some return to the public good. In other fields, this return may be primarily in terms of ideas and insight into the human condition, as might be the case for archaeology and history. The return may be in new discoveries regarding our physical world, such as recent progress in nanomaterials that promise eventual translation into new forms of energy, transportation, and communication.

2015,Generative and Discriminative Models in Cognitive Science,"One popular distinction in machine learning is between discriminative and generative models (Ng & Jordan, 2001). Given the cross fertilization between research in human and machine learning, the time is ripe to ask whether the mind is a generative or discriminative learning device. This symposium tackles this question from a variety of perspectives. The aim is to explore the explanatory value of these two basic views of learning, which cut across existing distinctions in cognitive science (e.g., connectionist vs. Bayesian approaches).",>Brad Love>Michael Ramscar>Tom Griffiths>Matt Jones,">University College London>University of Tübingen>University of California, Berkeley>University of Colorado at Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0013/index.html
2015,Analogical Processes in Language Learning,"Language acquisition is a complex task, encompassing (at least) perception and categorization of phonemes, segmentation of speech, learning word meanings, and extracting morphological and syntactic regularities. The daunting nature of this task has led many to assume that a specialized module is required for language acquisition. Yet there is increasing evidence that general learning processes play a major role (e.g., Marcus et al, 1999; Saffran, Aslin & Newport, 1996). In this symposium we present the case that analogical comparison processes play an important role in language learning. We bring together empirical work addressing language acquisition in young children and second language learners, across three different levels of linguistic structure: phonology, lexical semantics, and syntax. Taken together, these studies suggest that analogical processes are important at every level of language learning.",>Bozena Pajak>Micah Goldwater>Dedre Gentner>Adele Goldberg>Ruxue Shao,>Northwestern.

2015,The Relevance of Alternative Possibilities throughout Cognition,"Research in a number of different fields has independently argued for the importance of providing a place for modality—that is, some way of representing alternative possibilities that could have happened, but actually did not (e.g., Kratzer, 2012; Lewis, 1973; Pearl, 2000). In each of these cases, the key insight has been that people’s understanding of the things that occur is shaped in some central way by their understanding of these alternative possibilities. Work throughout these fields has emphasized that people do not treat all alternative possibilities equally. Instead, they regard certain possibilities as relevant, while treating others as irrelevant (Portner, 2009; Roese, 1997). Within this research, one consistent theme has been that norms (statistical, moral, conventional, etc.) influence how these alternative possibilities are represented.",>Jonathan Phillips>Joshua Knobe>Andrew Shtulman>Charles Kalish>Anne Riggs>Christopher Hitchcock,>Harvard University>Yale University>Occidental College>University of Wisconsin Madison>University of Wisconsin Madison>California Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0015/index.html
2015,Eye-tracking situated language comprehension: Immediate actor gaze versus recent action events,"Visual-world eye-tracking findings suggest visual cues rapidly affect spoken sentence comprehension. When participants saw an actor perform an action and then listened to a related sentence (NP1-VERB-ADV-NP2), they preferentially inspected the “recent” over another “future” event target, and this even when future events were much more frequent. The current studies assessed to which extent this recent-event preference is modulated by another situation-immediate cue to the future event target (an actor’s gaze). Half of the sentences referenced a future event, and the experimenter performed one “recent” action before and one “future” action after the sentence. On 50% of the trials, he gazed at the future target object during the verb (Experiment 1) or at verb onset (Experiment 2). Results showed that gaze and future tense together cued attention to the future target; however gaze did not completely override the recent event preference.",>Dato Abashidze>Pia Knoeferle>Maria Nella Carminati,">Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster, Department of Linguistics Bielefeld University, Germany>Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster, Department of Linguistics Bielefeld University, Germany>Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster, Department of Linguistics Bielefeld University, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0016/index.html
2015,Effect of heaviness on the cognitive evaluation process,"The aim of this study was to clarify how the sense of heaviness changes our cognition. According to recent studies in cognitive science, intelligent human behaviors ranging from perception to inference are not closed mental processes; rather, they are affected by body and action (Wilson, 2002; Gibbs, 2005; Proffitt, 2006). In previous studies, the sense of heaviness activated concepts metaphorically related to heaviness, and changed impressions accordingly. However, previous studies have not distinguished between subjective heaviness and physical weight. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether changes in impressions are due to subjective heaviness or physical weight. To examine this issue, a psychological experiment using a tasting task was conducted. The results confirmed that subjective heaviness influences evaluations of price and value.",>Keiga Abe,>Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0017/index.html
2015,A Computational Approach to Modelling the Perception of Pitch and Tonality in Music,"The ability to extract meaningful relationships from sequences is crucial to many aspects of perception and cognition, such as speech and music. This paper explores how leading computational techniques may be used to model how humans learn abstract musical relationships, namely, tonality and octave equivalence. Rather than hard-coding musical rules, this model uses an unsupervised learning approach to glean tonal relationships from a musical corpus. We develop and test a novel input representation technique, using a perceptually-inspired harmonics-based representation, to bootstrap the model’s learning of tonal structure. The results are compared with behavioral data from listeners’ performance on a standard music perception task: the model effectively encodes tonal relationships from musical data, simulating expert performance on the listening task. Lastly, the results are contrasted with previous findings from a computational model that uses a more simple symbolic input representation of pitch.",>Kat Agres>Carlos Cancino>Maarten Grachten>Stefan Lattner,">Queen Mary, University of London, London>Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence>Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence>Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0018/index.html
2015,Do potential past and future events activate the Lateral Mental Timeline?,"We tested whether potential events are represented along the lateral mental timeline. In Experiment 1 participants categorized the temporal reference of either factual or potential events and responded by means of a lateralized keypress. Factual events replicated prior findings: participants were faster to categorize past events with the left hand and future events with the right hand than when using the opposite mapping. Mainly, this also ocurred for potential events. Experiment 2 replicated this finding using pure blocks of potential events. In order to assess the automaticity of the mental timeline, Experiment 3 asked participants to judge whether the expressions referred to factual or potential events. There was no space-time congruency effect. Instead, participants faster categorized potential events with the left hand and factual events with the right hand than when using the opposite mapping, suggesting for the first time a link between the mental representations of space and potentiality.",>Roberto Aguirre>Julio Santiago,>Universidad de la República>Universidad de Granada,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0019/index.html
2015,A Rational Model for Individual Differences in Preference Choice,"Human preference choice suffers curious contextual effects: the relative preference between two multi-attribute options (e.g. cars with differing safety and economy ratings) can dramatically shift, depending on the presence/absence of additional options. This phenomenon defies any simple utility-based account of choice, and has been taken to imply irrationalities/sub-optimalities in human decision-making, or reflect idiosyncrasies in neural processing. Recently, we used a Bayesian model to show that these contextual effects are normative consequences of observers’ using options to learn about the “market"". However, it had an unsavory implication that all decision-makers asymptotically converge to the same beliefs/behavior. Here, we propose a new model that uses both market and personal utilities to make choices. This model still captures the contextual effects, while also allowing asymptotic differences in individual preferences and providing a general framework for explaining how consumption informs one's beliefs and preferences.",>Sheeraz Ahmad>Angela Yu,">University of California San Diego, San Diego, California, United States>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0020/index.html
2015,Motion event expressions in language and gesture: Evidence from Persian,"How do people conceptualize motion events and talk about them? The current study examines how gestural representations of motion events arise from linguistic expressions in Persian, which has characteristics of both Talmy’s satellite- and verb-framed languages. We examined native Persian speakers’ speech and gestures in describing 20 motion events. We focused on two motion event components: path (trajectory of motion like up) and manner (how the action is performed like jumping). Results indicated that when expressing motion, Persian speakers produced path in both speech and gesture, whereas manner was conveyed only through speech (mostly as adverbs). Additionally, dynamic gestures tended to occur in the same order they were uttered. The difference between path and manner findings asks for further research to examine language-gesture interaction in detail among different languages. Results also suggest refinement in gesture theories that argue for one-to-one correspondence between speech and gesture.",>Niloofar Akhavan>Nazbanou Nozari>Tilbe Goksun,">Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore>Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0021/index.html
2015,Daxing with a Dax: Evidence of Productive Lexical Structures in Children,"In English, many words can be used flexibly to label artifacts, as nouns, or functional uses of those artifacts, as verbs (e.g., we can shovel snow with a shovel). Here, we examine whether young children form generalizations about flexibility from early in life and use such generalizations to predict new word meanings. In Experiment 1, we show that children spontaneously expected a novel verb referring to an action to also refer to the instrumental artifact used to perform that action. In Experiment 2, we show that this pattern extends to words that label novel actions involving novel artifacts, suggesting that children expect any word for an action to label the artifact that helps carry out that action. Experiment 3 traces how such generalizations may arise in development. In particular, we show that while four- and five-year-olds each expect words to label artifacts and their functions, three-year- olds may not.",>Sara Al-Mughairy>Ruthe Foushee>David Barner>Mahesh Srinivasan,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, San Diego>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0022/index.html
2015,Visuo-Spatial Memory Processing and the Visual Impedance Effect,"Models of spatial reasoning often assume distinct visual and spatial representations. In particular, the visual impedance effect – slower response time when more visual details are represented in three-term series spatial reasoning tasks – has been taken as evidence for the distinctive roles of visual and spatial representations. In this paper, we show that a memory model of spreading activation based on the ACT-R architecture can explain the visual impedance effect without the assumption of distinct visual and spatial representations. Using the same memory representation, varying levels of visual features associated with an object are represented in the model. The visual impedance effect is explained by the spreading activation mechanism of ACT-R. The model not only provides a more parsimonious explanation to the visual impedance effect, but also leads to testable predictions of a wide range of memory effects in spatial reasoning.",>Rebecca Albrecht>Holger Schultheis>Wai-Tat Fu,>University Freiburg>Universität Bremen>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0023/index.html
2015,Change your Mind: Investigating the Effects of Self-Explanation in the Resolution of Misconceptions,"We investigated the differential effects of self-explaining a refutational text, compared to thinking aloud or rereading. Undergraduate students (n = 105) read a refutational text about natural selection and were asked to either self-explain, think-aloud, or re-read the text. Then they completed a posttest that assessed general knowledge of natural selection. Students who self-explained the refutational text subsequently outperformed their peers on a test of their knowledge of natural selection. Additionally, the results suggest that both instructional and performance differences were significantly linked to the degree of causal cohesion present within students’ natural language responses to the text (i.e., self-explanations and think-alouds).",>Laura Allen>Danielle McNamara>Matthew McCrudden,">Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA>Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA>Victoria University of Wellington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0024/index.html
2015,Go fishing! Responsibility judgments when cooperation breaks down,"Many social judgments hinge on assigning responsibility to individuals for their role in a group's success or failure. Often the group's success depends on every team member acting in a rational way. When someone does not conform to what others expect of them, cooperation breaks down. We present a computational model of responsibility judgments for individuals in a cooperative setting. We test the model in two behavioral experiments where participants were asked to evaluate agents acting in a cooperative, one-shot game. In Experiment 1, we show that participants' action predictions are consistent with a recursive reasoning model. In Experiment 2, we show that people's assignments of blame are influenced by both an agent's presumed rationality, or adherence to an expected policy, as well as the pivotality of the agent's actions, or how close the situation was to one in which the action would have made a difference to the outcome.",>Kelsey Allen>Julian Jara-Ettinger>Tobias Gerstenberg>Max Kleiman-Weiner>Josh Tenenbaum,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, US>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0025/index.html
2015,Cognition in reach: continuous statistical inference in optimal motor planning,"We study the projection of cognitive representations into continuous motor (reaching) responses with a computational model that unifies three influential approaches: accumulation of evidence, statistical inference, and optimal feedback control. We modeled a number comparison task that asked participants to respond with a reaching gesture. The model successfully reproduced subjects' pattern of reach and performance across varying difficulties of numerical comparison. Our model parameterized several potentially relevant cognitive variables, including a threshold, memory decay, and mental sampling rate. Remarkably, a threshold for movement was not needed for modeling human behavior when statistical inference is combined with optimal motor planning. Overall, the model indicates that the motor-system positions the effectors optimally, both biomechanically through an optimal feedback controller, and cognitively by means of continuous statistical inference on the available evidence.",>Santiago Alonso-Diaz>Jessica F.

2015,Social Cues Affect Grasping Hysteresis in ASD,"Healthy development leads to a fluid integration of competing constraints. A marker of such behavior is hysteresis, reflecting a multi-stable system that takes into account its immediate history. The current study investigates patterns of hysteresis in typically developing children (TD) and those diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The task was to grasp and lift objects that increased in size, either from smallest to largest, or from largest to smallest. The objects could be picked up with one or two hands, marking a range of bi-stable behavior. Results of the grasping task showed hysteresis in TD children, whether or not the task was situated in the social context. In contrast, children with ASD showed hysteresis only in the non-social context. For both diagnostic groups, perseveration did not correlate to the degree of hysteresis, regardless of the presence or absence of social cues.",>Joseph Amaral>Heidi Kloos>Veronica Romero>Mike Richardson,">University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, United States>University of Cincinnati",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0027/index.html

Participants were shown not to discriminate between perspectives when the grammatical gender was congruent with their own sex, thus allowing for an agentive interpretation by the reader. However, in the gender-sex incongruent condition, a significant 83 ms effect of image perspective was observed indicating large processing costs for attempting to adopt an internal perspective when the participant’s sex was incompatible with the first-person gender marking, hence with action simulation from an egocentric perspective. These results are discussed in terms of embodiment specificity accounts and the experiential basis of grammar processing.",>Elena Andonova>Zornitsa Savcheva>Gergana Todorova,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0028/index.html
2015,Teaching Children to Attribute Second-order False Beliefs: A Training Study with Feedback,"There are several training studies that showed that it is possible to teach preschool children to pass first-order false belief tasks. However, the literature is missing analogous training effects for school-age children with respect to second-order false belief tasks. We focused on the role of feedback in the development of second-order false belief reasoning in two different conditions in 5- to 6-year-old children: (i) feedback with explanation, (ii) feedback without explanation. Children’s performance improved in both conditions. We argue that children who cannot yet pass the second-order false belief task reason about the false belief questions based on the reasoning strategy that they most frequently use in daily life (i.e. first-order or zero-order theory of mind). Moreover, we argue that children can revise their wrong reasoning strategy and change to the correct second-order reasoning strategy based on repeated exposure to the feedback “Correct/Wrong” together with the correct answer.",>Burcu Arslan>Rineke Verbrugge>Niels Taatgen>Bart Hollebrandse,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0029/index.html

2015,Adults Track Multiple Hypotheses Simultaneously during Word Learning,"Cross-situational learning is a basic mechanism that enables people to infer the correct referent for a novel word by tracking multiple hypotheses simultaneously across exposures. Previous research has shown that adults are capable of exploiting cross-situational information, but recently this gradual statistical learning mechanism has been put under debate by researchers who argue that people learn via a fast mapping procedure. We compared the performance of adult participants on a word learning task in which information was manipulated cross-situationally with the performance of simulated learning strategies. Experimental evidence indicates that adults use cross-situational learning, which appears to be a robust mechanism that facilitates word learning even under cognitively demanding circumstances.",>Suzanne Aussems>Paul Vogt,">University of Warwick, United Kingdom>Tilburg center for Cognition and Communication, the Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0031/index.html
2015,Applying Pattern-based Classification to Sequences of Gestures,"The pattern-based sequence classification system (PBSC) identifies regularly occurring patterns in sequential data and uses these patterns to predict meta-information. To illustrate the wide applicability of this approach, we classify speech-accompanying gestures produced by adults in order to predict their level of empathy. Previous research that focused on isolated gestures has shown that the frequency with which individuals produce certain speech-accompanying gestures is related to empathy. The current research extends these analyses by investigating the relationship between multi-gesture sequences and empathy. Patterns found in multi-gesture sequences prove to be more useful for predicting empathy levels in adults than patterns found in single gestures. This paper thus demonstrates that sequences of gestures contain additional information compared to gestures in isolation. More importantly, this study introduces PBSC as an effective method to incorporate time as an extra dimension in gestural communication, which can be extended to a wide range of sequential modalities.",>Suzanne Aussems>Mingyuan Chu>Sotaro Kita>Menno van Zaanen,">University of Warwick, United Kingdom>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, the Netherlands>University of Warwick, United Kingdom>Tilburg center for Cognition and Communication, the Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0032/index.html
2015,Explaining Injustice in Speech: Individualistic vs. Structural Explanation,"Implicit bias has recently gained much attention in scholarly attempts to understand and explain different forms of social injustice by identifying causally relevant mental states in individual’ minds. Here we question the explanatory power of implicit bias in a particular type of injustice, testimonial injustice, and more generally in what we call speech injustice. Testimonial injustice occurs when the audience deflates a speaker’s credibility due to the speaker’s perceived social identity (Fricker, 2007). We identify two drawbacks of a widely accepted explanation attributing testimonial injustice to prejudices (e.g. implicit bias) in the mind of the hearer, and argue that further understanding of this phenomenon can be gained from a structural explanation that appeals to discursive conventions and interlocutors’ positions in the communicative exchange.",>Saray Ayala>Nadya Vasilyeva,">San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California, United States>University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0033/index.html
2015,Does Training of Cognitive and Metacognitive Regulatory Processes Enhance Learning and Deployment of Processes with Hypermedia?,"In this study we examined the effectiveness of self-regulated learning (SRL) training in facilitating college students’ science learning with hypermedia. Sixty (N = 60) undergraduate students were randomly assigned to either a training condition or a control condition and used a hypermedia environment to learn about the circulatory system conducted overall several days. We collected self-report and performance data as well as concurrent think-aloud protocols throughout the various stages to training. Overall, there were no significant differences on several learning outcome measures between conditions. However, those in the training condition remembered significantly more declarative knowledge of cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Lastly, think-aloud protocol data showed significant differences in the use of the SRL processes immediately following training, but not following a 3-week interval on a hypermedia transfer task. The results have implications for the design of training methods and intelligent tutoring systems.",>Roger Azevedo>Amy Johnson>Candice Burkett,>North Carolina State University>Arizona State University>University of Illinois at Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0034/index.html
2015,Landmarks in motion: Unstable entities in route directions,"In the present study, we investigate if speakers refer to moving entities in route directions (RDs). On the one hand, there is a general agreement that landmarks are perceptually salient and stable objects. On the other hand, animated movement attracts visual attention, making entities intrinsically salient. In two experiments we tested to what extent people are prepared to use moving entities. Our results show that participants mention moving entities when the communicative setting affords such references (route directions as a joint communicative action) and when the movement is informative for the place where a turn should be taken.",>Adriana Alexandra Baltaretu>Emiel Krahmer>Alfons Maes,">TiCC, Tilburg University>TiCC, Tilburg University>TiCC, Tilburg University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0035/index.html
2015,A dynamic neural field model of self-regulated eye movements during category learning,"Computational models of category learning and attention have historically focused on capturing trial and experiment level interactions between attention and decision. However, evidence has been accumulating that suggests that the moment-to-moment attentional dynamics of an individual affects both their immediate decision-making processes as well as their overall learning performance. To extend the scope of these formal theories requires a modeling approach that can index fine-grained decision-making at millisecond time scales. Here we implement a model of eye movements during category learning using concepts from Dynamic Neural Field Theory research. Our model uses a combination of timing signals, spatial competition and Hebbian association to simultaneously account for a number of foundational attentional efficiency results from eye tracking and category learning. We report the results of fitting this model to accuracy, fixation probabilities, fixation counts and fixation duration data in 42 subjects from a standard category learning experiment.",>Jordan Barnes>Mark Blair>Paul Tupper>R Calen Walshe,>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0036/index.html
2015,Moral Dynamics In Everyday Life: How Does Morality Evolve In Time?,"Recent research on moral dynamics (the processes and phenomena by which moral behavior and moral attitudes emerge, evolve or disappear) shows that an individual’s ethical mind-set (i.e., outcome-based vs. rule-based) moderates the impact of an initial (un)ethical act regarding the likelihood of behaving ethically on a subsequent occasion. More specifically, an outcome-based mind-set facilitates Moral Balancing (behaving (un)ethically decreases the likelihood of engaging in the same type of behavior later), whereas a rule-based mind-set facilitates Moral Consistency (engaging in an (un)ethical behavior increases the likelihood of engaging in the same type of behavior later). We looked at the evolution of moral choice across a series of scenarios and explored if these moral patterns (Balancing–Consistency) were maintained over time. Three studies showed that Moral Balancing was not maintained over time while Moral Consistency could be sustained, if the mind-set was reinforced before making a new moral judgment (but not otherwise).",>Albert Barque-Duran>Emmanuel Pothos>James Yearsley>James Hampton,">City University London, London, United Kingdom>City University London>City University London>City University London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0037/index.html

First, 90 articles recently published in top social, developmental, and cognitive psychology journals were examined for their presentation of research hypothesis ‘risk’ – an element of the intellectual merit of a research study denoting the novelty and importance of the study being conducted. Second, an experimental study was conducted involving 82 students in undergraduate research methods classes. They were assigned to either argument diagram or traditional instruction conditions.

Prior developmental work suggests that even young children accurately recognize and evaluate under-informativeness. Building on prior work, we propose a Bayesian model of teacher evaluation that infers the teacher's quality from how carefully he selected demonstrations given what he knew. We test the predictions of our model across 15 conditions in which participants saw a teacher who demonstrated all or a subset of functions of a novel device and rated his helpfulness.

2015,Humans predict liquid dynamics using probabilistic simulation,"Liquids can splash, squirt, gush, slosh, soak, drip, drain, trickle, pool, and be poured--complex behaviors that we can easily distinguish, imagine, describe, and, crucially, predict, despite tremendous diversity among different liquids' material and dynamical characteristics. This proficiency suggests the brain has a sophisticated cognitive mechanism for reasoning about liquids, yet to date there has been little effort to study this mechanism quantitatively or describe it computationally. Here we find evidence that people's reasoning about how liquids move is consistent with a computational cognitive model based on approximate probabilistic simulation. In a psychophysical experiment, participants predicted how different liquids would flow around solid obstacles, and their judgments agreed with those of a family of models in which volumes of liquid are represented as collections of interacting particles, within a dynamical fluid simulation. Our model explains people's accuracy, and their predictions' sensitivity to liquids of different viscosity.",>Christopher Bates>Peter Battaglia>Ilker Yildirim>Josh Tenenbaum,">MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA>MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA; Google DeepMind London>MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA>MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0040/index.html
2015,The special status of color in pragmatic reasoning: evidence from a language game,"In current approaches to pragmatic reasoning the comprehension and production of referring expressions is modeled as a result of the interlocutors' mutual perspective-taking. While such models of pragmatic reasoning have been empirically validated in referential language games experiments, empirical (and computational) work on the generation of referring expressions has shown that speakers do not always take the listener's perspective into account, but instead produce referring expressions according to their own preferences. One particularly well studied example is color: speakers often include color terms in their referring expressions even if they do not help identify the intended referent. We show that like speakers, listeners treat color differently from other properties like e.g. size. Our results suggest that listeners do not seem to perform much pragmatic reasoning when the referring expression only expresses color, but instead follow a simple salience-based heuristic.",>Peter Baumann,>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0041/index.html
2015,"Folk Judgments of Normality: Part Statistical, Part Evaluative","Existing research has emphasized the importance of normality judgments in many aspects of cognition and life (e.g., causal cognition, gradable adjectives, cooperative behavior). Yet little work has explored how people actually come to understand what sorts of things are normal. We argue that people’s normality intuitions reflect a mixture of statistical and evaluative considerations. Specifically, we suggest that people’s intuitions about what is normal can be influenced by representations both of the average and of the ideal. We test this idea in three experiments. Experiment 1a demonstrates that explicit judgments of normality reflect this mixture of statistical and evaluative considerations. Experiments 1b and 2 then show that the hybrid notion that comes out in these explicit judgments can also explain people’s judgments about gradable adjectives. Taken together, these findings have potential implications not only for normality judgments themselves, but also for the many other mental activities that these judgments impact.",>Adam Bear>Joshua Knobe,">Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States>Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0042/index.html

We consider how the use of this information might change over the course of development. To this end, we represent the lexicon as either a phonological or semantic network and model the growth of this network. Constructing normative vocabularies from the Communicative Development Inventory norms, we utilize a preferential attachment growth algorithm. We predict and quantify the words which will be learned next, comparing the two network representations. We consider the effect of age, total vocabulary size and language ability as measured through CDI percentile. Our findings suggest that the semantic representation does not outperform the baseline bag-of-words model, whereas the phonological representation conditionally does. More generally, we show that the network representation influences the ability of a model to capture vocabulary growth. We further offer a method of analysis for testing representational assumptions in network models.",>Nicole Beckage>Ariel Aguilar>Eliana Colunga,>University of Colorado Boulder>Microsoft>University of Colorado Boulder,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0043/index.html

Past research has focused on characterizing population statistics of acquisition. We develop models that attempt to predict when a specific word will be learned by a particular child. The models are based on two qualitatively different sources of information: a representation describing the child (age, sex, and vocabulary skill) and a representation describing the specific words a child knows. Using longitudinal data from children aged 15-36 months, we construct logistic regression models to predict whether a word is learned in the coming month. Models based on child- or word representations outperform a baseline model. An ensemble that averages the predictions of the child- and word-feature models has significantly higher accuracy, indicating that the two sources of information are complementary. With this approach we gain an understanding of the factors that influence language learning, which should inform cognitive theories of development.",>Nicole Beckage>Michael Mozer>Eliana Colunga,">University of Colorado, Boulder>University of Colorado, Boulder>University of Colorado, Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0044/index.html

Despite potential concerns about the quality of crowdsourced data, we find no difference in the amount of between-language variation. We also replicate cognitive modeling experiments using the crowdsourced data in place of the fieldwork data. This suggests that crowdsourcing elicitations is a viable method for gathering data for semantic typology and cognitive modeling.",>Barend Beekhuizen>Suzanne Stevenson,>Leiden University>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0045/index.html
2015,The Role of Executive Functions for Structure-Mapping in Mathematics,"Comparing analogs is a key recommendation in mathematics instruction, but successful structure-mapping may impose high demands on children’s executive functions (EF). We examine the role of individual differences in EF resources on learning from an everyday mathematics video-lesson placing a particular strain on children’s cognitive resources: comparing three analogs presented sequentially. Specifically, we examine the separate contributions of working memory (WM) and inhibitory control (IC) on successful schema-formation. Overall, WM and IC explained distinct variance for predicting improvements in procedural knowledge, procedural flexibility, and conceptual knowledge after a 1-week delay. WM & IC are less predictive at immediate post-test, suggesting that these functions are not simply correlated with mathematics skill, but may be particularly important in the process of structure-mapping for durable schema-formation. These results inform the literature on both analogy and mathematics learning, extending previous findings implicating EFs as key for successful structure-mapping to an ecologically valid learning context.",>Kreshnik Begolli>Lindsey Richland>Susanne Jaeggi,">UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE, IRVINE, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA>UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0046/index.html

We describe a novel theory of omissive causation that posits that people build discrete mental simulations – mental models – of causal relations (Goldvarg & Johnson-Laird 2001). The theory states that causes by omission refer to a set of temporally ordered models of possibilities. Reasoners tend to focus on only one of those models, i.e., the possibility in which breathing does not occur and death subsequently does. Likewise, the theory posits that reasoners distinguish between omission in the context of causation, enabling conditions, and prevention. We describe some initial predictions made by the model-based account, contrast it with an alternative psychological theory based on the transmission of causal forces, and set out directions for further research.",>Paul Bello>Sangeet Khemlani,>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0047/index.html

Humans can identify in an image meaningful components almost everywhere, and identifying these components is an essential part of the visual process, and of understanding the surrounding scene and its potential meaning to the viewer. Detailed interpretation is beyond the scope of current models of visual recognition. Our model suggests that this is a fundamental limitation, related to the fact that existing models rely on feed-forward but limited top-down processing. In our model, a first recognition stage leads to the initial activation of class candidates, which is incomplete and with limited accuracy. This stage then triggers the application of class-specific interpretation and validation processes, which recover richer and more accurate interpretation of the visible scene.

This predicts a linear relationship between the meaning of intensifiers and their length and log-frequency. We test this prediction in two studies, using two different dependent measures, finding that higher cost does predict stronger meanings.

It also, however, achieves a high rate of accuracy on unstructured judgment problems, obtained from large quiz databases and from the popular game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire?.

Building on this research, we describe a new approach to parsing distributed representations via optimization over a set of soft constraints on the wellformedness of parse trees. This work extends previous research involving the use of constraint-based or ``harmonic''' grammars by suggesting how parsing can be accomplished using fully distributed representations that preserve their dimensionality with arbitrary increases in structural complexity. We demonstrate that this method can be used to correctly evaluate the wellformedness of linguistic structures generated by a simple context-free grammar, and discuss a number of extensions concerning the neural implementation of the method and its application to complex parsing tasks.",>Peter Blouw>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo (UW),https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0051/index.html

Our behavioral results demonstrate that participants with access to background knowledge (experts), overall performed significantly better than those without access to this knowledge (novices). More importantly, we show that experts rely more on relational features than surface features, an aspect that bag-of-words methods fail to capture.

Simulations of the TRACE model were used to derive preliminary predictions. Younger (N=15) and older (N=15) adults identified spoken words presented in moderate noise. Participants exhibited the standard inhibitory effect of phonological neighborhood density: slower recognition of spoken words from denser neighborhoods, with a larger effect for older adults. Most errors were phonological neighbors with few unrelated errors. However, the manipulation of cohort and rhyme density produced an unexpected reversal: the relative proportion of cohort vs. rhyme errors was biased toward cohorts when cohort density was low or when rhyme density was high, and toward rhymes when cohort density was high or rhyme density was low. These results are not consistent with the TRACE simulations and suggest a more complex pattern of lexical competition.",>Mona Roxana Botezatu>Jon-Frederick Landrigan>Qi Chen>Daniel Mirman,">Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA>Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA>South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China>Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0053/index.html
2015,Developmental Changes in the Relationship Between Grammar and the Lexicon,"How does abstract structure emerge during language learning? On some accounts, children's early syntax emerges from direct generalizations from particular lexical items, while on others, syntactic structure is acquired independently and follows its own timetable. Progress on differentiating these views requires detailed developmental data. Using parental reports of vocabulary and grammar abilities, previous analyses have shown that early syntactic abstraction strongly depends on the growth of the lexicon, providing support for lexicalist and emergentist theories. Leveraging a large cross-linguistic dataset, we replicate and extend these findings, demonstrating similar patterns in each of four languages. Moreover, the power of our dataset reveals that there are measurable effects of age over and above those attributable to vocabulary size, and that these effects are greater for aspects of language ability more closely tied to syntax than morphology. These findings suggest non-lexical contributions to the growth of syntactic abstraction that all theories must address.",>Mika Braginsky>Daniel Yurovsky>Virginia Marchman>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0054/index.html

The theory posits that decision-makers use fuzzy gist representations of the meaning of decision information, in parallel with precise verbatim representations of the exact wording of that information.

However it is not yet known what process produces these informative systems.

Signed languages appear to defy this pattern with frequent, long spans of simultaneous signing. But recent evidence suggests that turn boundaries in signed language may only include the content-bearing parts of the turn (from the first stroke to the last), and not all turn-related movement (from first preparation to final retraction). We tested whether signers were able to anticipate ``stroke-to-stroke'' turn boundaries with only minimal conversational context. We found that, indeed, signers anticipated turn boundaries at the ends of turn-final strokes. Signers often responded early, especially when the turn was long or contained multiple possible end points. Early responses for long turns were especially apparent for interrogatives---long interrogative turns showed much greater anticipation compared to short ones.",>Marisa Casillas>Connie de Vos>Onno Crasborn>Stephen C.

Young adults recognized faces better than older adults. Older adults’ recognition performance, on the other hand, correlated with their cognitive status assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Eye movement analysis revealed two different strategies, namely “analytic” and “holistic”. Participants using the analytic strategy had better recognition performance (particularly in the false alarm rate) than those using the holistic strategy. Significantly more young adults adopted the analytic strategy; whereas more older adults adopted the holistic strategy. Interestingly, older adults with lower cognitive status were associated with higher likelihood of using the holistic strategy.

A week later, participants were shown these videos, alongside another person's videos, for each task, and asked to recognize their own movements. Males recognized their own eye movements above chance, but only for tasks with large and familiar body movements. Females performed below chance.

2015,Chunking in Working Memory and its Relationship to Intelligence,"Short-term memory and working memory are two distinct concepts that have been measured in simple and complex span tasks respectively. A new span task was designed to manipulate a chunking factor while using a procedure similar to simple span tasks. This span task allowed studying the interaction between storage and processing in working memory, when processing is fully dedicated to optimizing storage. The main hypothesis was that the storage × processing interaction that can be induced by the chunking factor is an excellent indicator of intelligence because both working memory and intelligence depend on optimizing storage. Two experiments used an adaptation of the SIMON® game in which chunking opportunities were estimated using an algorithmic complexity metric. The results show that the metric can be used to predict memory performance and that intelligence is well predicted by the new chunking span task in comparison to other simple and complex span tasks.",>Mustapha Chekaf>Nicolas Gauvrit>Alessandro Guida>Fabien Mathy,">universite de Franche-Comté, Besancon, france>CHArt Lab (PARIS-reasoning), École Pratique des hautes Études, 4-14 rue Ferrus 75014 Paris, France>CRPCC, EA 1285, Université Rennes 2, Place du Recteur Henri Le Moal 35043 Rennes CEDEX, France>BCL, CNRS, UMR 7320, Université Nice Sophia Antipolis, 24, avenue des diables bleus 06357 Nice CEDEX 4, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0067/index.html
2015,Learning and Generalizing Cross-Category Relations Using Hierarchical Distributed Representations,"Recent work has begun to investigate how structured relations can be learned from non-relational and distributed input representations. A difficult challenge is to capture the human ability to evaluate relations between items drawn from distinct categories (e.g., deciding whether a truck is larger than a horse), given that different features may be relevant to assessing the relation for different categories. We describe an extension of Bayesian Analogy with Relational Transformations (BART; Lu, Chen & Holyoak, 2012) that can learn cross-category comparative relations from autonomously-generated and distributed input representations. BART first learns separate representations of a relation for different categories and creates second-order features based on these category-specific representations. BART then learns weights on these second-order features, resulting in a category-general representation of the relation. This hierarchical learning model successfully generalizes the relation to novel pairs of items (including items from different categories), outperforming a flat version of the learning model.",>Dawn Chen>Hongjing Lu>Keith Holyoak,">Department of Psychology, UCLA>Department of Psychology, UCLA;

These pauses provide a temporal signal that reflects the cognitive effort to process chunks. ‘Centre-click’ interaction with a mouse and response grid on a computer display is introduced as new technique for measuring the temporal chunk signal. Alternative pause measures and forms of normalization are explored.

2015,Statements of equivalence can imply differences: Asymmetries in directional comparisons,"Directional comparisons are often used to express similarity (e.g., “North Korea is like China”). These statements, however, frame the subject as the less typical figure and the complement as the more typical or prominent ground. Thus, despite expressing similarity, directional comparisons may imply that the ground is more representative. In Study 1, we analyze Twitter to show that directional comparisons occur in everyday conversation about gender; that men are the ground more often than women; and that only males frequently serve as the ground for positive traits (e.g., “Girls are as smart as boys”), suggesting that positive traits are considered typical of males, but not females. In Study 2, we show that directional comparisons intended to express equivalent ability (e.g., “Boys are as good as girls at a game called gorp”) cause adults to infer that the ground has more natural skill and that the figure has to work harder.",>Eleanor Chestnut>Carla Remulla>Ellen Markman,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA>Stanford University>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0070/index.html

The MNL has received support from various paradigms, but it remains controversial as it is challenged by alternative models. Here we used an individual differences approach to assess spatial-numerical associations (SNAs) across a variety of tasks. The MNL hypothesis predicts correlations across SNA tasks because they should tap a common MNL representation. Control tasks were included to account for effects not specific to SNAs. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations across several SNA tasks, even when controlling for general cognitive abilities or individual differences in response time (RT). These findings provide unique support for the MNL hypothesis, and begin to shed insight on potential explanations that may contribute to variation in the strength of the correlations among SNA tasks.",>Chi-Ngai Cheung>Vladislav Ayzenberg>Rachel F.

2015,Complex Mental Addition and Multiplication Rely More on Visuospatial than Verbal Processing,"Recent imaging studies have found that in simple arithmetic processing, addition is lateralized to the right hemisphere, whereas multiplication to the left. Here we aimed to investigate the cognitive mechanism underlying complicated arithmetic processing with a dual task paradigm. Participants were asked to complete a calculation task (addition or multiplication) and a letter judgment task (rhyme or shape judgment) simultaneously. We found that participants’ performance in addition and multiplication was interfered more by the simultaneous shape judgment task than the rhyme judgment task. This effect suggested that both complicated addition and multiplication relied more on right-lateralized visuospatial than left-lateralized phonological/verbal processing. The shift from left- to more right-lateralized processing in complicated multiplication suggests that participants may have adopted a visuospatial strategy to approximate numerosity when the calculation involved large numbers. These results suggest that the cognitive mechanism involved in arithmetic processing depends on both the operation and the context.",>Tommy Kwun Leuk Cheung>Janet Hui Wen Hsiao,>The University of Hong Kong>The University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0072/index.html

This knowledge can be expressed algebraically as ‘x + 1 > x’. In Experiment 1, 3- to 5-year-old children were asked to reason about transformations (i.e., addition, subtraction, rearrangement) performed on a visible set of objects. We found that 5-year-olds were able to reason about how each transformation affected numerosity, and 4-year-olds showed limited understanding. In Experiment 2, children were asked to reason about transformations performed on a hidden set of objects. Similar results were found. Together, we showed that the ability to reason about number algebraically develops gradually between the ages of 3 and 5.

We extracted typical health texts from multiple credible health websites, and systematically improved the texts in terms of, content, language, organization and design. Results showed that older adults better understood the revised passages than the typical ones, in terms of their reading efficiency (time per unit of information uptake). Intervention benefits were greater for older adults with more domain-specific health knowledge, suggesting that knowledge facilitated the comprehension of health information in the revised texts.

Participants performed a standard face recognition memory task with eye movements recorded. The durations and locations of the fixations were analyzed using HMMs for both the study and the test phases. Results showed that in the study phase, the participants who looked more often at the eyes and shifted between different regions on the face with long fixation durations had better performances. The test phase analyses revealed that an efficient, short first orienting fixation followed by a more analytic pattern focusing mainly on the eyes led to better performances. These strategies could not be revealed by analysis methods that do not take individual differences in both temporal and spatial dimensions of eye movements into account, demonstrating the power of the HMM approach.",>Tim Chuk>Antoni B.

2015,Expertise modulates hemispheric asymmetry in holistic processing: Evidence from Chinese character processing,"Holistic processing (HP) has been proposed to be a characteristic of right hemisphere (RH) processing. Here we test this claim using the divided visual field paradigm with Chinese character stimuli. HP is assessed through the composite paradigm, which is commonly used in perceptual expertise research. We found that in novice Chinese readers, a standard HP pattern emerged only in the left visual field/RH but not in the right visual field/left hemisphere, consistent with the analytic/holistic hemispheric dichotomy in the literature. However, in expert Chinese readers, neither visual field showed the HP pattern, consistent with the finding that reduced HP is an expertise maker for Chinese character recognition. Thus, the RH does not always employ holistic processing; it depends on the perceivers’ experience with the stimuli. This is the first study demonstrating that expertise with a visual object type can modulate hemispheric difference in HP.",>Harry K. S. Chung>Jacklyn C. Y. Leung>Janet H.

These factors might interactively contribute to scene memorability. Thus, we tracked computer-mouse movements during an encoding phase where participants verified the congruency of sentence and scene pairs, which varied in plausibility. The presentation time of the scenes was also manipulated. Subsequently, in an unexpected recognition phase, participants had to indicate whether they remembered scenes (old and new). Recognition improved when correct verifications were made during encoding especially: when the scene was implausible, the stimuli pair congruent, and for longer presentation times. When comparing the trajectories between encoding and recognition, we found greater hesitancy during encoding, especially for implausible scenes in incongruent pairs, decreasing as presentation time increased. These results provide novel insights into the factors modulating the memorability of naturalistic scenes.",>Moreno I.

2015,Are Biases When Making Causal Interventions Related to Biases in Belief Updating?,"People often make decisions with the goal of gaining information which can help reduce their uncertainty. However, recent work has suggested that people sometimes do not select the most diagnostic information queries available to them. A critical aspect of information search decisions is evaluating how obtaining a piece of information will alter a learner’s beliefs (e.g., a piece of information that is redundant with what is already known is useless). This suggests a close relationship between information seeking decisions on one hand, and be- lief updating on the other. This paper explores the deeper re- lationship between these two constructs in a causal interven- tion learning task. We find that patterns in belief updating bi- ases are predictive of decision making patterns in tasks where people must make interventions learn about the structure of a causal system.",>Anna Coenen>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0080/index.html
2015,That went over my head: Constraints on the visual vocabulary of comics,"“Upfixes” are graphic representations originating in the visual vocabulary used in comics where objects float above a character’s head, such as lightbulbs to mean inspiration. We posited that these graphic signs use an abstract schema stored in memory. This schema constrains upfixes to their position above the head and requires them to “agree” with the expression of their associated face. We asked participants to rate and interpret upfix-face pairs where the upfix was either above the head or beside the head, and/or agreed or disagreed with the face. Our stimuli also contrasted conventional and novel upfixes. Overall, both position and agreement impacted the rating and interpretations of both conventional and unconventional upfixes, and such understanding is modulated by experience reading comics. These findings support that these graphic signs extend beyond memorized individual items, and use a learned abstract schema stored in long-term memory, governed by particular constraints.",>Neil Cohn>Beena Murthy,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0081/index.html

While there has been long-standing evidence that people are sensitive to source characteristics, for example in the context of persuasion, exploration of the wider implications of source reliability considerations for the nature of our beliefs has begun only fairly recently. Likewise, much remains to be established concerning what factors influence source reliability.

What this means, why it is not a trivial lesson, and how it advances the literature on the epistemology of computer simulation are the three preoccupations addressed by the paper.",>Matteo Colombo,">Tilbug Center  for Logic and Philosophy of Science, University of Tilburg",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0083/index.html
2015,A Dissociation between Categorization and Similarity to Exemplars,"Research in category learning has been dominated by a ‘reference point’ view in which items are classified based on attention-weighted similarity to reference points (e.g., prototypes, exemplars, clusters) in a multidimensional space. Although much work has attempted to distinguish between particular types of reference point models, they share a core design principle that items will be classified as belonging to the category of the most proximal reference point(s). In this paper, we present an original experiment challenging this distance assumption. After classification training on a modified XOR category structure, we find that many learners generalize their category knowledge to novel exemplars in a manner that violates the distance assumption. This pattern of performance reveals a fundamental limitation in the reference point framework and suggests that stimulus generalization is not a reliable foundation for explaining human category learning.",>Nolan Conaway>Kenneth Kurtz,>Binghamton University>Binghamton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0084/index.html

What kinds of feedback from gesture—visual, proprioceptive, or both— drive these cognitive effects? Here we address this question using a test bed previously employed to explore gesture’s cognitive effects (Beilock & Goldin-Meadow, 2010). Participants solved the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, explained their solutions in speech and gesture, and solved the puzzle a second time. Previous studies using this paradigm have demonstrated that the gestures participants produce during the explanation phase affect their ability to solve the problem the second time. Unlike these prior studies, however, participants in the present study were blocked from seeing their hands while they gestured. Despite this absence of visual feedback, our results replicate previous studies in which visual feedback was available.

Currently, the solution to this accessibility problem is to produce text descriptions of visual graphics, which are then translated via text-to-speech screen reader technology. However, if a text description can accurately convey the meaning intended by an author of a visualization, then why did the author create the visualization in the first place? This essay critically examines this problem by comparing the so-called graphic–linguistic distinction to similar distinctions between the properties of sound and speech. It also presents a provisional model for identifying visual properties of graphics that are not conveyed via text-to-speech translations, with the goal of informing the design of more effective sonic translations of visual graphics.",>Peter Coppin>Peter Coppin,">Faculty of Design, OCAD University>Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0086/index.html

The results demonstrate that pain-sensitive people (based on their self-report) associate words more strongly with pain than less sensitive people. In particular, concrete nouns like syringe, wound, knife, and cactus, are considered to be more pain-related for those who are more pain-sensitive. We discuss our results in the light of three theoretical frameworks – cognitive bias, prototype theory, embodied account. We argue that the latter is best suited to explain the results of this study in the sense in which it implies the principle of body specificity, according to which different bodily characteristics lead to corresponding differences in the way in which people construct concepts and word meanings.",>Erica Cosentino>Markus Werning>Kevin Reuter,">Ruhr University Bochum>Ruhr Universtity Bochum, Bochum, NRW, Germany>Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0087/index.html

Displays included two Unrelated pictures, a Literal picture consistent with the literal interpretation of the adjective (an electrical socket), and a Metaphor picture consistent with the metaphorical interpretation (a report card). Sentences were divided into those with a preferred literal versus metaphorical reading of the adjective, and those preferences were predictive of looking behavior during the study.

2015,A Dynamic Approach to Secondary Processes in Associative Recognition,"Associative recognition has been attributed to the operation of a recall-like process that is not engaged during recognition of single items. An alternative mechanism is the formation of a compound memory cue that incorporates relational information between the elements of the association. These accounts make different predictions about the dynamics of associative recognition as revealed by speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) functions: if recall were operating, SAT functions should approach asymptotic performance at a faster rate for stronger associations. In a review of a literature, we find instead that only asymptotic performance, not rate, is affected by associative strength, consistent with a compound cue mechanism. We present a formal model of this mechanism as a direct outgrowth of a model of single-item recognition (Cox & Shiffrin, 2012) and use it to predict observed SAT curves for both single-item and associative recognition in a variety of experiments.",>Gregory Cox>Richard Shiffrin,>Syracuse University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0090/index.html

However, other studies find little sensitivity to or awareness of accent in young children. Three experiments reported here examine 3-5-year-olds’ comprehension of, and social decision-making with, a familiar (US English) accent and a foreign (Dutch) accent. Dutch accents were comprehended less well, particularly when salient phonological competitors were present, but social sensitivity was fairly weak until age 6-7 years.

2015,"Odor naming is difficult, even for wine and coffee experts","Odor naming is difficult for people, but recent cross-cultural research suggests this difficulty is culture-specific. Jahai speakers (hunter-gatherers from the Malay Peninsula) name odors as consistently as colors, and much better than English speakers (Majid & Burenhult, 2014). In Jahai the linguistic advantage for smells correlates with a cultural interest in odors. Here we ask whether sub-cultures in the West with odor expertise also show superior odor naming. We tested wine and coffee experts (who have specialized odor training) in an odor naming task. Both wine and coffee experts were no more accurate or consistent than novices when naming odors. Although there were small differences in naming strategies, experts and non-experts alike relied overwhelmingly on source-based descriptions. So the specific language experts speak continues to constrain their ability to express odors. This suggests expertise alone is not sufficient to overcome the limits of language in the domain of smell.",>Ilja Croijmans>Asifa Majid,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands

These models have traditionally been applied to empirical data using standard model-fitting methods like maximum likelihood estimation. We implement the GRT as a Bayesian latent mixture model to infer both qualitative individual differences in the types of decision bounds people use, and quantitative differences in where they place the bounds. We apply this approach to a previous data set with two category structures tested under different cognitive loads. Our results show that different participants categorize by applying diagonal, vertical, or horizontal decision bounds. Various types of contaminant behavior are also found, depending on the category structures and presence or absence of load.

Magnetoencephalography was localized to the cortical surface, showing that picture processing was initially bilateral or focused in the canonical left hemisphere language network, while single sign processing was initially focused in the right hemisphere. After 15 months of additional language experience, the neural responses to both pictures and single signs reversed in lateralization, becoming more similar to those observed in a control group of native signers.

In two experiments we presented observers with sequences of random 140x140 pixel arrays refreshing at 2.5Hz. In Experiment 1, observers were primed with a coherent motion pattern, such as fixed texture shifting up-and-down across frames. After 8 priming frames, the textures became completely random from frame to frame. Participants were instructed to indicate when they could no longer perceive the primed motion pattern. Participants' responses were delayed by an average of 6 frames (or 2.4 seconds).

2015,Evidence for widespread thematic structure in the mental lexicon.,"Semantic structure in the mental lexicon is often assumed to follow a taxonomic structure grouping similar items. This study uses a network clustering analysis of a massive word association dataset that does not primarily focus on concrete noun categories, but includes the majority of the words used in daily life. At this scale, we found widespread overlap between thematically organized clusters, arguing against a discrete categoric view of the lexicon. An empirical analysis focusing on taxonomic categories confirmed the widespread thematic structure even for concrete noun categories in the animal domain. Overall, this suggests that applying network clustering to word association data provides valuable insight into how large-scale semantic information is represented. This analysis leads to a different, more thematic topology than the one inferred from idealized small-scale approaches that sample only specific parts of the lexicon.",>Simon De Deyne>Steven Verheyen>Amy Perfors>Daniel Navarro,">University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia>University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0098/index.html
2015,"Behaviorist Thinking in Judgments of Wrongness, Punishment, and Blame","Moral judgment depends upon inferences about agents’ beliefs, desires, and intentions. Here, we argue that in addition to these factors, people take into account the moral optimality of an action. Three experiments show that even agents who are ignorant about the nature of their moral decisions are held accountable for the quality of their decision—a kind of behaviorist thinking, in that such reasoning bypasses the agent’s mental states. In particular, whereas optimal choices are seen as more praiseworthy than suboptimal choices, decision quality has no further effect on moral judgments—a highly suboptimal choice is seen as no worse than a marginally suboptimal choice. These effects held up for judgments of wrongness and punishment (Experiment 1), positive and negative outcomes (Experiment 2), and agents with positive and negative intentions (Experiment 3). We argue that these results reflect a broader tendency to irresistibly apply the Efficiency Principle when explaining behavior.",>Julian de Freitas>Samuel Johnson,">Oxford University, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom>Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0099/index.html
2015,Memory constraints affect statistical learning; statistical learning affects memory constraints,"We present evidence that successful chunk formation during a statistical learning task depends on how well the perceiver is able to parse the information that is presented between successive presentations of the to-be-learned chunk. First, we show that learners acquire a chunk better when the surrounding information is also chunk-able in a visual statistical learning task. We tested three process models of chunk formation, TRACX, PARSER, and MDLChunker, on our two different experimental conditions, and found that only PARSER and MDLChunker matched the observed result. These two models share the common principle of a memory capacity that is expanded as a result of learning. Though implemented in very different ways, both models effectively remember more individual items (the atomic components of a sequence) as additional chunks are formed. The ability to remember more information directly impacts learning in the models, suggesting that there is a positive-feedback loop in chunk learning.",>Josh de Leeuw>Rob Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0100/index.html
2015,Using a Task-Filled Delay During Discrimination Trials to Examine Different Components of Learned Visual Categorical Perception,"The evidence concerning the level at which learned CP effects occur is complex. The goal of this study was to use a different approach to this question by manipulating the abstractness of the information available for distinguishing pairs of items in an XAB task, and the presence or absence of a short task-filled delay between X and AB. Participants engaged in XAB trials containing a mixture of trials with and without the delay task before and after standard training to classify visual texture stimuli into two categories. Training improved discrimination of pairs differing on the category-relevant dimension whether within- or between-category, but not on pairs differing only on non-category relevant low level features. In addition, only successful learners in the post-training trials avoided decreased discrimination accuracy due to the delay task, suggesting that they formed more stable representations. However, this effect was not limited to pairs varying in category-relevant ways.",>Joshua de Leeuw>Jan Andrews,>Indiana University>Vassar College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0101/index.html
2015,Savvy software agents can encourage the use of second-order theory of mind by negotiators,"In social settings, people often reason about unobservable mental content of other people, such as their beliefs, goals, or intentions. This ability helps them to understand and predict the behavior of others. People can even take this ability further, and use higher-order theory of mind to reason about the way others use theory of mind, for example in 'Alice believes that Bob does not know about the surprise'. However, empirical evidence suggests that people do not spontaneously use higher-order theory of mind in strategic games. In this paper, we let participants negotiate with computational theory of mind agents in the setting of Colored Trails. We find that even though participants are unaware of the level of sophistication of their trading partner, within a few rounds of play, participants’ offers are more indicative of second-order theory of mind reasoning when their trading partner was using second-order theory of mind as well.",>Harmen de Weerd>Eveline Broers>Rineke Verbrugge,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0102/index.html

Yet there is to date a surprising lack of systematic investigation into the role of world knowledge in pragmatic inference. In this paper, we show that a state-of-the-art model of pragmatic interpretation greatly overestimates the influence of world knowledge on the interpretation of utterances like ""Some of the marbles sank"". We extend the model to capture the idea that the listener is uncertain about the background knowledge the speaker is bringing to the conversation. This extension greatly improves model predictions of listeners’ interpretation and also makes good qualitative predictions about listeners’ judgments of how ‘normal’ the world is in light of a speaker’s statement.

This paper presents and tests a novel account of the content of these ‘dual character concepts’.

We then present evidence that the normative dimension is a central dimension in the conceptual structure of dual character concepts.

2015,Modeling Relational Priming and Multiplicative Reasoning with Rational Numbers,"Previous research on multiplicative reasoning has shown that for whole numbers, understanding of division is linked to multiplication, as retrieval of division facts is often accomplished through reverse multiplication. We recently extended this research to rational numbers, and found that inverse multiplication problems can serve as primes for one another (e.g., a × b/a = a primes b × a/b = b) when the second multiplier is expressed as a fraction, but not when it is expressed as a decimal. In the current paper we propose a process model of how relational priming takes place, and report two experiments that test the effect. The first varies the format of the equations as fractions or division equation, and shows that priming is only observed using the fraction format; the second varies the multiplicative complexity of the factors in the equations, and shows that priming requires a common factor linking the problems.",>Melissa Dewolf>Miriam Bassok>Keith Holyoak,">University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States>University of Washington>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0105/index.html

In two computational studies we investigated whether word valence can be derived from sound features in English, Dutch and German. In Study 1, we identified whether individual phonological features explained valence scores per language separately. In Study 2, we aimed to determine the optimal combination of cues that can predict valence scores across the three languages using two statistical classifiers and four machine learning classifiers. Our results showed that frequency and word complexity were the most reliable shared cues to predict valence for all three languages, obtaining a correct valence classification of about 60%. This percentage could be enhanced for individual or pairs of languages using additional relevant cues. These findings demonstrated that the claim that sound-meaning relations are arbitrary is too strong.",>Karlijn Dinnissen>Max M.

Infants under 18 months of age in two different training conditions were either shown that two experimenters liked the same objects as each other or different objects. Following training, all infants were asked to share food with the experimenter. When infants were trained with two experimenters liking different objects, they later provided the experimenter with the food she liked; however, when infants were trained with two experimenters liking the same objects, they shared the food that they themselves liked.

2015,When high pitches sound low: Children’s acquisition of space-pitch metaphors,"Some languages describe musical pitch in terms of spatial height; others in terms of thickness. Differences in pitch metaphors also shape adults’ nonlinguistic space-pitch representations. At the same time, 4-month-old infants have both types of space-pitch mappings available. This tension between prelinguistic space-pitch associations and their subsequent linguistic mediation raises questions about the acquisition of space-pitch metaphors. To address this issue, 5-year-old Dutch children were tested on their linguistic knowledge of pitch metaphors, and nonlinguistic space-pitch associations. Our results suggest 5-year-olds understand height-pitch metaphors in a reversed fashion (high pitch = low). Children displayed good comprehension of a thickness-pitch metaphor, despite its absence in Dutch. In nonlinguistic tasks, however, children did not show consistent space-pitch associations. Overall, pitch representations do not seem to be influenced by linguistic metaphors in 5-year-olds, suggesting that effects of language on musical pitch arise rather late during development.",>Sarah Dolscheid>Sabine Hunnius>Asifa Majid,">University of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, NL>Center for Studies in Language, Radboud University, Nijmegen, NL",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0109/index.html

These results suggest that people rely to varying degrees on separable psychological processes. However, the relationship between these types of learning strategies has not been explored in any depth. This study investigated the relationship between feature- vs rule-based strategies in a causal learning task and indices of model-free and model-based choice in a two-step reinforcement learning procedure.

2015,Sound-Symbolism is Disrupted in Dyslexia: Implications for the Role of Cross-Modal Abstraction Processes,"Research into sound-symbolism has shown that people can consistently associate certain pseudo-words with certain referents; for instance, pseudo-words with rounded vowels and sonorant consonants are linked to round shapes, while pseudo-words with unrounded vowels and obstruents (with a non-continuous airflow), are associated with sharp shapes. Such sound-symbolic associations have been proposed to arise from cross-modal abstraction processes. Here we assess the link between sound-symbolism and cross-modal abstraction by testing dyslexic individuals’ ability to make sound-symbolic associations. Dyslexic individuals are known to have deficiencies in cross-modal processing. We find that dyslexic individuals are impaired in their ability to make sound-symbolic associations relative to the controls. Our results shed light on the cognitive underpinnings of sound-symbolism by providing novel evidence for the role —and disruptability— of cross-modal abstraction processes in sound-symbolic effects.",>Linda Drijvers>Lorijn Zaadnoordijk>Mark Dingemanse,">Radboud University Nijmegen, Centre for Language Studies, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0112/index.html

In this study, we examine the unintentional endorsement of conspiratorial beliefs as revealed in movement dynamics. We track the cursor movements of Republicans and Democrats as they click target regions on their computer screens, ostensibly providing bias-free opinions (e.g., clicking “FALSE” upon reading “Barack Obama was born in Kenya”). However, during these response movements, we find inhibition and movement attraction to regions of the screen where a competitor response is located (e.g., “TRUE” for the “birther” conspiracy). These dynamics are not present for general conspiracies or political knowledge items. Though both Republicans and Democrats show evidence of implicit biases, changes in the strength of competition also reveal key asymmetrical differences.",>Nicholas Duran>Stephen Nicholson>Rick Dale,">Arizona State University>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0113/index.html

Normative accounts suggest the utilities of options are fixed, but subjective accounts suggest utilities depend on context. In the current paper, we propose a novel model of choice that may help reconcile these accounts. We propose that choice behavior may depend on an ""Intentional Selection Assumption"": when people are presented with multiple options, they assume the options were intentionally selected by a person with specific questions in mind. Inferences about the intentional selection of options inform the chooser about the features that are intended to be most relevant. In this way, context can affect the desirability of a particular option, without requiring shifting utilities over features. Two behavioral experiments support the claim that participants are sensitive to intentional selection. We discuss the importance of taking choosers' assumptions about intentional selection into account in future investigations of choice behavior.",>Kelley Durkin>Leyla R.

However, students differ in their prior knowledge and cognitive skills and thus follow different learning pathways. We examined whether and how experimentation skills predict elementary students’ pathways of conceptual knowledge development in science education. First to sixth grade students (N = 1275) received 15 lessons of inquiry-based classroom instruction on the topic “floating and sinking”. Students’ experimentation skills were assessed before instruction. Their conceptual knowledge about floating and sinking was assessed before and after instruction. Latent profile transition analysis, a markov chain mixture model for continuous longitudinal data, revealed that students with higher experimentation skills were more likely to develop proficient and consistent knowledge of floating and sinking. We discuss theoretical implications of this finding, advantages of mixture models to examine conceptual knowledge development, and implications for science education in elementary school.",>Peter Edelsbrunner>Lennart Schalk>Ralph Schumacher>Elsbeth Stern,>ETH Zurich>ETH Zurich>ETH Zurich>ETH Zurich,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0115/index.html

Based on this principle, we examined whether more fluent speech production could be induced during dual tasks that engaged working memory (WM) while speech was produced. We also considered whether effects varied for speakers with different habitual degrees of attentional control during speech production. Twenty fluent adults and 19 adults who stutter performed (1) a baseline speaking task, (2) baseline WM tasks with various manipulations, and (3) dual tasks which combined the speaking task with WM conditions. Results indicated a fluency benefit under dual task conditions, which was specific to atypical disfluencies but comparable across speakers and WM manipulations. Findings suggest that WM is associated with atypical disfluencies and that suppressing these resources enhances speech fluency, although further research is needed to specify the cognitive mechanism involved in this effect.",>Naomi Eichorn>Klara Marton,>Pace University>The Graduate Center of the City University of New York,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0116/index.html

Results indicated that movement kinematics are necessary but not sufficient for sex detection and that race is detectable when movement is produced by Caucasians but not African Americans, and only when kinematic information is embedded in body structure.

We examine the possibility that both functions are supported by a common internal representation. First, we show that a model of ventral visual cortex only optimized to recognize objects in photographs generalizes to drawings of objects, suggesting that the capacity for visual abstraction is rooted in the functional architecture of the visual system. Next, we tested whether practice drawing objects might alter how those and other objects are represented. On each trial, participants sketched an object. The model then guessed the identity of the sketched object, providing real-time feedback. We found that repeatedly sketched objects were better recognized after training, while sketches of unpracticed but similar objects worsened. These results show that visual production can reshape the representational space for objects: by differentiating trained objects and merging other nearby objects in the space.",>Judith E.

This convergence appears to reflect dynamic interactions between lexical representations for the two languages. In this study, we present a self-organizing neural network model to simulate semantic convergence in the bilingual lexicon and investigate mechanisms underlying semantic convergence. Our results demonstrate that connections between two languages can be established through the simultaneous activations of related words in both languages, and these connections between two languages pull the two lexicons toward each other. These results suggest that connections between words in the bilingual lexicon play a major role in bilinguals’ semantic convergence.

This evolution brought new challenges, such as designing agents with personalities to the benefits of users. We endow artificial agents with regulatory focus, taking a socio-cognitive approach of personality, by using machine-learning techniques. We test whether this personality can be perceived by users and if there is a regulatory fit effect on the user’s credibility judgement of the agent (i.e. is the agent perceived as more credible if its regulatory focus is the same as that of the user?). Our results show agent’s regulatory focus can be adequatly perceived by users playing a board game against an agent expressing its regulatory focus via machine-learned strategies.

The present study explores this finding using an eye-tracking methodology. Eye movements from 41 participants were recorded while they read a thumbnail description and made a judgment on a statement comparing the probability of a single-event and that of a conjunctive event. Results showed participants focused more on the comparative probability statement under logico-heuristic conflict while they focused more the task description in the absence of conflict. Additionally, longer judgment latencies predicted higher rates of heuristic responding, which contradicts the original dual-process assumption that heuristic thinking in conjunction fallacy tasks is fast.",>Jenny Faure-Bloom>Gaëlle Vallée-Tourangeau>Sabira Mannan,>Kingston University London>Kingston University London>Kingston University London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0123/index.html

One proposal (Hawkins, 2004) suggests that language production system is organized to facilitate efficient parsing. We experimentally test this hypothesis using a miniature artificial language learning paradigm. Our findings support this account. Even though the input languages did not favor early placement of cues to grammatical function assignment (case and word order), participants used these cues in their own productions significantly more often in such a way as to allow early correct parsing commitments. This preference interacted with a bias to mark the less expected: Participants tended to use more case-marking in non-English OSV sentences.

Participants performed a lexical congruity task involving judging the semantic relatedness of a list of word pairs while listening to familiar classical music, unfamiliar classical music, or non-music environmental sound clips. Mind wandering episodes were probed randomly and intermittently for participants to self-report their mind wandering episodes during the task. Results showed that listening to familiar music is associated with faster response times and lower frequency of mind wandering. Whereas mind wandering episodes tend to be more frequent when participants listened to unfamiliar music. Implications from previous attention models and theories of music familiarity suggest that familiar music might increase task enjoyment without compromising behavioral performance.",>Shi Feng>Gavin Bidelman,>University of Memphis>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0125/index.html

We investigate timing changes in the temporal binding effect, which refers to a subjective shortening of the interval between actions and their outcomes. Two experiments investigated whether binding may be due to variations in the rate of an internal clock. Specifically, we asked whether clock processes in binding reflect a general timing system, or a dedicated clock unique to causal sequences. We developed a novel experimental paradigm in which participants made temporal judgments of either causal and non causal intervals, or the duration of an event embedded within that interval. While we replicated the temporal binding effect, we found no evidence for commensurate changes to time perception of the embedded event, suggesting temporal binding is effected by changes in a specific and dedicated, rather than a general clock system.",>Richard Fereday>Marc Buehner,>Cardiff University>Cardiff University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0126/index.html

Moreover, the few studies reported suggest that this kind of learning is especially sensitive to details of the experimental design. Here, we focus on 3- to 4-month-old infants (N=40) to identify both the origins of visual abstract rule learning in infancy and the conditions that best support it.

2015,Learning Exceptions in Phonological Alternations,"The present study explores learning phonological alternations that contain exceptions. Participants were exposed to a back/round vowel harmony pattern in which a regular suffix followed harmony, varying between /e/ and /o/ depending on the back/round phonetic features of the stem, and an exceptional suffix that was always /o/ regardless of the features of the stem vowel. Participants in Experiment 1 learned the behavior of both suffixes, but performance for the non-alternating suffix was higher when the suffix happened to adhere to vowel harmony. In Experiment 2, participants were exposed only to the same suffixes as Experiment 1, but the non-alternating suffix only appeared in harmonic contexts, creating ambiguity between exceptionality and alternation. Participants only correctly selected the non-alternating suffix when it appeared in a harmonic context.

In two experiments, suffixes were divided into three classes: high, medium and low frequency, based on the proportion of stems in the input that each suffix attached to (high frequency = 12/12, medium frequency = 6/12, and low frequency = 2/12). In Experiment 1, learners were better at segmenting words containing high frequency suffixes compared to low frequency suffixes, even when the stems were novel. In Experiment 2, token frequency was controlled for across all three suffix frequency classes, but learners were still better at segmenting high frequency suffixes, even when words containing high frequency suffixes were less frequent. These results suggest that learners are sensitive to the frequency distributions of the morphemes in their language, supporting work suggesting that a Zipfian distribution may be ideal for language learning.",>Sara Finley,>Pacific Lutheran University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0129/index.html
2015,ACT-R and LBA Model Mimicry Reveals Similarity Across Modeling Formalisms,"Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) and the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) were compared in a model mimicry simulation of the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), a simple, reaction time (RT) task requiring sustained attention. The models use different formalisms to capture the full response profile of the PVT. The parameters were varied systematically to illustrate the ranges of the models’ predictions, to assess the models’ estimation properties, and to determine which parameters in the models correspond with each other. Both models produced skewed RT distributions typical of empirical data, including false starts and lapses. The simulation study demonstrated that both models and their parameters are recoverable. Lastly, isolated parameters in the LBA model captured the effects of varying parameters in the ACT-R model, but the reverse was not always true. These interesting correspondences across different modeling formalisms suggest the possibility of integrating ACT-R and the LBA in future work.",>Christopher Fisher>Matthew Walsh>Leslie Blaha>Glenn Gunzelmann,">Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, USA>Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, USA>Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, USA>Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0130/index.html
2015,How Physical Interaction Helps Performance in a Scrabble-like Task,"An experiment tested the hypothesis that people sometimes take physical actions to help themselves solve problems. The task was to generate all possible words that could be formed from seven Scrabble letters. In one condition, participants could use their hands to manipulate the letters, and in another condition, they could not. Quantitative results show that more words were generated and lower frequency words were generated with physical manipulation than without. Qualitative results suggest that participants who could manipulate the letters tended to subdivide the task into smaller tasks (focusing on fewer letters at a time). Overall, our results can be explained in terms of an interactive search process in which external, physical activity effectively complements internal, cognitive activity, providing a reliable way to simplify search, explore the space of letter combinations, and identify potential words.",>Morgan Fleming>Paul Maglio,>UC Merced>UC Merced,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0131/index.html

However, little work has examined the factors that influence the folk psychiatry of addiction. Participants in the present study read a paragraph about addiction pitched at either an abstract or personal level, followed by a series of questions about the causes and treatment of drug addiction. We further manipulated whether addiction was described using a medical or psychological label. Results revealed that liberals and conservatives varied with respect to their folk psychiatric reasoning, with liberals preferring a biological/medical view, which is associated increased support for medical interventions and reduced feelings of personal responsibility. Framing addiction using medical labels and at an abstract level pushed people towards this biological view, suggesting that media reports and messaging campaigns may influence how people conceptualize addiction.",>Stephen Flusberg>Michael Dellavalle>Paul Thibodeau,">Purchase College, State University of New York, Purchase, New York>Purchase College, State University of New York>Oberlin College",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0132/index.html

We asked whether the speed of reaching related to the quality of visual information obtained by young children and adults. Participants played with objects on a table while their eye and hand movements were recorded. We developed new techniques to find reaching events in natural activity and to determine how closely participants aligned gaze to objects while reaching. Reaching speed and eye alignment were related for adults but not for children. These results suggest that adults but not children adapt reaching movements according to the quality of visual information (or vice-versa) during natural activity.

These figures consist of a global figure (a triangle or a square) made up of local figures (also triangles or squares). Both global and local figures can rotate in either clockwise or counterclockwise directions independently. We found that there is no right or left visual field perceptual advantage for either the global or local levels of these figures, as in Sergent (1982). We did, however, find a significant processing advantage for clockwise motion compared to counterclockwise motion. We also found a highly significant interaction between the detection of a particular rotational motion and the presence or absence of that motion in the figure being examined. Our data also strongly support the Global Precedence Hypothesis which says that people generally tend to focus on the global properties of an object before local properties.",>Bob French>Helle Lukowski-Duplessy>Cory Rieth>Gary Cottrell,">LEAD-CNRS, U. of Burgundy, France>LEAD-CNRS, U. of Burgundy, France>CSE Dept., UCSD>CSE Dept. 0404, UCSD",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0135/index.html
2015,Defaulting effects contribute to the simulation of cross-linguistic differences in Optional Infinitive errors,"This paper describes an extension to the MOSAIC model which increases MOSAIC’s fit to the cross-linguistic occurrence of Optional Infinitive (OI) errors. Previous versions of MOSAIC have successfully simulated OI errors as structures with missing modals or auxiliaries, but have underestimated their frequency in some languages. Here, we explore defaulting effects, where the most frequent form of a given verb is substituted for less frequent forms, as an additional source of OI-errors. Defaulting in English tends to result in the production of bare forms that are indistinguishable from the infinitive. In Spanish it is less pronounced, and tends to involve the production of 3rd person singular forms. Dutch verb forms are dominated by the stem in corpus-wide statistics, and the infinitive in utterance-final position, suggesting qualitative change in defaulting across development. Defaulting is argued to have the potential to simulate the cross-linguistic pattern of verb-marking errors in children with SLI.",>Daniel Freudenthal>Julian Pine>Gary Jones>Fernand Gobet,>University of Liverpool>University of Liverpool>Nottingham Trent University>University of Liverpool,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0136/index.html

We investigate the presence, temporal development, possible mechanisms and impact of interpersonal heart rate entrainment during collective creative LEGO construction tasks. We observe a statistically significant presence and increase over time of structured entrainment, which is found to be related to the actual unfolding and development of behavioral coordination. Heart rate entrainment does not predict rapport and perceived group competence, but behavioral coordination does. Physiological entrainment, thus, should not be considered a universal unmediated proxy for shared emotions, empathy and collective performance. Behavioral coordination – at least in tasks requiring forms of joint action – seems to be a more informative proxy for both physiological entrainment and collective experience.",>Riccardo Fusaroli>Johanne Bjørndahl>Andreas Roepstorff>Kristian Tylén,">Interacting Minds Centre, Aarhus University>Center for Semiotics, Aarhus University>Interacting Minds Centre, Aarhus University>Center for Semiotics, Aarhus University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0137/index.html

Listeners were as good at anticipating the synthesised voice as they were with human speakers (Experiment 1).

In this paper we investigate defeasible reasoning with quantified rules. In two experiments we rephrased conditionals from the literature (Experiment 1) and rules from penal code (Experiment 2) as either universal or existential rules and embedded them into Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens inference problems. We show that defeasible reasoning also exists for quantified rules. However, the kind of quantifier (universal vs. existential) did not affect inferences.

Recent work has developed models to handle compositionality, but these models have typically been evaluated on large, uncontrolled corpora. In this paper, we constructed a controlled set of phrase pairs and collected phrase similarity judgments, revealing novel insights into human semantic representation. None of the computational models that we considered were able to capture the pattern of human judgments. The results of a second experiment, using the same stimuli with a transformational judgment task, support a transformational account of similarity, according to which the similarity between phrases is inversely related to the number of edits required to transform one mental model into another. Taken together, our results indicate that popular models of compositional semantics do not capture important facets of human semantic representation.",>Samuel Gershman>Josh Tenenbaum,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0141/index.html

We propose a counterfactual simulation model (CSM) which predicts that causal judgments are influenced by whether a candidate cause made a difference to whether the outcome occurred as well as to how it occurred. We show how whether-causation and how-causation can be implemented as different counterfactual contrasts one the same generative model of the domain. We test the model in a physics domain where people make judgments about colliding billiard balls. Experiment 1 shows that participants’ counterfactual judgments are well-explained by an approximately Newtonian model of physics. In Experiment 2, participants judged to what extent two balls were causally responsible for a third ball going through a gate or missing the gate. As predicted by the CSM, participants’ judgments increased with their belief that a ball was a whether-cause, a how-cause, as well as sufficient for bringing about the outcome.",>Tobias Gerstenberg>Noah Goodman>David Lagnado>Josh Tenenbaum,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Stanford University>University College London>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0142/index.html

Here we focus on responsibility judgments in voting scenarios. We varied the number of people in different voting committees, their political affiliations, the number of votes required for a policy to pass, which party supports the policy, and the pattern of votes (creating 170 different situations). As expected, we found that participants’ responsibility judgments increased the closer the voter was to being pivotal. Further, judgments increased the more unexpected a vote was.

It has also been shown that humans are sensitive to shifts in this distribution, and will change predicted classifications based on these shifts. It is not immediately obvious what causes these shifts -- what specific properties of these distributions humans are sensitive to. Assuming a parametric model of human categorization learning, we can ask which parameters or sets of parameters humans fix after exposure to labeled data and which are adjustable to fit subsequent unlabeled data. We formulate models to describe different parameter sets which humans may be sensitive to and a dataset which optimally discriminates among these models.

However, a precise understanding of how disrupted attention negatively impacts learning is lacking. The present experiment expands upon the existing work and explores three potential mechanisms by which inattention may impede learning: 1) inattention may disrupt encoding of the individual features of the stimulus, 2) inattention may impede children from binding the features together, or 3) inattention may disrupt both feature encoding and binding.",>Karrie Godwin>Anna Fisher,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0146/index.html

The methods of the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) are used to construct the model. Accuracies and reaction times produced by the model are shown to match human data.

Such encoding effects might prevent positive transfer to problems sharing the same formal mathematical structure (Bassok, Wu, & Olseth, 1995). In this study with 5th and 6th graders, we investigated the conditions promoting positive and negative transfer in arithmetic problems that could be solved with two distinct strategies. We showed that basic training do not overcome the initial impact of semantic encodings, and we provided evidence that a poor semantic encoding of the training problems leads to transfer errors.

Using Bayesian graphical modeling methods, we apply the models to previous data involving 101 participants with large individual differences who completed sets of length 5 and length 10 problems.

Participants read instructions (containing this/that/my/your/the) to place objects at different locations. They then had to recall those object locations. Experiments 1 and 2 tested the contrasting predictions of two possible accounts of language on memory: the expectation model (Coventry, Griffiths, & Hamilton, 2014) and the congruence account (Bonfiglioli, Finocchiaro, Gesierich, Rositani, & Vescovi, 2009). In Experiment 3, the role of attention as a possible mechanism was investigated. The results across all three experiments show striking effects of language on object location memory; objects in the “that” and “your” condition were misremembered to be further away than objects in the “this” and “my” condition. The data favored the expectation model: expected location cued by language and actual location are concatenated leading to (mis)memory for object location.",>Harmen Gudde>Kenny Coventry>Paul Engelhardt,">University of East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, United Kingdom>University of East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, United Kingdom>University of East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0150/index.html

Participants were profiled in terms of working memory capacity, numeracy, math anxiety and expertise in math. All of these measures predicted calculation errors in the low interactivity condition; however, in the high interactivity condition, participants’ performance was not determined by any of these variables. We also developed a scale to measure task engagement: Participants were significantly more engaged with the task when they completed the sums in the high interactivity condition. However engagement level did not correlate with calculation error.

We explore the hypothesis that children have difficulty representing relevant alternatives; knowing what the teacher could have done. Children rated two teachers who demonstrated toys to a na\""{i}ve learner. One group first observed a fully informative teacher and then an under-informative teacher, while the other group saw the reverse order. Six- and seven-year-olds successfully rated the under-informative teacher lower than the fully-informative teacher regardless of the order (Exp.1). However, four- and five-year-olds showed this pattern only when they saw the fully informative teacher first (Exp.2). Given a binary choice after seeing both teachers, four-year-olds showed a preference for the fully informative teacher (Exp.3). We discuss these results in light of recent literature on children's understanding of pragmatic violations in linguistic communication; the contrast between the fully informative vs. under-informative teachers might help children understand what the teacher could have shown.",>Hyowon Gweon>Mika Asaba,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0153/index.html

They were asked to memorize at least one of the landmarks for providing a route description after the learning phase, either in the learning direction (initial path) or in the opposite direction (return path). In the allocentric experiment, a clear preference and higher performance was demonstrated for landmarks located at the position before the intersection and in the direction of turn, while in the egocentric perspective landmarks in the direction of turn were better remembered and used more frequently, independent of the position before or behind the intersection.

We combined a model of noisy physical simulation with a decision making strategy called the sequential probability ratio test, or SPRT (Wald, 1947). Our model predicted that people should use more samples when it is harder to make an accurate prediction due to higher simulation uncertainty. We tested this through a task in which people had to judge whether a ball bouncing in a box would go through a hole or not. We varied the uncertainty across trials by changing the size of the holes and the margin by which the ball went through or missed the hole. Both people’s judgments and response times were well-predicted by our model, demonstrating that people have a systematic strategy to allocate resources for mental simulation.",>Jessica Hamrick>Kevin Smith>Tom Griffiths>Ed Vul,">University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0156/index.html

The effect of providing a graph interpretation strategy, via a linguistic warning, on the encoding of long-term trends was then tested using eye tracking (Experiment 2).

In this paper, we formulate a family of increasingly sophisticated models of question-answer behavior within the Rational Speech Act framework. We compare these models based on three different pieces of evidence: first, we demonstrate how our answerer models capture a classic effect in psycholinguistics showing that an answerer's level of informativeness varies with the inferred questioner goal, while keeping the question constant. Second, we jointly test the questioner and answerer components of our model based on empirical evidence from a question-answer reasoning game. Third, we examine a special case of this game to further distinguish among the questioner models. We find that sophisticated pragmatic reasoning is needed to account for some of the data. People can use questions to provide cues to the answerer about their interest, and can select answers that are informative about inferred interests.",>Robert X.d.

2015,So good it has to be true: Wishful thinking in theory of mind,"In standard decision theory, rational agents are objective, keeping their beliefs independent from their desires. Such agents are the basis for current computational models of Theory of Mind (ToM), but this fundamental assumption of the theory remains untested. Do people think that others' beliefs are objective, or do they think that others' desires color their beliefs? We describe a Bayesian framework for exploring this relationship and its implications. Motivated by this analysis, we conducted two experiments testing the a priori independence of beliefs and desires in people's ToM and find that, contrary to fully-normative accounts, people think that others engage in wishful thinking. People's ToM therefore appears to be more nuanced than the current rational accounts, but consistent with a model in which desire directly affects the subjective probability of an event.",>Daniel Hawthorne-Madell>Noah Goodman,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0159/index.html

Experiment 1 found that a majority of participants failed to spontaneously search for information about an alternative hypothesis, even when this required minimal effort. This bias was reduced when a specific alternative was mentioned before search. Experiment 2 showed that when participants were given the likelihoods of the data given a focal hypothesis p(D|H) and an alternative hypothesis p(D|¬H), they gave estimates of p(H|D) that were consistent with Bayesian principles. The results show that neglect of the alternative hypothesis typically occurs at the initial stage of problem representation.

2015,Inferring the Tsimane’s use of color categories from recognition memory,"Knowledge of color has strong individual, environmental, and cultural differences that may systematically influence performance in cognitive tasks. For example, color knowledge has been shown to influence recall of color (Persaud & Hemmer, 2014). This manifests as a systematic regression to the mean effect, where memory is biased towards the mean hue of each universal color category. What remains unclear is whether differences, such as culture and environment, might differentially influence memory. We tested recognition memory for color in the Tsimane’ of Bolivia; an indigenous population with little or no modern schooling, whose environment is very different from industrialized societies. We found that recognition regressed towards the mean of some universal color categories, but for others was systematically biased toward neighboring categories. A cluster analysis suggested that the Tsimane’ use five underlying color categories—not the standard universals.

2015,New space-time metaphors foster new mental representations of time,"Can learning new linguistic metaphors foster new non-linguistic representations? We describe a set of studies in which we trained English-speaking participants to talk about time using vertical spatial metaphors that are novel to English. One group learned a mapping that placed earlier events above and the other a mapping that placed earlier events below. After mastering the new metaphors, participants were tested in a non-linguistic space-time implicit association task – the Orly task. This task has been used previously to document cross-linguistic differences in representations of time (Boroditsky et. al 2010; Fuhrman et al 2011). Some participants completed temporal judgments in the Orly task without any other secondary task, while others did so under either verbal or visual interference.

2015,Quantifying the time course of similarity,"Does the similarity between two items change over time? Previous studies (Goldstone & Medin, 1994; Gentner & Brem, 1999) have found suggestive results but have relied on interpreting complex interaction effects from “deadline” decision tasks in which the decision making process is not well understood (Luce, 1986). Using a self-paced simple decision task in which the similarity between two items can be isolated from strategic decision processes using computational modeling techniques (Ratcliff, 1978), we show strong evidence that the similarity between two items changes over time and shifts in systematic ways. The change in similarity from early to late processing in Experiment 1 is consistent with the theory of structural alignment (Gentner, 1983; Goldstone & Medin, 1994), and Experiment 2 demonstrates evidence for a stronger influence of thematic knowledge than taxonomic knowledge in early processing of word associations (Lin & Murphy, 2001).",>Andrew Hendrickson>Daniel Navarro>Chris Donkin,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0163/index.html
2015,A Computational Model of Mind Wandering,"We present a computational cognitive model of mind wandering, an important cognitive phenomenon whose mechanisms are involved in insight, problem-solving, and creativity. The model posits that mind wandering begins when one is not engaged in goal-oriented cognition, whether when between tasks or when in the middle of a task but not actively thinking about one's goal. At such times, the model thinks about other, highly-activated thoughts in memory. This model sheds light on both how task-oriented and more basic cognitive processes interact, as well as how mind wandering content is generated; both unresolved questions for mind wandering research. We compare our model against data presented by McVay & Kane (2013), who induced mind wandering in a laboratory setting by embedding participants' personal goals and concerns in a lexical SART task. Overall, our model matched the data's mind wandering rates very well. We discuss implications and future work on the model.",>Laura Hiatt>Greg Trafton,>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0164/index.html

2015,Sources of developmental change in pragmatic inferences about scalar terms,"Pragmatic implicatures—inferences that weak statements imply that stronger ones could not be used—are a popular case study of children’s pragmatic development. A growing literature suggests that children make implicatures under certain conditions, but their performance varies widely across tasks, and few datasets allow direct comparisons between implicature types. We designed a simple paradigm to address these issues. In Experiment 1, we included both ad-hoc (contextual) and scalar (quantifier) descriptions and found that 4-year-olds were at ceiling in ad-hoc trials but had difficulty with scalar implicatures. In Experiment 2, 4-year-olds’ performance increased when we included only scalar trials, but was still low. Across both datasets, performance for “some” and “none” quantifiers was positively correlated. Our work provides more precise developmental data on the emergence of different implicature computations and illustrates that preschoolers’ recognition of implicatures relates both to their comprehension of particular lexical items and also their recognition of relevant alternatives.",>Alexandra Horowitz>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0166/index.html

In many applications, this information has been ignored, either by using qualitative assessment of the function or by using a single summary statistic.

This fails to acknowledge or investigate what the interaction itself contributes. Using an online version of the Alternative Uses Task, we compare situations in which people are passively exposed to what is said in a dialogue, or actively engaged in the dialogue, thus varying interactivity independently of informational content. Interacting participants produce more turns overall, but do not come up with more ideas. They also build on each other's ideas more and produce more complex ideas when they do so; following leads to elaboration -- but only with genuine interactivity. These results indicate that conversational mechanisms promote the exploration of a problem space and that merely counting the number of ideas would miss the importance of the interaction itself.",>Christine Howes>Patrick Healey>Pietro Panzarasa>Thomas Hills,">University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden>Queen Mary University of London>Queen Mary University of London>Warwick University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0168/index.html

In Experiment 1, children carried out comparisons between characters’ thoughts and reality and between characters with true beliefs vs. those with false beliefs. Children given this training improved from pre- to post-test. In Experiment 2, we used a more minimal comparison technique. Children saw a series of three stories involving true or false beliefs. There were two between-subjects conditions that either facilitated (High Alignability) or impeded (Low Alignability) comparison across stories. We found that children made more gains from pre- to post-test in the High Alignability condition than in the Low Alignability condition. We also found effects of production of mental state verbs, as assessed in an Elicitation Task.

Preschoolers prefer to learn from previously accurate or competent sources, rather than from unreliable ones (e.g., Koenig, Clément, & Harris, 2004). The current study extends this work by comparing the ability to monitor an actor’s success in two species: children and chimpanzees. Members of both species saw two actors try to open containers, with different outcomes. Then, a forced-choice response was used to determine whether participants would pair the container with the previously successful actor. While preschoolers correctly elicited help from a previously successful actor, chimpanzees did not reliably select the type of object the actor could open. The current findings suggest a difference between humans and chimpanzees’ use of past source reliability, which may reflect or result from differences in their use of social learning.",>Melissa Hrabic>Bethany MacDonald>Michael Beran>Rebecca Williamson,">Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA>Georgia State University,  Atlanta, Georgia, USA>Language Research Center, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0170/index.html

When group numbers are equal, children choose boxes endorsed by informants with visual access over informants with hearsay (Experiment 1), but are at chance when group size conflicts with quality of knowledge (Experiments 2 and 3). This suggests that children tend to conform to a majority opinion, compared to adults (Experiment 4) and a normative computational model.

Taking a subject’s causal knowledge to be (implicitly) represented in terms of directed graphical models, the causal frame problem can be construed as the question of how to determine a reasonable ""submodel"" of one’s ""full model"" of the world, so as to optimize the balance between accuracy in prediction on the one hand, and computational costs on the other.

But naïve agents only choose what they believe they like best, and may end up disliking their choice. As such, sensitivity to an agent’s prior experience is critical for interpreting their behavior. Here we show that four- and five-year-olds expect knowledgeable agents, as compared to naïve agents, to have stable choices that lead to higher rewards (Experiments 1 and 2). Additionally, we show that four- and five-year-olds can infer which of two agents is naïve given information about the rewards they obtained and the stability of their choices (Experiments 3 and 4). These results show that young children understand that beliefs and desires are interconnected and that, in addition to having uncertainty about the world, agents can also be uncertain about their own desires.",>Julian Jara-Ettinger>Emily Lydic>Josh Tenenbaum>Laura Schulz,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0173/index.html

However, much of our social understanding goes beyond goal attribution. Drawing on both behavioral studies throughout development, and on the limitations of past models, we propose that humans have a naïve utility calculus to reason about the costs and rewards underlying agents’ goals. We show that the naïve utility calculus model, embedded in a Bayesian framework, can jointly infer the costs and rewards of agents navigating in complex scenarios. Using this model we test humans’ ability to make quantitative cost-reward inferences in scenarios with various sources of costs and rewards.

There is a correspondingly rich history of similarity research and many known behavioral trends and models of similarity. Nevertheless, most similarity behaviors have been identified and tested only in a comparatively narrow set of unique contexts. This leaves open the question of the extent to which similarity judgments rely on common processes or resources and the specific nature of those processes if so.

Specifically, I argue that top-down attention is required to provide informational integration at the level of the subject, which can be contrasted with integration at the level of features and objects. Since the informational content of conscious perception requires integration at the level of the subject, top-down attention is necessary for conscious perception as we know it. I present this argument through a theory, which I call the “Standard Theory.” According to this theory, top-down attention brings about subject-level integration for sensory input by prioritizing that input with respect to a subject-level standard.",>Carolyn Jennings,">University of California, Merced, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0176/index.html

However, speakers employ a variety of different language-specific expressions, which may encode culture-specific information about objects and/or different spatial concepts. We ask whether aspects of the encoding of spatial relations across languages nevertheless show common underlying spatial concepts as reflected in the distributions of spatial expressions over spatial sub-types. We examine a set of hypothesized distinctions within the spatial relational concepts of Containment and Support across three typologically distinct languages: English, Hindi, and Mandarin. We find support for two related hypotheses concerning common patterns of variation in (a) speakers' use of select ""basic"" spatial expressions, and (b) languages' inventory and distribution of expressions across hypothesized Containment and Support subtypes. The results underscore the presence of strong universal similarities in both the extension of basic spatial expressions across relations and in the principles governing the diversity of expressions available for encoding particular relations.",>Kristen Johannes>Jenny Wang>Anna Papafragou>Barbara Landau,">Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA>University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0178/index.html
2015,Predictions from Uncertain Beliefs,"According to probabilistic theories of higher cognition, beliefs come in degrees. Here, we test this idea by studying how people make predictions from uncertain beliefs. According to the degrees-of-belief theory, people should take account of both high- and low-probability beliefs when making predictions that depend on which of those beliefs are true. In contrast, according to the all-or-none theory, people only take account of the most likely belief, ignoring other potential beliefs. Experiments 1 and 2 tested these theories in explanatory reasoning, and found that people ignore all but the best explanation when making subsequent inferences. Experiment 3A extended these results to beliefs fixed only by prior probabilities, while Experiment 3B found that people can perform the probability calculations when the needed probabilities are explicitly given. Thus, people’s intuitive belief system appears to represent beliefs in a ‘digital’ (true or false) manner, rather than taking uncertainty into account.",>Samuel Johnson>Thomas Merchant>Frank Keil,">Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States>Brown University>Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0179/index.html

Three experiments tested whether people use pragmatist principles in fixing their beliefs, by examining situations in which the evidence is indeterminate between an innocuous and a dire explanation that necessitate different actions. According to classical decision theory, a person should favor a prudent course of action in such cases, but should nonetheless be agnostic in belief between the two explanations. Contradicting this position, participants believed the dire explanation to be more probable when the evidence was ambiguous. Further, when the evidence favored either an innocuous or a dire explanation, evidence favoring the dire explanation led to stronger beliefs compared to evidence favoring the innocuous explanation. These results challenge classic theories of the relationship between belief and action, suggesting that our system for belief fixation is sensitive to the utility of potential beliefs for taking subsequent action.",>Samuel Johnson>Greeshma Rajeev-Kumar>Frank Keil,">Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States>Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States>Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0180/index.html

Inductive reasoning tasks ask participants to determine how strongly a set of premises (e.g., Collies have sesamoid bones) imply a conclusion (Dogs have sesamoid bones). Here, we present evidence for an abductive theory of inductive reasoning, according to which inductive strength is determined by treating the conclusion as an explanation of the premises, and evaluating the quality of that explanation. Two inductive reasoning studies found two signatures of explanatory reasoning, previously observed in other studies: (1) an evidential asymmetry between positive and negative evidence, with observations casting doubt on a hypothesis given more weight than observations in support; and (2) a latent scope effect, with ignorance about potential evidence counting against a hypothesis.

The Bayesian approach to cognitive development holds that children evaluate explanations by applying a normative set of statistical learning and hypothesis-testing mechanisms to the evidence they observe. Here, we argue for certain supplements to this approach. In particular, we demonstrate in two studies that children, like adults, have a robust latent scope bias that conflicts with the laws of probability. When faced with two explanations equally consistent with observed data, where one explanation made an unverified prediction, children consistently preferred the explanation that did not make this prediction (Experiment 1). The bias can be overridden by strong prior odds, indicating that children can integrate cues from multiple sources of evidence (Experiment 2). We argue that children, like adults, rely on heuristics for making explanatory judgments which often lead to normative responses, but can lead to systematic error.",>Angie Johnston>Samuel Johnson>Marissa Koven>Frank Keil,">Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States>Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States>Emory University>Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0182/index.html

This interference is often studied using primary and interrupting task pairs. Evidence suggests that interruption interference can be reduced through practice by exposing individuals to many interruptions. However, evidence that this skill transfers beyond the tasks being trained is less clear. In particular, these practice effects may only occur when the same interrupting/primary task pairs are involved. A transfer paradigm was implemented to assess the transfer of interruption-recovery skill. Participants in separate conditions performed either the Tower of Hanoi or the Tower of London primary task during a training block and a transfer block of trials. Trials were interrupted by another task, and the primary measure was the time taken to resume the interrupted task. Significantly lower resumption times at the beginning of the transfer block lead to the conclusion that interruption recovery skill can transfer to novel tasks.",>Winston Jones>Jarrod Moss,">Mississippi State University, Starkeville, MS, United States>Mississippi State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0183/index.html

We tested MILA–T in a controlled experiment with 237 middle school students. We examine the impact of MILA–T on the models of a natural phenomenon constructed by the students. We find that students with access to MILA–T wrote better evidential justifications for their models, and thus, deliver better-justified models for the phenomenon. We also find that these improvements persisted during a transfer task.

We extend from an earlier word-invariant model by studying a model that marks words as prominent if the acoustic prosodic features differ from their expected values during the lexemes. To test the approach, the most common acoustic features associated with the perception of prominence are extracted and several lexeme-specific statistical measures are computed for each feature. Simulations are conducted on a corpus of continuous English speech and the algorithm output is compared to manually assigned prominence labels. The results show that the deviant prosodic descriptors of the words correlate with the perception of prominence. However, this effect is much smaller than that obtained by modeling the prosodic predictability at the utterance level, suggesting that context-independent lexeme-specific models are unable to capture relevant aspects of sentence prominence.",>Sofoklis Kakouros>Okko Johannes Räsänen,">Aalto University, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Espoo, Finland>Aalto University, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Espoo, Finland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0185/index.html

While there exist many theories and empirical findings about how people use and understand verbal irony, there is to our knowledge no formal model of how people incorporate shared background knowledge and linguistic information to communicate ironically. Here we argue that a computational approach previously shown to model hyperbole (Kao, Wu, Bergen, & Goodman, 2014) can also explain irony once we extend it to a richer space of affective subtext. We then describe two behavioral experiments that examine people's interpretations of utterances in contexts that afford irony. We show that by minimally extending the hyperbole model to account for two dimensions of affect---valence and arousal---our model produces interpretations that closely match humans'. We discuss the implications of our model on informal theories of irony and its relationship to other types of nonliteral language understanding.",>Justine Kao>Noah Goodman,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0187/index.html

The idea behind these debates seems to be that achieving a precise definition of these concepts will be a boon to scientific inquiry. We argue that these efforts of conceptual analysis would benefit from greater appreciation of the importance of such high-level concepts in supporting association or semantic priming, as opposed to deduction. In this associative role, they provide the basis for making connections between related concepts, connections that can then be explored by empirical methods, which in turn yield more precise, but often quite novel, concepts. In combination with well-established work in cognitive psychology on the non-classical structure of natural concepts, this perspective suggests that researchers should be cautious about investing substantial time and energy in attempts to precisely define concepts like COGNITION.",>Liam Kavanagh>Christopher Suhler,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0188/index.html

Kehler et al. (2008) and Kehler & Rohde (2013) have argued instead for a Bayesian model, according to which pronoun production is insensitive to a class of semantic and pragmatic biases that have been shown to influence interpretation. We evaluate the model using a passage completion study that employs a contextual manipulation to which traditional analyses are insensitive, specifically by varying whether a relative clause that modifies the direct object in the context sentence invites the inference of a cause. The results support the claim that pronoun interpretation biases, but not production biases, are sensitive to this pragmatic enrichment, revealing the asymmetry predicted by the Bayesian analysis. A correlation analysis further establishes that the model provides better estimates of measured pronoun interpretation biases than two competing models.",>Andrew Kehler>Hannah Rohde,">University of California, San Diego>University of Edinburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0189/index.html

A common explanation is that social learning, the learning mechanism underlying cultural transmission, enhances fitness by avoiding the extra costs of individual learning. This explanation was disproved by a mathematical model of individual and social learning, showing that social learners can invade a population but do not enhance its fitness. We extend this model to include a more complex environment, limited cognitive resources, and hybrid learners that combine social and individual learning. In this extended model, we show that social learning evolves and enhances population fitness via hybrid learners capable of specializing their individual learning.",>Milad Kharratzadeh>Marcel Montrey>Alex Metz>Thomas Shultz,">McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada>McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada>McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada>McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0190/index.html

Psychologists disagree about the representations that give rise to the different relations, but agree that mental simulations are fundamental in inferring them. We explore how causal relations are extracted from mental simulations. The theory of mental models posits that people use a kinematic simulation to infer possibilities. It predicts that causes should be easier to infer than enabling conditions, and that the latency to infer a causal relation should correlate with the number of moves in a simulation. To test these two predictions, we adapted a railway domain designed to elicit mental simulations, and we devised problems in which reasoners had to infer causal relations from simulations of movements of cars in this domain. Two studies corroborated the theory's predictions. We discuss the results in light of recent theories of causation and mental simulation.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Geoff Goodwin>Phil Johnson-Laird,>US Naval Research Laboratory>University of Pennsylvania>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0191/index.html

A dominant view is that they should revise their beliefs in a minimal way. An alternative is that the primary task is to explain how the inconsistency arose. One way individuals might violate minimalism is that to reject more information than is strictly necessary to establish consistency. Here, we show that reasoners exhibit such violations of minimalism: as a consequence of their causal knowledge, reasoners reject more information than is strictly necessary to establish consistency. This hypothesis predicts domino effects: when a fact contradicts an element early in an inferred causal chain, reasoners should tend to reject each subsequent event in the chain too.

2015,Development of Numerosity Estimation: A Linear to Logarithmic Shift?,"Young children's estimates of numerosity increase approximately logarithmically with actual set size. The conventional interpretation of this finding is that children's estimates reflect an innate logarithmic encoding of number. A recent set of findings, however, suggest logarithmic number-line estimates could emerge via a dynamic encoding mechanism that is sensitive to the prior distribution of stimuli. Here we test this idea by examining trial-to-trial changes in logarithmicity of numerosity estimates. Against the dynamic encoding hypothesis, first trial estimates in both adults (Study 1) and adults and children (Study 2) were strongly logarithmic, despite there being zero previous stimuli. Additionally, although numerosity of a previous trial affected adult estimates of numerosity, the nature of this effect varied across experiments, yet always resulted in a logarithmic-to-linear shift from trial-to-trial. These results suggest that a dynamic encoding mechanism is neither necessary nor sufficient to elicit logarithmic estimates of numerosity.",>Dan Kim>John Opfer,">The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A>The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0193/index.html
2015,The number of times a motion repeats influences sentence processing.,"We investigated how verbs’ semantics influences the way in which individuals process sentences and how well they remember the verb. Our study focused on the frequency of motion repetition, that is, how many times actions generally repeat in a row. Experimental sentences contained action verbs. A half contained verbs denoting actions that generally repeat once or twice in a row in the world (determined by norming; sneezing, coughing). The other half contained verbs referring to actions that typically repeat many times in row (hiccupping, clapping). Korean speakers performed a sensicality judgment task and decided whether Korean sentences were sensical. We also tested how well participants remember the verbs in target sentences. Results show an effect of repetition frequency: Participants judged sentences with low repetition frequency verbs more accurately than sentences containing high repetition frequency verbs. Verbs describing multiple repetitions may place a greater processing load than verbs involving fewer repetitions.",>Lucy Kyoungsook Kim>Elsi Kaiser,">University of Southern California, Los Angeles>University of Southern California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0194/index.html
2015,Effects of Emotional Prosody and Attention on Semantic Priming,"We use an auditory-visual semantic priming paradigm to investigate the effect of phonetically-cued emotional information (emotional prosody) on semantic activation of a lexical carrier. In two experiments, we show that words uttered in emotional prosody, although infrequent and atypical, do not necessarily hinder lexical access nor hamper subsequent semantic spread- ing, and that effects of emotional prosody on word processing crucially depend on the global context in which different types of prosody are presented. These results illustrate the complex nature of spoken word recognition and raise questions about how listeners incorporate multi-faceted information from spoken words.",>Seung Kyung Kim>Meghan Sumner,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0195/index.html
2015,Comparison and Function in Children's Object Categorization,"Although young children often rely on salient perceptual cues, such as shape, when categorizing novel objects, children shift towards deeper relational reasoning when they compare category members or attend to functional properties. In this study, we investigated the independent and combined effects of comparison and function in children’s categorization of novel objects. Across two experiments, we found that comparing two perceptually similar category members led children to discover non-obvious relational features that supported their categorization of novel objects. Together, these findings underscore the difficulty in categorizing novel objects but demonstrate that comparison may aid in this process by rendering less obvious relational structures more salient, thus inducing a shift towards a categorical rather than perceptual response.",>Katherine Kimura>Samuel Hunley>Laura Namy,">University of California, Berkeley>Emory University>Emory University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0196/index.html
2015,Voice-specific effects in semantic association,"Benefits to lexical access are provided by acoustically-cued speaker characteristics (such as gender and age), but little work has investigated these effects in meaning-based tasks. Word recognition is affected both by a word’s base-level activation and by associative spread of activation among words, and is correlated with speed of lexical access. In a free association task and a semantic priming task, we find off-line and on-line evidence of speaker-specific relationships between words. Our results suggest the need to extend existing models of spoken word recognition to include interactions between linguistic information and social information that is cued by variation in speech.",>Ed King>Meghan Sumner,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0197/index.html
2015,When Do Nonspecific Goals Help Learning? An Issue of Model Quality,"The three-space theory of problem solving predicts that the quality of a learner’s model and the goal specificity of a task interact on knowledge acquisition: Learners having a good model should learn more with a nonspecific than a specific goal, which should not apply to learners having a poor model. This study tested this prediction using a computer based learning task on torques. Participants (N = 77 psychology students) either had to test hypotheses with a simulation of a lever system (nonspecific goal), or to produce given values for variables in this simulation (specific goal). In the good model condition but not in the poor model condition they saw the torque depicted as an area. Results revealed the predicted interaction. A nonspecific goal only resulted in better learning when a good model of torques was provided but not with a poor model. Our findings support the three-space theory.",>Saskia Kistner>Bruce Burns>Regina Vollmeyer>Kortenkamp Ulrich,">Goethe-University, Institute of Psychology, Frankfurt, Germany>University of Sydney, School of Psychology, Australia>Goethe-University, Institute of Psychology, Frankfurt, Germany>University Potsdam, Institute of Mathematics, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0198/index.html
2015,Inference of Intention and Permissibility in Moral Decision Making,"The actions of a rational agent reveal information about its mental states. These inferred mental states, particularly the agent's intentions, play an important role in the evaluation of moral permissibility. While previous computational models have shown that beliefs and desires can be inferred from behavior under the assumption of rational action they have critically lacked a third mental state, intentions. In this work, we develop a novel formalism for intentions and show how they can be inferred as counterfactual contrasts over influence diagrams. This model is used to quantitatively explain judgments about intention and moral permissibility in classic and novel trolley problems.",>Max Kleiman-Weiner>Tobias Gerstenberg>Sydney Levine>Josh Tenenbaum,">Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139>Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139>Center for Cognitive Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854>Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0199/index.html
2015,Supervised and unsupervised learning in phonetic adaptation,"Speech perception requires ongoing perceptual category learning. Each talker speaks differently, and listeners need to learn each talker’s particular acoustic cue distributions in order to comprehend speech robustly from multiple talkers. This phonetic adaptation is a semi-supervised learning problem, because sometimes a particular cue value occurs with information that labels the talker’s intended category for the listener, but other times no such labels are available. Previous work has shown that adaptation can occur in both purely supervised (all labeled) and purely unsupervised (all unlabeled) settings, but the interaction between them has not been investigated. We compare unsupervised with (semi-) supervised phonetic adaptation and find, surprisingly, that adult listeners do not take advantage of labeling information to adapt more quickly or effectively, even though the labels affect their categorization. This suggests that, like language acquisition, phonetic adaptation in adults is dominated by unsupervised, distributional learning.",>Dave F. Kleinschmidt>Rajeev Raizada>T.

2015,2-year-olds use syntax to infer actor intentions in a rational-action paradigm,"Verbs may refer to the means (I bumped into the lamp) or outcome (I broke the lamp) of an action (cf. Rappaport Hovav & Levin, 2010; Talmy, 1985). Do young children expect language to encode this distinction? Children’s imitation patterns suggest that they analyze nonlinguistic events in these terms. When a head-touch is the simplest action available, toddlers include just the outcome, not the means, in their own imitation (Gergely, Bekkering, & Király, 2002). We ask whether syntax influences this inference. An experimenter with her hands occupied made a toy activate with a head-touch, using either Means-focused (I’m daxing to my toy) or Outcome-focused language (I’m daxing my toy). Toddlers then imitated the action. Means- but not Outcome-focus language encouraged children to include the distinctive head-touch, overriding the standard ‘rational imitation’ effect. This suggests that toddlers’ knowledge of argument structure includes an understanding of a means/outcome divide in verb meaning.",>Melissa Kline>Jesse Snedeker,>MIT>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0201/index.html
2015,Scene Inversion Slows the Rejection of False Positives through Saccade Exploration During Search,"The effect of face inversion has been heavily studied, whereas fewer studies have investigated inversion in scenes. We investigated the influence of scene inversion on decisions and contextual guidance of eye movements during visual search. A saccade contingent display termination paradigm was used to assess the temporal dynamics of the effect. Observers searched for a computer mouse in office scenes and performed a yes/no detection task. Observers’ sensitivity (d’) was lower for inverted images relative to upright. Observers’ false positive rate decreased with additional eye movements when they viewed upright images, but remained constant during the first three eye movements when viewing inverted images. The average distance of observers’ eye movements to the target location was greater for inverted than upright scenes. We interpret that inverting an image disrupts the rapid extraction of scene gist, subsequently disrupting guidance in eye movement behavior and slowing the process of rejecting false positives.",>Kathryn Koehler>Miguel P.

In this study we performed protocol analysis on a set of interview transcripts from an expert CTA practitioner to elicit the cognitive processes of conducting CTA interviews. We also consulted expert CTA practitioners to identify the strategies that they used during the interviews. We present key strategies that were employed by the expert CTA practitioners to ensure comprehensiveness and accuracy in the information collected, such as looking for perceptual cues (e.g. considering verbs such as “determine”) to ascertain adequacy of SME’s responses and selection of follow-up questions.

The study involves a remote speaker to verbally guide a listener and together they solved nine tasks. We collected a multi-modal dataset consisting of the videos from the listeners' perspective, their gaze data, and instructors' utterances. We analyse the changes in instructions and listener gaze when the speaker can see 1) only the video, 2) the video and the gaze cursor, or 3) the video and manipulated gaze cursor. Our results show that listener visual behaviour mainly depends on utterance presence but also varies significantly before and after instructions. Additionally, more negative feedback occurred in 2). While piloting a new experimental setup, our results provide indication for gaze reflecting both: a symptom of language comprehension and a signal that listeners employ when it appears useful and which therefore adapts to our manipulation.",>Nikolina Koleva>Sabrina Hoppe>Mohammad Mehdi Moniri>Maria Staudte>Andreas Bulling,">Embodied Spoken Interaction Group, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany>Perceptual User Interfaces Group, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany>German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Saarbrücken, Germany>Embodied Spoken Interaction Group, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany>Perceptual User Interfaces Group, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0204/index.html

However, all participants in these studies were only Japanese. We then investigated whether the ASEs are interpreted in the same way as with Japanese regardless of the users’ mother tongues; specifically we focused on three language categories in traditional phonological typology. We conducted a web-based experiment to investigate whether the ways speakers of German, Portuguese (stress accent language), Mandarin Chinese (tone language) and Japanese (pitch accent language) interpret the ASEs are different or not. The results of this experiment showed that the ways of interpreting did not differ, so this suggests that these ways are language-independent.",>Takanori Komatsu>Rui Prada>Kazuki Kobayashi>Seiji Yamada>Kotaro Funakoshi>Mikio Nakano,">Meiji University, Tokyo, Japan>INESC-ID, Portugal>Shinshu University, Japan>National Institute of Informatics>Honda Research Institute Japan>Honda Research Institute Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0205/index.html
2015,The better part of not knowing: Virtuous ignorance,"For cases in which precise information is practically or actually unknowable, certainty and precision can indicate a lack of competence, while expressions of ignorance may indicate greater expertise. In two experiments, we investigated whether children and adults are able to use this “virtuous ignorance” as a cue to expertise. Experiment 1 found that adults and children older than 9 years selected confident informants for knowable information and ignorant informants for unknowable information. However, 5-7-year-olds overwhelmingly favored a confident informant, even when such precision was completely implausible. In Experiment 2, we demonstrated that 5-8-year-olds and adults are both able to distinguish between knowable and unknowable items when asked how difficult the information would be to acquire, but those same children still failed to reject the precise and confident informant for unknowable items. We suggest that children have difficulty integrating information about the knowability of particular facts into their evaluations of expertise.",>Jonathan F. Kominsky>Philip Langthorne>Frank C.

In a behavioral study involving decisions-from-experience, Ashby, Konstantinidis, and Gonzalez (2015) showed that participants follow an “irrational” strategy in choice selection which departs from maximization. As structural complexity (number of available options) increased, participants diversified their choices more, proportional to rank ordering options based on their expected value.

The present experiment investigated whether the computational difficulty of production itself, which is known to affect what people say, can shape descriptions and subsequent event memory. Participants viewed simple scenes and were asked to describe them using either speech or silent gesture, the latter being a much more difficult task. We hypothesized that gesturing participants would over-use action pantomimes, which would yield poorer Inaction (vs. Action) scene memory. Following scene descriptions, participants were given a forced-choice recognition task to discriminate previously presented scenes from foils. Patterns of gesturing showed that gesturers used action pantomimes for Inaction scenes, and they performed reliably worse on Inaction scene memory. Increased production of action pantomimes predicted increased guesses for Action scenes at test, independent of the correct response.

In the first experiment we find that when items are repeated during study, blocked study results in higher test performance than interleaved study. In the second experiment we find that when there is no item repetition, interleaved and blocked study result in equivalent performance during the test phase. In the third experiment we find that when the study is passive and includes no item repetition, interleaved study results in higher test performance. We propose that learners create associations between items of the same category during blocked study and item repetition strengthens these associations. Interleaved study leads to weaker associations between items of the same category and therefore results in worse performance during test when there are item repetitions.",>Abigail Kost>Paulo Carvalho>Rob Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0210/index.html
2015,Can Modern Neuroscience Change Our Idea of the Human?,"The paper reviews the contribution of recent neuroscience findings to our understanding of human nature – more exactly, of the three properties that we conceive of as highly-specifically human: consciousness, freedom, and language. The analysis yields rather surprising results. Consciousness is not the highpoint of sophisticated cognitive functions, but primarily the basic pre-reflective self-other distinction intimately related to body control and affective states, within whose limits cognitive processes become possible. Freedom is not a violation of natural laws, but a necessary attribute of complex behavior rooted in fundamental biomechanical freedom of biological movements. Language comprehension is neither an instinct nor a set of inferences, but a behavior based on learnt hierarchy of predictive, anticipatory processes. The answer to the question formulated in the title is positive: yes, it can change. However, the direction of the change is at variance with that straightforward mechanistic kind of explanation that is publicly expected.",>Boris Kotchoubey,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, BW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0211/index.html

We know what features are predictive of collective intelligence in human groups, but we do not understand the specific mechanisms that lead to the emergence of this distributed information processing ability. In contrast, there is a well-developed literature of experiments that have exposed the mechanisms of collective intelligence in nonhuman animal species. We adapt a recent experiment designed to study collective sensing in groups of fish in order to better understand the mechanisms that may underly the emergence of collective intelligence in human groups. We find that humans in our experiments act at a high level like fish but with two additional behaviors: independent exploration and targeted copying. These distinctively human activities may partially explain the emergence of collective sensing in our task environment at group sizes and on times scales orders of magnitudes smaller than were observed in fish.",>Peter Krafft>Robert X.d.

From a processing standpoint, it remains unclear what happens when listeners encounter such utterances, and how they interpret them. We argue that uninformative utterances can trigger pragmatic inferences, which increase utterance utility in line with listener expectations. In this study, we look at utterances that refer to stereotyped event sequences describing common activities (scripts). Literature on processing of event sequences shows that people automatically infer component actions, once a script is 'invoked.' We demonstrate that when comprehenders encounter utterances describing events that can be easily inferred from prior context, they interpret them as signifying that the event conveys new, unstated information. We also suggest that formal models of language comprehension would have difficulty in accurately estimating the predictability or potential processing cost incurred by such utterances.",>Ekaterina Kravtchenko>Vera Demberg,">Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Saarland, Germany>Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Saarland, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0213/index.html

To investigate the determinants of spontaneous analogical transfer, solution rates to Duncker’s radiation problem were measured across varying source presentation conditions, and participants’ understanding of the source material was assessed. Supplemental animations increased both comprehension of the source analog and spontaneous transfer to the radiation problem. Supplemental diagrams yielded lesser improvement in participants’ understanding of source material and did not increase solution rates to the target problem. To investigate individual differences in spontaneous transfer, fluid intelligence was measured for each participant using an abridged version of the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) test.

We present a method for studying strategy development based on computational evolution that takes the opposite approach, allowing strategies to develop in response to the decision-making environment via Darwinian evolution. We apply this approach to a dynamic decision-making problem where artificial agents make decisions about the source of incoming information. In doing so, we show that the complexity of the brains and strategies of evolved agents are a function of the environment in which they develop. More difficult environments lead to larger brains and more information use, resulting in strategies resembling a sequential sampling approach. Less difficult environments drive evolution toward smaller brains and less information use, resulting in simpler heuristic-like strategies.",>Peter Kvam>Joseph Cesario>Jory Schossau>Heather Eisthen>Arend Hintze,">Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Department of Psychology, Michigan State University>Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University>Department of Integrative Biology, Michigan State University>Department of Integrative Biology, Michigan State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0216/index.html

Increasing evidence indicates that properties of the learning input have an impact on learning this type of recursion. Recent studies found that staged input, fewer unique exemplars and unequal repetition facilitate learning (e.g. Lai, Krahmer, & Sprenger, 2014; Lai & Poletiek, 2011, 2013). Most of these studies investigated learning center-embedded recursion through visual input, whereas few studies examined the processing of auditory input. In the current study, we test: 1) whether participants are able to learn center-embedded recursive structure from exclusively auditory input; 2) whether the facilitative cues (ordering and frequency distribution) are attuned to the auditory modality. Our results successfully demonstrate the learning of auditory sequences with center-embedded recursion, and replicated the effect with visual input in the previous study (Lai et al., 2014).",>Jun Lai>Emiel Krahmer>Jan Sprenger,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0218/index.html

In particular, deep convolutional neural networks currently outperform alternative approaches on standard benchmarks by wide margins and achieve human-like accuracy on some tasks. These engineering successes present an opportunity to explore long-standing questions about the nature of human concepts by putting psychological theories to test at an unprecedented scale. This paper evaluates deep convolutional networks trained for classification on their ability to predict category typicality -- a variable of paramount importance in the psychology of concepts -- from the raw pixels of naturalistic images of objects.

In addition to accuracy, one can evaluate claims based on quality. The current study investigates developmental change in learners’ evaluations of evidence that varies in quality—inductive strength based on typicality or diversity. We found that while younger children track which informant provides which examples, they do not have clear preferences for the informant who provides stronger examples. Older children, on the other hand, are in the middle of a developmental transition. They rate informants who provide inductively strong examples as more trustworthy, but only reliably choose the informant who provides diverse examples.",>Asheley Landrum>Joshua Cloudy>Patrick Shafto,">Annenberg Center for Public Policy, University of Pennsylvania>Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Louisville>Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Rutgers University-Newark",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0220/index.html
2015,Assessing Claims of Metaphorical Salience Through Corpus Data,"In the linguistic domain, conceptual metaphors have been shown to structure grammar, the lexicon, and abstract reasoning. Much recent research on conceptual metaphor comes from corpus examination, which is increasingly focused on developing quantificational tools to reveal co-occurrence patterns indicative of source and target domain associations. Some mappings between source and target are transparent. However, other metaphors, especially those that structure abstract processes, are more complex because the target domain is lexically divorced from the source. This study introduces new techniques directed at the quantitative evaluation of metaphorical salience when target and source relationships are nonobvious. Constellations of source-domain triggers are identified in the data and shown to disproportionately emerge in topic specific discourse. This measurement can be taken as one indicator of conceptual salience among the target speech community.",>Jenny Lederer,>San Francisco State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0221/index.html

However, it is unclear whether this apparent semantic alignment between the format of rational numbers and quantitative ontology is specific to the American education system, the English language, or measuring conventions (primarily imperial measures). Here we test whether similar alignments hold for Korean college students who differ from American students in educational background, language, and measurement conventions. Across three experiments, we found that the alignments found in the United States were generally replicated in South Korea. Relative to Americans, Korean students showed an overall bias towards using continuous representations, perhaps related to their exclusive use of the metric measurement system and to differences in instructional practice identified in a textbook analysis.",>Hee Seung Lee>Melissa Dewolf>Miriam Bassok>Keith Holyoak,">Yonsei Univerisity>University of California, Los Angeles>University of Washington>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0222/index.html

Our analyses examine the changes in accuracy resulting from the availability of the memory aid, the patterns with which people modify their lists when the aid is provided, and the stability of individual differences in the memory and decision-making processes involved.

Participants were given the MHD, followed by one of the three types of solutions, then we measured their level of conviction and their numeracy, Cognitive Reflection (CR), Need for Cognition (NFC), and Openness. Overall, both guided diagrams and simulated trials led to higher conviction compared to a simple solution statement. Higher numeracy and higher CR were associated with lower conviction after the simple solution; furthermore higher numeracy tended to help more in the simulation condition, whereas higher CR helped more in the guided condition. Therefore the persuasiveness of a solution depended both on its nature and characteristics of individual reasoners.",>Joanne Lee>Bruce Burns,>University of Sydney>University of Sydney,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0224/index.html

The results showed that changing the object identity (while retaining the numerosity) and changing the numerosity (while retaining the object identity) both resulted in attenuated recognition of object arrays. However, this interference differed across development. In adults interference was asymmetrical (i.e. changing the object identity has greater effect on memory for number than changed number had on object identity). In contrast, children showed a symmetrical pattern of interference. These results imply that for adults, representing perceiving numbers from a set of concrete objects might be an attention-demanding process compared to a spontaneous object process of representing objectsperception. Children, however, perceived neither the object identity nor numerosity independently.",>Saebyul Lee>Vladimir Sloutsky,">The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, Franklin>Ohio State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0225/index.html
2015,Measuring Time Gestures with the Microsoft Kinect,"Gestures related to time can reveal implicit representations of the TIME is SPACE metaphor (Núñez & Sweetser, 2006). While past research has shown that gestures illustrate the direction of future and past on timelines, no detailed analysis of timelines has been possible. Using the Kinect depth camera and body tracking technology, we tracked participants’ co-speech gestures while explaining time-related concepts. We present data collected with novel, relatively unsupervised Kinect-based methods that offer evidence similar to traditional gesture-coding methods and could provide the opportunity for novel theoretical findings.",>Daniel Lenzen,">University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0226/index.html
2015,If at First You Don’t Succeed: The Role of Evidence in Preschoolers’ and Infants’ Persistence.,"Perseverance, above and beyond IQ, predicts academic outcomes in school age children. Yet, little is known about how very young children learn the contexts in which persistence is valuable (or not). Here, we explore how young children and infants learn about the rational deployment of effort through observing adults’ persistent behavior. Results from Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that preschoolers persist more after watching an adult persist, but only if the adult is successful at reaching their goal. Experiment 3 extends these findings, showing that even infants use adult models to modulate their persistence, and can generalize this inference to novel situations. Thus, both preschoolers and infants are sensitive to adult persistence and use it to calibrate their own tenacity.",>Julia Leonard>Laura Schulz,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0227/index.html
2015,Visual Working Memory as Decision Making: Compensation for Memory Uncertainty in Reach Planning,"Limitations in visual working memory (VWM) have been extensively studied in psychophysical tasks, but not well understood in terms of how memory limits translate to performance in more natural domains. In particular, the current body of literature lacks a detailed account of how the physical consequences and costs of memory error influence what we encode in visual memory, and how we act on the basis of remembered information. We examined whether externally-imposed monetary costs influence behavior in a task that involves motor planning based on information recalled from VWM. Our results indicate that subjects accounted for the uncertainty in their visual memory, showing a significant difference in their motor planning when monetary costs were imposed for memory errors. However, our findings indicate that subjects’ memory representations per se were not biased by the imposed costs, but rather subjects adopted a near-optimal post-mnemonic decision strategy.",>Rachel Lerch>Chris Sims,>Drexel University>Drexel University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0228/index.html
2015,The reliability of testimony and perception: connecting epistemology and linguistic evidentiality,"Epistemologists have argued that there are three basic sources of belief: perception, testimony and inference. These three belief sources correspond directly to the way in which many languages mark statements morphologically for sources of evidence for the statements (evidentiality). In this paper, we connect generalizations from the fields of epistemology and evidentiality. We also introduce a new method for investigating how reliable people find different types of evidence to be. A study based on this method indicates that speakers of English rank different sources of evidence according to the same criteria that govern the use of grammaticalized evidential marking.",>Claire Lesage>Nalini Ramlakhan>Ida Toivonen>Chris Wildman,>Carleton University>Carleton University>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0229/index.html
2015,Linguistic input overrides conceptual biases: When goals don't matter,"Previous research has found support for a cognitive goal bias, which favors the linguistic and non-linguistic encoding of goals of motion over sources. The present corpus-based study explores the effects of goal bias during children's early naturalistic productions of come- and go-predicates. Lexically, come presupposes a goal, while go presupposes a source. This difference has been shown to lead adult speakers to inhibit goal-encoding for come (Gricean maxim of quantity). Young children, notoriously bad at handling deictic and pragmatic inference, could either mirror these patterns in the input or rely on the general cognitive goal bias during path-mapping. Results of two regression analyses suggest that (a) go exhibits a stronger goal bias than come for children and adults, and (b) children persist in inhibiting goals for come at rates similar to adults throughout their early linguistic development. Thus, linguistic input can trump domain-general conceptual biases in early lexical acquisition.",>Nicholas Lester,">University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0230/index.html
2015,Word order in a grammarless language: A ‘small-data’ information-theoretic approach,"David Gil has argued that Riau Indonesian (Sumatra. Indonesia) has no syntax, or at least not much. This controversial analysis undermines all current models of grammar, especially those describing acquisition and on-line processing. To test the strength of this analysis, we computed the information gain holding between unigram and bigram models of regular and randomized samples of English and Riau Indonesian. English samples were included as a relatively syntax-heavy baseline. We then correlated information gain values with language (English vs. Riau Indonesian), text type (original vs. randomized), and their interaction within a linear mixed-effects regression. The results suggest (a) that English and Riau Indonesian have the same amount of bigram informativity and (b) that randomization eliminates this effect in both languages. These findings do not support Gil’s syntax-free analysis; rather, they point to some kind of productive constraints on Riau Indonesian word order.",>Nicholas Lester>Fermin Moscoso del Prado Martin,">University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, USA>University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0231/index.html
2015,Constructional paradigms affect visual lexical decision latencies in English,"Previous research suggests that the probability distribution of a word across its inflected variants influences the recognition of that word. Recently, similar effects have been reported for relations between prepositions and definite-noun-phrase heads in English trigrams (e.g., in the bucket). We test whether both effects could be accounted for in terms of string proximity and/or semantic similarity alone, or whether the findings for English trigrams should be attributed to syntactic paradigm effects. We ‘fake’ a case system for English using syntactic positions and prepositions as proxies for the relational meanings expressed inflectionally in other languages. Based on these syntactic factors, we define a syntactic inflectional entropy to parallel the morphological entropy measures used in prior studies. We found that this new measure correlates negatively with visual lexical decision RTs. However, unlike prior studies, we did not find a semantic priming effect between nouns with similar distributions in our paradigmatic vectors.",>Nicholas Lester>Fermin Moscoso del Prado Martin,">University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0232/index.html
2015,"The Smell of Jazz: Crossmodal Correspondences Between Music, Odor, and Emotion","People can systematically match information from different senses, and these matches are known as crossmodal correspondences. Most work on these correspondences has explored how they might arise through neural mechanisms, statistical covariance in the environment, or semantic associations (e.g., Spence, 2011). Recently, Palmer, Schloss, Xu, & Prado-León (2013) demonstrated that at least some color-music correspondences can be explained by emotional mediation. The present study investigates the emotion mediation hypothesis for correspondences between odor and music, testing whether the strength of odor-music matches for particular odors and musical selections can be predicted by the similarity of the emotional associations with the odors and music. We found that perceived matches were higher when the emotional responses were similar and that a model including emotional dimensions captured a significant amount of the variance of match scores. These results provide new evidence that crossmodal correspondences are mediated by emotions.",>Carmel Levitan>Sara Charney>Karen Schloss>Stephen Palmer,">Occidental College>Occidental College>Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island>UC Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0233/index.html
2015,Structured priors in visual working memory revealed through iterated learning,"What hierarchical structures do people use to encode visual displays? We examined visual working memory’s priors for locations by asking participants to recall the locations of objects in an iterated learning task. We designed a non-parametric clustering algorithm that infers the clustering structure of objects and encodes individual items within this structure. Over many iterations, participants recalled objects with more similar displacement errors, especially for objects our clustering algorithm grouped together, suggesting that subjects grouped objects in memory. Additionally, participants increasingly remembered objects as lines with similar orientations and lengths, consistent with the Gestalt grouping principles of continuity and similarity. Furthermore, the increasing tendency of participants to remember objects as components of hierarchically organized lines rather than individual objects or clusters suggests that these priors aid the perception of higher-level structures from ensemble statistics.",>Timothy Lew>Ed Vul,">University of Californa, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America>University of Californa, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0234/index.html
2015,Conceptual complexity and the evolution of the lexicon,"Although natural languages are generally arbitrary in their mapping of forms to meanings, there are some biases. For example, longer words tend to refer to meanings that are more conceptually complex (a complexity bias; Lewis, Sugarman, & Frank, 2014). The origins of this bias remain an open question, however. One hypothesis is that this regularity is the product of a complexity bias in individual speakers, and that it emerges in the lexicon over the course of language evolution. In the present work, we use an iterated learning paradigm to explore this proposal. Speakers learned labels of varying lengths for objects of varying complexity, and then were asked to recall the labels. We then presented the labels that participants produced to a new set of speakers, iterating this procedure across generations. The results suggest a complexity bias that guides language change but that interacts with pressures for simplicity.",>Molly Lewis>Mike Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0235/index.html
2015,Music Reading Expertise Modulates Hemispheric Lateralization in English Word processing but not in Chinese Character Processing,"Recent research has shown that expertise in English and music reading both rely more on left hemisphere (LH) processing whereas Chinese character processing is more bilateral. Accordingly, music reading expertise may influence hemispheric lateralization in English word processing more than in Chinese processing due to stronger competition in LH processing. We recruited musicians and non-musicians in a divided visual field study of English word and Chinese character naming. In English word processing, whereas non-musicians showed a typical right visual field (RVF)/LH advantage, musicians showed a left visual field (LVF)/right hemisphere (RH) advantage. This effect may be due to competition for LH processing between music and English reading expertise, making musicians’ English word processing more right-lateralized. In contrast, in Chinese character naming, both musicians and non-musicians showed a similar bilateral pattern. Music reading experience may have differential influences on processing different languages, depending on their similarities in the cognitive processes involved.",>Tze Kwan Li>Janet H.

2015,Constraints on Learning Non-Adjacent Dependencies (NADs) of Visual Stimuli,"Non-adjacent dependencies (NADs) refer to dependencies between items that are not adjacent in a sequence. Peña et al. (2002) discovered adult participants could learn the NADs of syllables in an artificial language when there were 25ms pauses before and after the NADs. Studies using videos of human body movements showed similar learning outcomes (Endress & Wood, 2011). However, participants failed to learn the NADs with respect to non-linguistic acoustic stimuli, such as tones or noises (Gebhart, Newport, & Aslin, 2009). Four experiments in this study examined the constraints on learning the NADs of visual stimuli. We propose that acquisition of the NADs requires the sequences be packed into a coherent unit, and the motor system provides the require packaging for stimuli that can be mapped onto motor representation. Implications on the acquisition of syllable NADs are discussed.",>Jia Li>Toben Mintz,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0237/index.html

By container, we consider any physical object that can contain other objects, such as bowls, bottles, baskets, trash cans, refrigerators, etc. In this paper, we are interested in following questions: What is a container? Will an object contain another object? How many objects will a container hold? We study those problems by evaluating human cognition of containers and containing relations with physical simulation. In the experiments, we analyze human judgments with respect to results of physical simulation under different scenarios.

2015,When to use which heuristic: A rational solution to the strategy selection problem,"The human mind appears to be equipped with a toolbox full of cognitive strategies, but how do people decide when to use which strategy? We leverage rational metareasoning to derive a rational solution to this problem and apply it to decision making under uncertainty. The resulting theory reconciles the two poles of the debate about human rationality by proposing that people gradually learn to make rational use of fallible heuristics. We evaluate this theory against empirical data and existing accounts of strategy selection (i.e. SSL and RELACS). Our results suggest that while SSL and RELACS can explain people's ability to adapt to homogeneous environments in which all decision problems are of the same type, rational metareasoning can additionally explain people's ability to adapt to heterogeneous environments and flexibly switch strategies from one decision to the next.",>Falk Lieder>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0239/index.html

However, domains of knowledge where there is no consensus on the truth are likely to result in conflicting testimonies. Previous research has demonstrated that in these cases, learners look towards the majority opinion to make decisions. However, it remains unclear how learners evaluate social information, given that considering either the overall valence, or the number of testimonies, or both may lead to different conclusions. We therefore formalized several social learning strategies and compared them to the performance of adults and children. We find that children use different strategies than adults. This suggests that the development of social learning may involve the acquisition of cognitive strategies.",>Falk Lieder>Zi Lin Sim>Jane C.

Many models have developed from Expected Utility Theory to provide a thorough account of people’s subjective value and probability weighting functions. In particular, one such model that has been largely successful in both Psychology and Economics is Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). While these models do fit people’s choice behavior well, few models have attempted to provide a psychological account for subjective value, probability weighting, and resulting choice behavior. We focus on a memory confusion process as described in Hawkins et al.’s (2014) exemplar-based model for decisions from experience, the Exemplar Confusion model, and adapt it to account for biased probability estimates in decisions from description. We demonstrate that it is able to account for real choice data from a study using gains, losses, and mixed description-based gambles, and performs at least as well as CPT.",>Deborah Lin>Christopher Donkin>Ben Newell,>University of Melbourne>University of New South Wales>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0241/index.html

By varying the level of patient experience with the management of MS, we demonstrate the dependence of physician cognition on the patient’s contribution in four doctor-patient interactions. Experienced patients actively constructed clinical representations and presented initial evaluations for the doctor to refine and validate.

This paper describes two experiments that address this question, and extend prior related findings by drawing from a significantly more extensive list of concepts (over 1000) than has been used previously. In Experiment 1, participants communicated concepts to a partner using either gestures or non-linguistic vocalizations (sounds that are not words). Experiment 1 confirmed that participants who gesture 1) produce more strongly ‘motivated’ signs that physically resemble the concepts they represent (i.e., are iconic), 2) are better able to correctly guess the meaning of a partner’s signs, and 3) show stronger alignment on a shared inventory of signs. Experiment 2 addressed a limitation of Experiment 1 (concurrent feedback only in the gesture condition). In Experiment 2 concurrent feedback was eliminated from the gesture and vocal conditions. Gesture again outperformed vocalization on communication effectiveness and sign alignment.",>Casey J. Lister>Nicolas Fay>T.

One hypothesis argues that this iconicity has an effect on how linguistic structure emerges. However, exactly how and why these effects might come about is in need of empirical investigation. In this contribution, we present a signal creation experiment in which both the signalling space and the meaning space are manipulated so that different levels and types of iconicity are available between the signals and meanings. Signals are produced using an infrared sensor that detects the hand position of participants to generate auditory feedback. We find evidence that iconicity may be maladaptive for the discrimination of created signals. Further, we implemented Hidden Markov Models to characterise the structure within signals, which was also used to inform a metric for iconicity.",>Hannah Little>Kerem Eryılmaz>Bart de Boer,>Vrije Universiteit Brussel>Vrije Universiteit Brussel>Vrije Universiteit Brussel,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0244/index.html
2015,Can experience with different types of writing system modulate holistic processing in speech perception?,"Holistic processing (HP) is an expertise marker in visual perception; nevertheless, it can be modulated by writing experience (Tso, Au, & Hsiao, 2014). We have recently found that HP also indicates expertise in Cantonese speech perception (Liu & Hsiao, 2014). Nevertheless, Cantonese has a logographic writing system where one syllable corresponds to one character, whereas in alphabetic languages, each syllable can be decomposed into phonemes that correspond to letters. This distinction between logographic and alphabetic languages may also modulate HP effects in speech perception. Here we tested HP effects through the composite paradigm with Korean syllables. In contrast to Cantonese speech perception, native Korean speakers were less holistic than novices in Korean syllable perception. Thus, experience with an alphabetic language may promote analytic processing of its spoken syllables. Similar to visual perception, our results suggest that HP as an expertise marker in speech perception depends on the listeners’ learning experience.",>Tianyin Liu>Janet Hsiao,>University of Hong Kong>University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0245/index.html

However, recent studies have shown that the two numerical systems are more distinct than previously thought. These disparate findings may be explained by the use of sequential presentations of symbolic and non-symbolic quantities, the use of magnitude-reliant tasks, or the use of limited number ranges. We investigated whether adults integrate symbolic and non-symbolic numerical information during a non-magnitude-based task in which symbolic and non-symbolic double-digit numerical information is shown simultaneously. Participants viewed images in which symbolic numerals or letter pairs were superimposed on non-symbolic numerical stimuli and were asked to determine whether the text was a numeral or letter, ignoring the dots. After perceptual biases were taken into account, participants were more accurate and faster in their judgments when symbolic and non-symbolic information matched than when information mismatched, suggesting that adults can integrate symbolic and non-symbolic numerical information.",>Allison Liu>Christian Schunn>Julie Fiez>Melissa Libertus,">University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0246/index.html

Computational Cognitive Architectures (CCAs) provide researchers with a concrete medium for connecting different cognitive theories to facilitate development of a robust, unambiguous UTC. However, due to wide dissemination of research effort, and broad scope of cognition as a psychological science, keeping track of CCA contributions is difficult. We compare the structuring of long-term memory (LTM) in two CCAs: ACT-R and CHREST. LTM structuring is considered in particular since it is an essential component of CCAs and underpins most of their operations. We aim to consolidate knowledge regarding LTM structuring for these CCA's and identify similarities and differences between their approaches.

In fact, both the leaders of the Soviet Union and the presidents of the United States can be ordered chronologically based on the co-occurrences of their names in language. An experiment also showed that the bigram frequency of US president names predicted the response time of participants in their evaluation of the chronology of these presidents. These findings are explained by the Symbol Interdependency Hypothesis which predicts that as a function of language use, language encodes relations in the world around us.

Recently there have been efforts to formulate models of choices which involve both risks and time delays. An important question then is whether the concept of utility is the same for risky and inter-temporal choices. We address this question by fitting versions of two popular utility based models, Cumulative Prospect Theory for risky choice, and Hyperbolic Discounting for inter-temporal choice, to data from three experiments which involved both choice types. The models were fit assuming either the same concept of utility for both, by way of a common value function, or different utilities with separate value functions. Our results show that while many participants seem to require the flexibility of different value functions, an approximately equal number do not suggesting they may have a single concept of utility.

Here, we combine modeling and psychophysics to examine the hypothesis that RT variability may reflect ongoing statistical learning and consequent adjustment of behavioral strategy. We utilize the stop-signal task, in which subjects respond to a go stimulus on each trial, unless instructed not to by a subsequent, rare stop signal. We model across-trial learning of stop signal frequency (P(stop)) and stop-signal onset time (SSD) with a Bayesian hidden Markov model, and within-trial decision-making as optimal stochastic control. The model predicts that RT should increase with expected P(stop) and SSD, a prediction borne out by our human data. Thus, it appears that humans continuously monitor environmental statistics and adjust behavioral strategy accordingly. More broadly, our approach exemplifies the use of ""noisy"" RT measures for extracting insights about cognitive and neural processing.",>Ning Ma>Angela Yu,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0253/index.html
2015,Referential cues modulate attention and memory during cross-situational word learning,"Tracking word-object co-occurrence statistics can reduce referential uncertainty during word learning. But human learners are constrained by limits on attention and memory, and therefore must store a subset of the information available---how do they select what information to store? We hypothesize that the presence of referential cues like eye gaze guides how learners allocate their attention. In three large-scale experiments with adults, we test how the presence of referential cues affects cross-situational word learning. Referential cues shift learners away from multiple hypothesis tracking towards storing only a single hypothesis (Experiments 1 and 2). In addition, learners are sensitive to the reliability of a referential cue and when it is less reliable, they are less likely to use the cue and more likely to store multiple hypotheses (Experiment 3). Together, the data suggest a rational tradeoff: In conditions of greater uncertainty, learners tend to store a broader range of information.",>Kyle MacDonald>Daniel Yurovsky>Michael Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, U.S.>Stanford University>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0254/index.html

We investigate whether external informational sources---much like high-level knowledge obtained from previous experiences---can spare learners from having to encode all new information in fine-grained detail. If this is true, we would expect learners to encode far less detail for information that is available through known external informational resources (e.g., names of actors in a movie, the date of a historical event) than for information that is not (e.g., names of new acquaintances, the date of a wedding anniversary).

We examined two contrasting theoretical frameworks: in the first, learning proceeds by considering a fixed hypothesis of the environment's statistical structure (the set of predictive and causal relationships) and adjusting strength parameters for these relationships to optimize predictions. In contrast, the second approach directly assesses ambiguity in predictive relationships by evaluating multiple hypothesis of the environment's statistical structure. We compared these frameworks in an animal model of aversive conditioning, allowing us to also manipulate the underlying brain systems.

Additionally, a list of items describe epistemic expertise. Together, these elements make up a description of political source credibility in the USA. The current study examines the power of these elements to predict source credibility. Eliciting estimations of likelihood and importance of each item on a Likert-type scale as well as overall estimations of trustworthiness and expertise, the paper presents weighted as well as non-weighted models that predict the likelihood that election candidates are trustworthy, have expertise, and are credible sources for individual respondents. Multiple regression analyses show that non-weighted scales have slightly better predictive power than weighted scales. The findings further provide an example of a data-driven method for applying a general cognitive models of source credibility to specific domains.",>Jens Koed Madsen,">Birkbeck, University of London, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0257/index.html

Results of the analyses implied that using the 3D printed liver enhanced the construction of elaborate mental models of patients' livers, the mental simulation of liver resections, and the construction of shared mental models of patients' livers among doctors.

2015,Quit while you're ahead: Preschoolers' persistence and willingness to accept challenges are affected by social comparison,"Many beliefs about oneself are constructed through experience, but the kinds of evidence that inform these beliefs in early childhood are not well understood. One source of information that affects adults and older children’s appraisals of themselves is social comparison. We found that even preschoolers (mean=57 months) spontaneously use social comparisons to guide their behavior. In Experiment 1, children who saw they out-performed peers on a task subsequently persisted less than children in other conditions. Children who saw evidence suggesting they performed either better or worse than peers on the task were more likely to choose an easy (versus difficult) novel task relative to those who saw neutral or no evidence. In Experiment 2 children who saw peers perform better were inclined to persist more than children in other conditions. This suggests preschoolers use social comparison to draw inferences about themselves without explicit cues, and this affects their motivation.",>Rachel Magid>Laura Schulz,>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0259/index.html

We present an associative model of the acquisition of grammatical number based on the Rescorla-Wagner learning theory (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) that predicts this generalization. Number as a real-world category is inherently structured: higher numerosity sets are mentioned less frequently than lower numerosity sets, and higher numerosity sets always contain lower numerosity sets. Using simulations, we demonstrate that these facts, along with general principles of probabilistic learning, lead to the emergence of Greenberg’s Number Hierarchy.",>Robert Malouf>Farrell Ackerman>Scott Seyfarth,">San Diego State University>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0262/index.html

This “mental number-line” is known to vary cross-culturally, but there is debate about the mechanisms responsible for its cultural elaboration. We investigated the role of co-speech gesture, a ubiquitous cultural activity, in stabilizing and entrenching the mental number-line within a community. Imitating culture-specific gestures systematically shaped gesturers’ mental number-line. Moreover, gestures were used spontaneously to infer speakers’ spatial understanding of number, and merely observing these gestures was sufficient to shape the observer’s own mental number-line. These findings establish co-speech gesture as one mechanism for propagating and perpetuating the number-line.",>Tyler Marghetis>Luke Eberle>Benjamin Bergen,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0263/index.html
2015,Modeling choice and search in decisions from experience: A sequential sampling approach,"In decisions from experience (DFE), people sample from two or more lotteries prior to making a consequential choice. Although existing models can account for how sampled experiences relate to choice, they don't explain decisions about how to search (in particular, when to stop sampling information). We propose that both choice and search behavior in this context can be understood as a sequential sampling process whereby decision makers sequentially accumulate outcome information from each option to form a preference for one alternative over the other. We formalize this process in a new model, Choice from Accumulated Samples of Experience (CHASE). The model provides a good account of choice behavior and goes beyond existing models by explaining variations in sample size under different task conditions. This approach offers a process-level framework for understanding how interactions between the choice environment and properties of the decision maker give rise to decisions from experience.",>Douglas Markant>Timothy Pleskac>Adele Diederich>Thorsten Pachur>Ralph Hertwig,">Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Department of Psychology, Jacobs University Bremen>Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0264/index.html

Three new measures were developed for the assessment of spatial language processing: spatial naming, spatial verbal memory, and verbal comprehension in spatial perspective taking. Results from a sample of young adults revealed significant correlations between performance on the spatial language tasks and performance on both the analogous (non-spatial) verbal measures as well as on the (non-verbal) visual-spatial measures. Visual-spatial abilities, however, were more predictive of spatial language processing than verbal abilities. Furthermore, results from a sample of older adults revealed impairments in visual-spatial tasks and on spatial verbal memory. The results support dual process accounts of meaning, and provide further evidence of the close connection between the language of space and non-linguistic visual-spatial cognition.",>Ioanna Markostamou>Kenny Coventry>Chris Fox>Lynn McInnes,>University of East Anglia>University of East Anglia>University of East Anglia>Northumbria University of Newcastle,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0265/index.html

We provided people with a description of a novel health condition that could be treated by two different treatments, a medication and a lifestyle modification. Participants judged a medication as acting on the symptoms of a disorder instead of the cause of the disorder, while a lifestyle modification was seen as acting on both the cause and the symptoms of a health condition (Experiment 1). These results held despite participants rating both treatments as effective. Providing information about the specific causal mechanism by which a treatment could work did not increase beliefs about a medication’s ability to target the cause of a disorder (Experiment 2).

Seventy-four participants were randomly assigned to a Latino prime, American prime, or no prime condition. After being primed, subjects performed an English lexical decision task wherein they indicated whether a letter string formed an English word. Homographs, English controls, and non-words were included in the array. As predicted, there was a significant prime condition by word type interaction, F(2, 70)= 5.48, p= .006, partial eta squared = .136, suggesting that prime condition modulated reaction times to homographs. Planned contrasts showed that participants in the Latino prime condition had slower reaction times to homographs than English controls, F(1, 22)= 4.84, p= .039, partial eta squared = .180, suggesting that the Latino prime facilitated access to homographs’ Spanish meaning.",>Benjamin Marsh>Jean-Paul Snijder>Marina Pulver>Veronica Johnson>Janna Schirmer>Hyun Seo Lee>Ashley Horiuchi>Natalie Koskela>Brandon Reynoso>Raul Fajardo,">Azusa Pacific University, Azusa, California, USA>Azusa Pacific University>Azusa Pacific University>Azusa Pacific University>Azusa Pacific University>Azusa Pacific University>Azusa Pacific University>Azusa Pacific University>Azusa Pacific University>Azusa Pacific University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0268/index.html
2015,"Illusory inferences: disjunctions, indefinites, and the erotetic theory of reasoning","Work in the mental model tradition has shown that human reasoners are subject to fallacious inferences from very simple premises that have been described as tantamount to cognitive illusions. We present four experiments that show that these phenomena are much more general and systematic than has previously been thought. Among other results, we find that premises using `some' mirror premises using `or' in generating fallacious inferences, showing that there are interesting facts about reasoning with quantifiers beyond syllogisms that have been the main focus in the literature. Neither mental model theory nor other familiar theories of reasoning account for the results we present. However, the novel illusory inferences we present are predicted by the erotetic theory of reasoning (Koralus and Mascarenhas, 2013).

2015,Distributional determinants of learning argument structure constructions in first and second language,"Learning argument structure constructions is believed to depend on input properties. In particular, in a cued production task, verb production within each construction has been shown to depend on three input factors: frequency of a verb in a construction, contingency of verb–construction mapping, and verb semantic prototypicality. Earlier studies have estimated these values from a language corpus, without accounting for variation in the input to individual learners. We use a computational model to control for such variation, and our results replicate those reported for human learners. The second issue that we address relates to different ways of representing constructions: while the earlier studies employ form-only representations, we run an additional analysis for form–meaning representations. Again, the results show the impact of all three input properties on the verb production, but their relative impact depends on the representations used.",>Yevgen Matusevych>Afra Alishahi>Ad Backus,">Department of Culture Studies, Tilburg University, the Netherlands>Tilburg Center for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), Tilburg University, the Netherlands>Department of Culture Studies, Tilburg University, the Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0270/index.html
2015,Individual Differences in Chunking Ability Predict On-line Sentence Processing,"There are considerable differences in language processing skill among the normal population. A key question for cognitive science is whether these differences can be ascribed to variations in domain-general cognitive abilities, hypothesized to play a role in language, such as working memory and statistical learning. In this paper, we present experimental evidence pointing to a fundamental memory skill—chunking—as an important predictor of cross-individual variation in complex language processing. Specifically, we demonstrate that chunking ability reflects experience with language, as measured by a serial recall task involving consonant combinations from naturally occurring text. Our results reveal considerable individual differences in participants’ ability to use chunk frequency information to facilitate sequence recall. Strikingly, these differences predict variations across participants in the on-line processing of complex sentences involving relative clauses. Our study thus presents the first evidence tying the fundamental ability for chunking to sentence processing skill, providing empirical support for construction-based approaches.",>Stewart M.

Changes in fixation patterns in response to learning are well documented in studies of categorization, but the properties of the saccades that precede them and the role of visual salience in effecting eye movements remains poorly understood. This eye tracking study examines oculomotor changes in a categorization task with salient distractors. The design examines high-level, goal-directed attention that serves the purpose of learning, and making decisions based on that learned knowledge in the presence of salient distractors. We find that salient distractors draw fixation durations and saccade velocities that display similar properties to eye movements directed to task relevant items, challenging existing accounts that salience draws rapid saccades.",>Caitlyn McColeman>Mark Blair,>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0272/index.html

However, research has identified a number of exceptions to the arbitrariness assumption. In particular, non-arbitrary mappings between sound and shape, the bouba/kiki effect, have been documented across diverse languages and both children and adults are sensitive to this type of sound symbolic mapping. The cognitive basis for the associations between nonword labels and particular shapes remains poorly understood making it difficult to predict how findings generalize beyond the limited stimuli tested. To identify systematic bases for sound-to-shape mappings, we collected ratings of roundedness and pointedness for a large database of pseudowords. We find that attributes of both consonants and vowels are systematically related to judged shape meanings of pseudowords, and offer hypotheses as to the cognitive mechanisms underlying the observed patterns.",>Kelly McCormick>Jee Young Kim>Sara List>Lynne C.

In two experiments, we explored how people use the opinions of dissimilar others in making such predictions. While social cognition research has found that similar others tend to influence our judgments more than dissimilar others, the diversity principle from category-based induction argues that we value evidence from diverse sources. Our results suggest that people seek and use information from dissimilar others differently when predicting their own preferences than when making predictions with more verifiable values. For self-relevant predictions, participants were less likely to seek the opinion of dissimilar advisors (Experiment 1) and more likely to contrast their judgments away from these advisors' opinions (Experiment 2).",>Rachel Meng>Stephanie Y.

Here we develop a Bayesian framework for word learning that learns a lexicon from multiword utterances. In a set of three simulations we demonstrate this framework's functionality, consistency with experimental work, and superior performance in certain learning tasks with respect to a Bayesian word leaning model that treats word learning as inferring the meaning of each word independently of all others.

For the most part, work in language processing investigates the effects of context without investigating questions about what determines a context. For example, interpretation of any referential expression must take into account the notion of a referential domain. Here we investigate the influence of perceptual cues in establishing a referential domain, or linguistic context. We demonstrate that people use perceptual cues to establish a linguistic context; the influence of perceptual cues is gradient with respect to cue magnitude; and the contribution of a perceptual cue in constructing a linguistic context is not an effect of attention or salience.

Additionally, valence interacts with expectations of change, such that the differential impact of positive versus negative change on self-continuity is largest when positive change is expected, but is attenuated when negative change is expected.",>Sarah Molouki>Daniel Bartels,>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0282/index.html

The current study investigated this so-called choose-short effect in time and length in order to reevaluate the claim that the choose-short effect is special to temporal memory (Wearden, Parry, & Stamp, 2002). Participants made discrimination judgments in time or length on a pair of line stimuli separated by a delay. Stimulus presented during delay was varied in time or length. A length manipulation intended to be an analogue of temporal delay induced the choose-short effect in length discrimination. We developed a computational model based on ACT-R memory mechanisms (Anderson et al., 2004) to account for the main results in both time and length.

Here we investigate three factors affecting the extent to which plastic traits are fixed by selection: (i) the difficulty with which traits can be acquired through plasticity, (ii) the importance of traits to fitness, and (iii) the nature of dependencies between different traits. We find that selection preferentially fixes traits that are difficult to acquire through plasticity, traits that have larger fitness benefits, and traits that affect the acquisition of, or benefits from, other traits. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the evolution of language as well as non-human behaviors and re-consider the evolutionary significance of the Baldwin Effect.",>Thomas Morgan>Thomas Griffiths,">UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0286/index.html

We use information theory to measure the proportion of overlap between the syntactic structures of the speakers. The affective state of the speakers is indexed by aggregated measures of the affective valences of the words they use. We find that there is a positive relation between syntactic priming and affective alignment, over and above any lexical repetition effects. This constitutes evidence for the percolation of inter-speaker alignment across multiple levels of representation. This also illustrates the indexical value of syntactic alignment, as has been proposed in modern functional theories of grammar such as Dialogic Syntax.",>Fermín Moscoso del Prado Martín>John W.

Research on ITSs predominantly focuses on the impact that these systems have on overall learning, while the specific components of human-ITS interaction, such as student-PA dialogue within the system, are given little attention. One hundred undergraduate students interacted with MetaTutor, a multiagent hypermedia ITS, to learn about the human circulatory system. Data from these interactions were drawn from questionnaires and log-files to determine the extent to which a specific agent from MetaTutor, Sam the Strategizer, impacted students’ overall emotions while using the system. Results indicated that Sam negatively impacted students’ experiences of enjoyment, in relation to the other agents of MetaTutor, and the frequency of Sam’s interactions with students significantly predicted their reports of boredom while using the system.

2015,The Effect of Facial Emotion and Action Depiction on Situated Language Processing,"Two eye-tracking studies investigated the effect of emotions and actions on sentence processing. Positively valenced object-verb-subject (OVS) sentences were paired with a scene depicting three characters performing the described action (vs. no actions). These pairs were preceded by a positive prime (happy looking smiley: experiment 1; natural positive face: experiment 2). Previous research has demonstrated the effect of actions on the comprehension of OVS sentences (Knoeferle, Crocker, Scheepers, & Pickering, 2005). Moreover, emotional face primes facilitate sentence processing (Carminati & Knoeferle, 2013). We hypothesized that participants would profit from depicted events, and crucially that processing of OVS sentences might be positively affected by emotional cues. Regarding the emotion effects, we assessed how the appearance of the emotional face (smiley vs. natural) affects comprehension. Results replicate the action effects and the emotional priming effects are trending; descriptively they are more pronounced with natural faces (exp 2) than with smileys (exp 1).",>Katja Münster>Maria Nella Carminati>Pia Knoeferle,">University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, NRW, Germany>University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, NRW, Germany>University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, NRW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0291/index.html
2015,Beyond Magnitude: How Math Expertise Guides Number Representation,"Previous studies on numeric cognition have focused primarily on magnitude, based on its role as a core feature of number knowledge. In this paper, we report the results of three experiments investigating adults’ sensitivity to properties of number apart from magnitude. In Experiment 1, we use a triadic judgment task to replicate a classic study of number properties. In Experiment 2, we compare these representations among expert and non-expert groups. In Experiment 3, we examine whether instruction can tune representation of number properties. Results indicate that the triadic comparison task is a reliable method of assessing sensitivity to number properties. We found that magnitude is difficult to suppress among non-experts, who are primarily attuned to magnitude and parity. Mathematically sophisticated participants were sensitive to a range of number properties compared with the non-expert group. We discuss implications for theories of number concepts and their relation to special populations.",>April Murphy>Timothy Rogers>Edward Hubbard>Autumn Brower,">University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0292/index.html
2015,Influence of Excitation/Inhibition Imbalance on Local Processing Bias in Autism Spectrum Disorder,"People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to detect local patterns of visual stimuli more quickly than global patterns, which is opposite to the behavior of typically developing people. We hypothesized that the imbalance between excitation and inhibition neurons in the visual cortex causes the local processing bias observed in ASD. Stronger inhibitory connections could diminish the neural activities and thus prevent global feature integration, whereas properly balanced connections would enable the cortex to detect features of any size. We verified our hypothesis by employing a computational neural network called a neocognitron. Our experimental results demonstrated that the network with stronger inhibitory connections exhibited a local processing bias, whereas the network with properly adjusted connections showed a moderate global bias. Moreover, the networks with extremely strong or weak inhibitions revealed no perception bias. These results suggest that an excitation/inhibition imbalance causes multiple types of atypical perception in ASD.",>Yukie Nagai>Takakazu Moriwaki>Minoru Asada,>Osaka University>Osaka University>Osaka University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0293/index.html
2015,Mediators or Alternative Explanations: Transitivity in Human-Mediated Causal Chains,"We investigate how learning that an established type-level causal relationship is implemented by human agency affects people’s conceptualization of this relationship. In particular, we ask under what conditions subjects continue to perceive the original root cause as appropriate explanation for the resulting effect, and under what conditions they perceive the mediating intentional action as alternative explanation instead. Using a new experimental paradigm, we demonstrate that mechanisms involving intentional action lead to intuitions of causal intransitivity, but only when these actions are norm-violating.

2015,"Effect is sure, but explanation is unsure:Closer investigation of the foreign language effect with Japanese participants","The foreign language effect (Costa et al., 2014) refers to a phenomenon in which the response to a moral dilemma depends on whether it is asked in a native or second language. This study explored this effect with Japanese participants using various types of moral dilemmas. Study 1 adopted twelve variations of trolley dilemmas from Mikhail (2007). Study 2 used seven types of moral dilemmas from Greene et al. (2001). The dilemmas required permissibility and understandability judgments. Results of the two studies demonstrated the following two points. (1) Interactions between types of dilemmas (switch/footbridge) and language (native/foreign) were significant in both studies, indicating that the foreign language effects were replicated consistent with Costa et al.

(2) Evidence that contradicts the theoretical explanation of the foreign language effect was also found.",>Kuninori Nakamura,>Seijo University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0295/index.html
2015,Investigating Strategy Discovery and Coordination in a Novel Virtual Sheep Herding Game among Dyads,"Previous research investigating the dynamical processes supporting coordinated joint action has typically used non-goal-directed tasks. The present study expands on this research by investigating the coordination that emerges among pairs in a complex, goal-directed task of herding virtual sheep to the center of a field. The results revealed that the majority of pairs converged on the same stable movement coordination strategy in order to complete the task. This strategy involved pairs moving in an in-phase or anti-phase oscillatory pattern around the sheep. By adopting this strategy pairs formed an interpersonal synergy. Interestingly, the strength of this synergy was modulated by the number of sheep being herded. More specifically, more dimensional compression was observed among pairs when herding the 7-sheep compared to herding 3 or 5 sheep. The implications of these results for understanding how task difficulty and mutually defined environmental co-regulation influenced the behavioral dynamics of coordinated joint-action are discussed.",>Patrick Nalepka>Cristopher Riehm>Carl Bou Mansour>Anthony Chemero>Michael J.

Unlike other types of learning difficulties, mathematics impairments are not characterized by a single underlying cognitive deficit, instead multiple general and numeracy-specific cognitive skills have been proposed to underlie mathematics ability. Combining theory- and data-driven approaches, the study investigated cognitive mathematics profiles. Participants for this study were 97 children tracked from senior kindergarten to grade two, as part of the Count Me In Study. Using numeracy, working memory, receptive language, and phonological awareness factors, a two-step cluster analysis revealed a three-cluster solution. The groups were characterized as (1) above average overall, (2) average overall with weak visuospatial working memory, (3) poor overall with strong visuospatial working memory. Cluster 1 demonstrated strengths in mathematics and reading, compared to clusters 2 and 3.

These metaphors are often paired with gestures that reveal the possible axes along which our internal conceptualisation of time may be aligned against. The present study attempts to use such gestures as temporal primes to investigate how individuals conceptualize time. Results revealed effects of congruency along the sagittal axis, but not the lateral. This suggests that individuals primarily represent time most strongly along the sagittal axis.

However, in the current digital age, information may be gathered from both humans and technological sources that select and present information as humans do. Using methods designed to study epistemic trust in human informants (e.g., Koenig, Clement, & Harris, 2004), the current study investigates children’s and adults’ selective trust in a technological and human informant. Children (ages 4 and 5) and adults were presented with queries designed to probe their willingness to seek out and accept information from human versus technological informants. The results demonstrate that 4-year-olds prefer to seek information from a human informant, but by age 5, children show an increasing preference for the technological informant.

2015,The Symbolic Working Memory: memory accommodations for schematic processing of symbolic information,This paper describes an evolutionarily plausible description of of a specialized working memory system involved in information management for high-order cognitive tasks through its capability for controlled maintenance and schematic access to symbolic representations. Along a volatile serially accessible symbolic storage that serves a basic maintenance function the system utilizes other accessory volatile memory systems along long-term memory (LTM) and learning systems for execution of schematic access to its content. Accessory systems can help encode the episodic information including the current state of the task and more importantly provide a means for address-based access to the content of symbolic storage. LTM and learning systems help map the current state of the task onto execution programs and thus help render schematic access and process of the retained symbolic information. Implications of this feature of the model are examined for the case if concurrent-counting task.,>Nader Noori,>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0300/index.html
2015,Schematic Processing in Working Memory Tasks Relies on Learning and Long-Term Memory Resources,"This paper presents an evidence for involvement of long-term memory (LTM) resources along volatile memory (VM) resources in active management of information in a working memory (WM) task that features schematic processing of WM content. It was observed that in rehearsing frequently changing WM items in a self-paced concurrent-counting task when subjects learn and use a fixed rehearsing order across different episodes of the task they make significantly less error compared to when they adopt different rehearsing order for different episodes. This finding suggests that while retaining information in this task practically draws on volatile resources such as the phonological loop (PL), access to the corresponding item in WM relies on learning and retaining data structures in LTM. It is discussed that in this role learning and LTM resources help render schematic access to episodic information stored in less structured storage units such as PL.",>Nader Noori,>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0301/index.html
2015,The pragmatics of negation across contexts,"Why do some negative sentences sound strange, even when they are both true and grammatical? We explore the pragmatics of negation by examining adults’ explicit felicity judgments of negative sentences in context. In Experiment 1, we found that a pragmatically supportive context elicited higher felicity ratings for negative sentences, and that negative sentences expressing nonexistence were rated higher than negative sentences referring to an alternative object. In Experiment 2, we used a within-subjects design to compare three context types, and found that negative sentences were rated more felicitous in a context where most of the characters possessed the negated object, compared to contexts where the other characters possessed an alternative object or nothing. We discuss the pragmatics of negation in light of these results, arguing that the felicity of negative sentences is influenced by changes in the informativeness of these sentences in different contexts.",>Ann Nordmeyer>Michael Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0302/index.html

Three hypotheses were tested: (1) attention specifically inhibits the past, (2) attention enhances the activation of the present without affecting the past or the future, and (3) attention decreases priming of the future. In Experiment 1, using a model of sequential word production, we simulated the pattern of anticipatory and perseveratory errors on the attended words, and compared them to empirical error data. Our findings support a model in which attention only affects the present. Experiment 2 tested the prediction of this model regarding the error patterns on the word following the attended word. These results were also compatible with a transient enhancement in the activation of present that does not affect the production of the future words.",>Nazbanou Nozari>Gary Dell>Kyle Schneck>Barry Gordon,>Johns Hopkins University>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Delaware>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0303/index.html

The current analysis used Tanner and Van Hell’s response-dominance index (RDI) to examine the impact of response dominance on comprehension of garden-path sentences.

2015,Support for a Deliberative Failure Account of Base-Rate Neglect: Prompting Deliberation Increases Base-Rate Use,"People often base judgments on stereotypes, even when contradictory base-rate information is provided. It has been suggested this occurs because people fail to engage or complete deliberative reasoning needed to process numerical base-rate information, and instead rely on intuitive reasoning. However, recent research indicates people have some access to this base-rate information even when they make stereotype judgments. Here we tested several hypotheses regarding these phenomena: A) People may believe stereotype information is more diagnostic; B) people may find stereotype information more salient; C) People have some intuitive access to base-rate information, but must engage in deliberation to make full use of it. Aligning with account C, and counter to account A, we found inducing deliberation generally increased the use of base-rate information. Counter to account B, inducing deliberation about stereotypes information decreased use of stereotype information. Additionally, more numerate participants were more likely to make use of base-rate information.",>Natalie Obrecht>Dana Chesney,>William Paterson University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0305/index.html

A mind perception measure (Gray, Gray, & Wegner, 2007) was adapted for interviews with Indigenous Ngöbe adults in Panama and US college students. Participants ranked the agency capacities of various entities and provided explanations. Rankings varied systematically, with Ngöbe more likely to ascribe agency to nonhuman natural kinds than US participants. Analysis of explanations indicated that agency concepts are organized under different folktheories: US participants construed agency as a hierarchical, prototypically human capacity requiring consciousness, whereas Ngöbe construed agency as a multidimensional relational capacity expressed in directed interactions. An emphasis on psychological agency as distinct from other (biological, physical) forms of agency is widely assumed to be a conceptual prior, but these findings suggest that it may instead be a feature of Western cultural epistemologies.",>bethany ojalehto>Douglas Medin>Salino Garcia,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Ngöbe Culture and Language Education Program,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0306/index.html

There are, however, many real-world cases where crowds perform poorly. A small crowd literature has since developed, finding that better performing small crowds often exist within whole crowds. We compare previously proposed small crowd selection methods based on absolute or relative group performance to a new sequential search method and find that it selects better performing small crowds more consistently for forecasts of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation (measured by consumer price index, CPI), and unemployment rate made by US and Euro-zone surveys of professional forecasters.",>Henrik Olsson>Jane Loveday,>Santa Fe Institute>Warwick University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0307/index.html

This near-miss effect has typically been examined in situations where the agents have control over outcomes (e.g., missing a flight). Here, we extend this work in three ways. First, we show that near-miss effects play into observers’ intuitive theories of emotion even for randomly-determined outcomes over which agents demonstrably have no control. Second, we find data consistent with a hypothesis in which—even in randomly determined cases—near-miss effects reflect an illusion of control over those events. Finally, we integrate near-miss effects into a broader model of affective cognition, and quantify the psychological cost of a missing a desired outcome by relatively little distance, relative to winning or losing that outcome.",>Desmond Ong>Noah Goodman>Jamil Zaki,">Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0308/index.html

While specific patterns experience are likely to influence SL outcomes, this ability is tacitly conceptualized as a fixed construct, and few studies to date have investigated how experience may shape statistical learning. We report one experiment that directly tested whether SL can be modulated by previous experience. We used a pre-post treatment design allowing us to pinpoint what specific aspects of “previous experience” matter for SL. The results show that performance on an artificial grammar learning task at post-test depends on whether the grammar to be learned at post-test matches the underlying grammar structures learned during treatment.

It not only requires a causal understanding of the world but also the ability to distinguish whether a given event is the result of an agent's own action (intervention) or simply the consequence of the world being in action (observation). Previous studies have shown that humans can learn causal structures, and that they can distinguish interventions from observations. These studies almost exclusively focused on structures where interventions led to a simple forward conditioned inference problem. We tested human subjects in a prediction game that required the integration over hidden causes, using a betting mechanism that allowed us to monitor subjects' beliefs. Subjects learned the causal structure and the conditional probabilities with appropriate feedback. Once learned, all but one were immediately able to correctly predict the causal effects of their interventions according to optimal causal reasoning.",>Pedro A. Ortega>Daniel D. Lee>Alan A.

Tapping into the knowledge of other, similar individuals who have already experienced and evaluated some options---as harnessed by recommender system algorithms---helps people select good options for themselves. We map recommender system algorithms to models of human judgment and decision making about ""matters of fact"" and then recast the latter as social recommender strategies for ""matters of taste"". Using computer simulations on a widely-used data set from the recommender systems literature, we show that experienced individuals can benefit from relying only on the opinions of seemingly similar people. Inexperienced individuals, in contrast, are often well-advised to pick the mainstream option (i.e., that with the highest average evaluation) even if there are inter-individual differences in taste.",>Pantelis P.

We present a formal framework for modeling causal inference about sequences of point events, based on Bayesian inference over nonhomogeneous Poisson processes (ɴʜᴘᴘs).

2015,Assessing a Bayesian account of human gaze perception,"Although gaze can be directed at any location, different locations in the visual environment vary in terms of how likely they are to draw another person’s attention. One could therefore weigh incoming perceptual signals (e.g., eye cues) against this prior knowledge (the relative visual saliency of locations in the scene) in order to infer the true target of another person’s gaze. This Bayesian approach to modeling gaze perception has informed computer vision techniques, but we assess whether it is a good model for human performance. We present subjects with a “gazer” fixating his eyes on various locations on a 2-dimensional surface, and project an arbitrary photographic image onto that surface. Subjects judge where the gazer is looking in the image. A full Bayesian model, which takes image saliency information into account, fits subjects’ gaze judgments better than a reduced model that only considers the perceived direction of the gazer’s eyes.",>Peter C.

Four studies, using both hypothetical and real (incentive-compatible) choices, find that people regularly purchase more in sharing (vs. non-sharing) contexts. Evidence is presented suggesting that a significant portion of this effect is driven by a cognitive bias arising in sharing contexts that focuses people on what they will give to others, and away from what they will receive from others.

We probed participants’ recognition and source memory following a round of choices where on some trials participants were presented with the opposite face to the one they actually selected. We found no effect on recognition memory accuracy.

We propose a new method to determine whether a non-compensatory (Take-The-Best) or compensatory strategy (Logistic Regression) is more psychologically plausible: by looking at people’s active learning queries. This method goes beyond traditional model selection techniques as it reveals the information people choose to learn early on, which subsequently drives their decisions. We developed active learning algorithms for both Take-The-Best and logistic regression and designed an active learning experiment to psychologically distinguish between these two models. Letting both models and humans actively learn and then comparing their queries, we found that people follow a rank-based learning strategy in non-compensatory environments and prefer more certainty-based queries in compensatory environments.

Study participants were randomly assigned to one of two learning conditions: one in which learning was self-directed and one in which it was not. Children in the self-directed condition performed better on a recognition task, controlling for subject and item effects.

This follows from predictions of structure mapping theory (Gentner, 1983, 2003) that alignment leads to highlighting and abstraction of common relational structure. However, straightforward merging of traditional classification learning with comparison has not been effective. We explore the hypothesis that classification and comparison have an unforeseen incompatibility. In a 3x2 between-subjects design we tested three presentation conditions (unconstrained item pairs, category-matched items pairs, single items) in two supervised learning modes: classification and observation. Results demonstrate an interaction driven by highly accurate categorization for observational learners with same-category pairs. The observational mode yielded the predicted, elusive result of an advantage for within-category pairs over twice as many single-item trials. We conclude within-category comparison can be an effective means to promote relational category learning and discuss the apparent impediment of the guess-and-correct cycle.",>John Patterson>Kenneth Kurtz,">Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, United States>Binghamton University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0319/index.html

Comparing dyads with high, medium, and low levels of accuracy in communication, growth curve modeling revealed a negative relationship between success and excessive variability in levels of efficiency. Dyads performed better by maintaining moderately fluid efficiency (seen in high-success dyads) or minimizing efficiency variability (seen in medium-success dyads), rather than scrambling for efficiency only as needed (seen in low-success dyads).

Do people instinctively extend these crossmodal correspondences to vocalization? We examine the ability of congenitally deaf Chinese children and young adults (age M = 12.4 years, SD = 3.7 years) to generate iconic vocalizations to distinguish items with contrasting magnitude (e.g., big vs. small ball). Both deaf and hearing (M = 10.1 years, SD = 0.83 years) participants produced longer, louder vocalizations for greater magnitude items. However, only hearing participants used pitch—higher pitch for greater magnitude – which counters the hypothesized, innate size “frequency code”, but fits with Mandarin language and culture. Thus our results show that the translation of visible magnitude into the duration and intensity of vocalization transcends auditory experience, whereas the use of pitch appears more malleable to linguistic and cultural influence.",>Marcus Perlman>Jing Paul>Gary Lupyan,">University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA>University of Florida>University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0321/index.html

In comparison, Indo-European languages like English are assumed to be arbitrary outside of a small number of onomatopoeic words. In three experiments, we asked English speakers to rate the iconicity of words from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Developmental Inventory. We found English—contrary to common belief—exhibits iconicity that correlates with age of acquisition and differs across lexical classes. Words judged as most iconic are learned earlier, in accord with findings that iconic words are easier to learn. We also find that adjectives and verbs are more iconic than nouns, supporting the idea that iconicity provides an extra cue in learning more difficult abstract meanings. Our results provide new evidence for a relationship between iconicity and word learning and suggest iconicity may be a more pervasive property of spoken languages than previously thought.",>Lynn Perry>Marcus Perlman>Gary Lupyan,">University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0322/index.html

We explore this issue in bilinguals with a wide range of English proficiency by recording anticipatory eye-movements as participants listened to sentences (e.g., “The pirate chases the ship”) for which the object and three distractors (agent-related, action-related, unrelated) appeared in the concurrently presented images. All participants made use of combinatory information to launch anticipatory looks to the target object, but higher proficiency participants were faster than lower proficiency participants. Fixations to action-related distractors after onset of the action also varied by proficiency, with lower proficiency participants showing greater tendency to fixate this locally coherent action-related distractor. We review several possible reasons for this pattern.",>Ryan Peters>Theres Grüter>Arielle Borovsky,">Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, United States>University of Hawaii>Florida State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0323/index.html
2015,Wayfinding and restructuring in a novel city: an insight problem solving task,"Navigating in a novel environment can serve as an applied insight problem solving task, since many people gain a sudden, clear understanding (Aha-moment) of the spatial relations after being lost. With a unique design, we transformed the city center of a medieval German city into a virtual maze. The aim of the study was to test whether a spatial decision making task simulating real navigation would be feasible for investigating insight problem solving. Participants learned two pathways which they subsequently had to restructure to find their way to the navigation targets. We found evidence for the restructuring of participants’ prior knowledge during the solution attempts. 73% of all problem solvers reported an Aha-moment and there was an error drop at the critical intersection by those who had insight. The slope of the learning curve was established as a measurement of insightful experiences.",>Judit Petervari>Amory H. Danek>Virginia L.

2015,Cognitive architecture and second-order systematicity: categorical compositionality and a (co)recursion model of systematic learning,"Systematicity commonly means that having certain cognitive capacities entails having certain other cognitive capacities. Learning is a cognitive capacity central to cognitive science, but systematic learning of cognitive capacities---second-order systematicity---has received little investigation. We proposed associative learning as an instance of second-order systematicity that poses a paradox for classical theory, because this form of systematicity involves the kinds of associative constructions that were explicitly rejected by the classical explanation. In fact, both first and second-order forms of systematicity can be derived from the formal, category-theoretic concept of universal morphisms to address this problem. In this paper, we derived a model of systematic associative learning based on (co)recursion, which is another kind of universal construction. This result increases the extent to which category theory provides a foundation for cognitive architecture.",>Steven Phillips>William Wilson,">National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan>The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0325/index.html

We hypothesized that people would prefer behavior explanations that are simple and rational. We present a computational account of behavior explanation that captures these two principles. Our computational account is based on decision networks. Decision networks allow us to formally capture what it means for an explanation to be simple and rational. We tested our account by asking people to rate how satisfying several behavior explanations were (Experiment 1) or to generate their own explanations (Experiment 2).

2015,Speaker-specific generalization of pragmatic inferences based on prenominal adjectives,"To navigate many-to-many mappings between referents and linguistic expressions, listeners need to calibrate likelihood estimates for different referential expressions taking into account both the context and speaker-specific variation. Focusing on speaker variation, we present three experiments. Experiment 1 establishes that listeners generalize speaker-specific patterns of pre-nominal modification use across different adjective types. Experiment 2 examined a) the dimension of generalization (form-based or informativity-based); b) effects of the strength of the evidence (implicit or explicit); and c) individual differences in dimensions of generalization. Experiment 3 asked parallel questions for exposure to over-specified utterances; we predicted more conservative generalizations because in spontaneous utterances, speakers are more likely to over-modify than under-modify.",>Amanda Pogue>Chigusa Kurumada>Michael Tanenhaus,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0327/index.html
2015,Flexible Use of Phonological and Visual Memory in Language-mediated Visual Search,"In language-mediated visual search, memory and attentional resources must be allocated to simultaneously process verbal instructions while navigating a visual scene to locate linguistically specified targets. We investigate when and how listeners use object names in visual-search strategies across three visual world experiments, varying the presence and location of an added visual memory demand. The results suggest that as long as objects in the display can be visually inspected throughout the trial, participants do not linguistically encode those objects. We suggest that instead they use the visual environment as an external memory, mapping the spoken word onto potential referents and using perceptual visual routines automatically triggered by the spoken word. The results are discussed in terms of flexible and efficient allocation of memory resources in natural tasks that combine language and vision.",>Daniel F. Pontillo>Anne Pier Salverda>Michael K.

2015,Mathematical Model of Developmental Changes in Number Cognition,"Numerical discrimination is a primary measure of the acuity of children’s approximate number system (ANS). ANS acuity is associated with key developmental outcomes such as symbolic number skill, standardized test scores and even employment outcomes. The current study examines the factors that contribute to children’s performance on non-symbolic numerical discrimination tasks. The current study evaluates the contribution of absolute value in children’s numerical discrimination, and how that contribution may change during development. We use a combination of behavioral and computational results to illustrate a U-shaped developmental change in the factors that predict numerical discriminability. Computational modeling based on the neural coding of numerical perception demonstrates why the reported behavioral data is expected. The novel inclusion of absolute value as a predictive factor in children’s numerical discrimination suggests reevaluation of connections between numerical acuity and educational outcomes.",>Richard Prather,">University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0329/index.html
2015,Shifting Covert Attention to Spatially Indexed Locations Increases Retrieval Performance of Verbal Information,"People look at emptied spatial locations where information has been presented during encoding. There is evidence that this socalled ‘looking at nothing’ behaviour plays a functional role in memory retrieval of visuospatial and verbal information. However, it is unclear whether this effect is caused by the oculomotor movement of the eyes per se or if covertly shifting attention is sufficient to cause the observed differences in retrieval performance. In an experimental study (N = 26), participants were manipulated in being able to shift either their eyes or their focus of attention to a blank spatial location whilst retrieving verbal information that was associated with the location during a preceding encoding phase. Results indicate that it is not the oculomotor movement of the eyes that causes the facilitation while retrieving verbal materials, but rather covert shifts of attention are sufficient to promote differences in retrieval performance.",>Anja Prittmann>Agnes Scholz>Josef Krems,">Technische Universit¨at Chemnitz, Department of Psychology, Cognitive and Engineering Psychology>Technische Universit¨at Chemnitz, Department of Psychology, Cognitive and Engineering Psychology>Technische Universit¨at Chemnitz, Department of Psychology, Cognitive and Engineering Psychology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0330/index.html
2015,Attacker and Defender Counting Approach for Abstract Argumentation,"In Dung's abstract argumentation, arguments are either acceptable or unacceptable, given a chosen notion of acceptability. This gives a coarse way to compare arguments. In this paper, we propose a counting approach for a more fine-gained assessment to arguments by counting the number of their respective attackers and defenders based on argument graph and argument game. An argument is more acceptable if the proponent puts forward more number of defenders for it and the opponent puts forward less number of attackers against it. We show that our counting model has two well-behaved properties: normalization and convergence. Then, we define a counting semantics based on this model, and investigate some general properties of the semantics.",>Fuan Pu>Jian Luo>Yulai Zhang>Guiming Luo,">School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China>School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China>School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China>School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0331/index.html
2015,Learning Additive and Substitutive Features,"To adapt in an ever-changing world, people infer what basic units should be used to form concepts. Recent computational models of representation learning have successfully predicted how people discover features (Austerweil & Griffiths, 2013), however, the learned features are assumed to be additive. This assumption is not always true in the real world. Sometimes a basic unit is substitutive (Garner, 1978) - for example, a cat is either furry or hairless, but not both. Here we explore how people form representations for substitutive features, and what computational principles guide such behavior. In an experiment, we show that not only are people capable of forming substitutive feature representations, but they also infer whether a feature should be additive or substitutive depending on the input. This learning behavior is predicted by our novel extension to the Austerweil and Griffiths (2011, 2013)’s feature construction framework, but not their original model.",>Ting Qian>Joseph Austerweil,">Brown University, Providence, RI, USA>Brown University, Providence, RI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0332/index.html
2015,Why do readers answer questions wrongly after reading garden-path sentences?,"After reading “While the man hunted the deer ran into the woods”, readers often answer “yes” erroneously to the question “Did the man hunt the deer?”. Good-enough account proposes that lingering misinterpretation is caused by incomplete reanalysis. Such an account predicts more evidence of reanalysis at the disambiguating verb on trials with correct responses than those with incorrect responses. This prediction was tested using a self-paced reading and an ERP experiment. Results showed no difference in the RT and amplitude of P600 at the disambiguation between trials that were answered correctly and those that were answered incorrectly. However, results from a norming experiment showed that plausibility information significantly predicted question accuracy in both experiments, suggesting that responses to questions intended to probe whether garden-path sentences are fully reanalyzed do not always answer that question, but can instead be determined primarily by the plausibility of the events described in that question.",>Zhiying Qian>Susan Garnsey,>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0333/index.html
2015,Lateral Inhibition Overcomes Limits of Temporal Difference Learning,"There is growing support for Temporal Difference (TD) Learning as a formal account of the role of the midbrain dopamine system and the basal ganglia in learning from reinforcement. This account is challenged, however, by the fact that realistic implementations of TD Learning have been shown to fail on some fairly simple learning tasks — tasks well within the capabilities of humans and non-human animals. We hypothesize that such failures do not arise from natural learning systems because of the ubiquitous appearance of lateral inhibition in the cortex, producing sparse conjunctive internal representations that support the learning of predictions of future reward. We provide support for this conjecture through computational simulations that compare TD Learning systems with and without lateral inhibition, demonstrating the benefits of sparse conjunctive codes for reinforcement learning.",>Jacob Rafati>David Noelle,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0334/index.html

Errors in causal reasoning can be a recipe for disaster. Despite vast literature on the psychology of human causal reasoning, there are few investigations into preferred inferences in relational three-term problems. Based on a previous formal investigation about relevant causal relations we develop a cognitive modeling approach with mental models. The key principle for this approach proves to be the prediction of preferred inferences by model operations and the process of sub model integration. Subsequent experiments test preferred inferences, the number of model operations, and if concrete or generic problems make a difference in causal reasoning performance. Implications of the model are discussed.",>Marco Ragni>Stephanie Schwenke>Christine Otieno,">University of Freiburg

2015,Generating Hyperdimensional Distributed Representations from Continuous-Valued Multivariate Sensory Input,"Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) refers to the representation and manipulation of data in a very high dimensional space using random vectors. Due to the high dimensionality, vectors of the space can code large amounts of information in a distributed manner, are robust to variation, and are easily distinguished from random noise. More importantly, HDC can be used to represent compositional and hierarchical relationships and recursive operations between entities using fixed-size representations, making it intriguing from a cognitive modeling point of view. However, the majority of the existing work in this area has focused on modeling discrete categorical data. This paper presents a new method for mapping continuous-valued multivariate data into hypervectors, enabling construction of compositional representations from non-categorical data. The mapping is studied in a word classification task, showing how rich distributed representations of spoken words can be encoded using HDC-based representations.",>Okko Räsänen,">Aalto University, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Finland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0336/index.html
2015,Cross-situational cues are relevant for early word segmentation,"Existing models of infant word learning have mainly assumed that the learner is capable of segmenting words from speech before grounding them to their referential meaning, while segmentation itself has been treated relatively independently of meaning acquisition. In this paper, we argue that situated cues such as visually perceived concrete objects or actions are not just important for word-to-meaning mapping, but that they are useful in pre-linguistic word segmentation, thereby helping the learner to bootstrap the language learning process. We present a model where joint acquisition of proto-lexical segments and their meanings maximizes the referential quality of the lexicon, and where learning can occur without any a priori knowledge of the language or its linguistically relevant units. We investigate the behavior of the model using a computational implementation of statistical learning, showing successful word segmentation under varying degrees of referential uncertainty.",>Okko Räsänen>Heikki Rasilo,">Aalto University, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Finland>Aalto University, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Finland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0337/index.html
2015,"Computational evidence for effects of memory decay, familiarity preference and mutual exclusivity in cross-situational learning","Human infants learn meanings for words in interaction with their environment. Individual learning scenarios can be ambiguous due to the presence of several words and possible meanings. One possible way to overcome ambiguity is called cross-situational learning (XSL), where information is gathered over several learning trials. Experimental studies of human XSL have shown that cognitive constraints, such as attention and memory limitations, decrease human performance when compared to computer models that can store all available information. In this paper, we approach modeling of human performance with a novel computational XSL algorithm, FAMM (Familiarity preference, Associative learning, Mutual exclusivity, Memory decay), equipped with the four main components motivated by experimental research. The model is evaluated based on a number of earlier XSL experiments that probe different aspects of learning. FAMM is shown to provide a better fit to the behavioral data than the earlier proposed model of Kachergis et al. (2012).",>Heikki Rasilo>Okko Johannes Räsänen,">Aalto University, Dept.

2015,Cognitive consequences of interactivity,"When children encounter objects, design constrains and affords action and cognition. An observational study in the wild revealed how manipulable objects afforded complexity of cognitive outcomes. Evidence comes from video analysis of children’s speech, gesture, and action when using natural history exhibits. Children spoke more about the museum’s content when they touched the exhibits, but the content of their speech changed depending on the object’s affordances for interaction. With static specimens and models, children most often referred to objects’ concrete properties. With interactive exhibits, children’s speech involved references to dynamic relations among exhibit elements. Use of abstract speech and iconic gestures also suggests that they perceived interactive exhibits as representations of objects and phenomena beyond the here-and-now. When children used interactive exhibits, the content of their speech was relational, representational, and at times, both representational and relational; they employed modes of conceptualization not seen when using non-interactive exhibits.",>Nan Renner,">University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0339/index.html

These sound symbolic relationships affect word learning, but less is known about how sound symbolism affects online processing during learning or for well-learned stimuli. We use the visual world paradigm and an artificial lexicon featuring carefully controlled sound symbolic correspondences to examine the effects of sound symbolism on the online processing of novel and well-learned stimuli. Initially, participants chose novel shapes matching the sound symbolic properties of the word above chance, reliably fixating consistent shapes around word offset. As learning approached ceiling, accuracy and reaction time differences between matching and mismatching stimuli disappeared but a disadvantage in the online processing of mismatching stimuli persisted in the form of lagging target fixations. This suggests that sound symbolism affects the online processing of spoken stimuli even for well-learned words.",>Kate Pirog Revill>Laura Namy>Lynne Nygaard,>Emory University>Emory University>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0340/index.html
2015,The Attentional Learning Trap and How to Avoid It,"People often make repeated decisions from experience. In such scenarios, persistent biases of choice can develop, most notably the “hot stove effect” (Denrell & March, 2001) in which a prospect that is mistakenly believed to be negative is avoided and thus belief-correcting information is never obtained. In the existing literature, the hot stove effect is generally thought of as developing through interaction with a single, stochastic prospect. Here, we show how a similar bias can develop due to people’s tendency to selectively attend to a subset of features during categorization. We first explore the bias through model simulation, then report on an experiment in which we find evidence of a decisional bias linked to selective attention. Finally, we use these computational models to design novel interventions to “de-bias” decision-makers, some of which may have practical application.",>Alexander Rich>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0341/index.html

We use a Bayesian model to investigate the extent to which their perceptions of linguistic content incorporate their full knowledge of the phonetic category structure, or only certain aspects of this knowledge. Simulations show that listeners are best modeled as attending primarily to the most salient phonetic feature of a category when interpreting a cue, possibly attending to other features only in cases of high ambiguity.

Learners also self-reported their use of analogical comparison and self-explanation on a series of questionnaires. We evaluated condition effects on self-reports and transfer, and the relations between self-reports and transfer. Receiving materials with analogical-comparison support and reporting greater levels of analogical comparison were both associated with worse transfer performance, while reporting greater levels of self-explanation was associated with better performance. Learners’ self-reports of analogical comparison and self-explanation were not related to condition assignment, suggesting that the questionnaires did not measure the same processes promoted by the intervention, or that individual differences are robust even when learners are instructed to engage in analogical comparison or self-explanation",>J.

2015,How do different training tasks modulate our perception and hemispheric lateralization in the development of perceptual expertise?,"Holistic processing (HP) and hemispheric lateralization are both expertise markers of object recognition. For example, expertise in face and sub-ordinate object perception is shown to be associated with HP and stronger right hemispheric lateralization. However, HP is modulated by experiences of selective attention to parts such as writing experiences of Chinese characters and drawing experiences of faces. Meanwhile, hemispheric lateralization is associated with the decoding strategy employed in object recognition, such as left hemispheric lateralization for reading alphabetic scripts and right hemispheric lateralization for reading logographic scripts. This study aims at training participants to recognize the same sets of artificially-created scripts using either whole-word (Logographic) or grapheme-to-phoneme (Alphabetic) approaches. We found that both approaches induced strong HP, though the alphabetic approach induced stronger left hemisphere advantage than the logographic approach. This training study demonstrates that HP and hemispheric lateralization are separate processes that are associated with different perceptual mechanisms.",>Tso Ricky Van-yip>Au Terry Kit-fong>Hsiao Janet Hui-wen,">Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0344/index.html

The emergence of complementary actions is often an inherent aspect of robust and flexible joint-action performance. We examined the interpersonal coordination and control that emerged between two individuals performing a virtual labyrinth ball-control game. Key manipulations involved whether control was symmetrical (i.e. both individuals had full control of the board tilt) or asymmetrical (i.e. one with control of the x-axis of tilt and the other with control of the y-axis of tilt). Data on a solo individual two-handed version of the task was also collected for comparison purposes.

Almost forty years of research with adults has shown that this competition is typically won by the visual modality. Using a discrimination task on an eye tracker, the current research provides novel support for auditory dominance, with words and nonlinguistic sounds slowing down visual processing. At the same time, there was no evidence suggesting that visual input slowed down auditory processing. Several eye tracking variables correlated with behavioral responses. Of particular interest is the finding that adults’ first fixations were delayed when images were paired with auditory input, especially nonlinguistic sounds. This finding is consistent with neurophysiological findings and also consistent with a potential mechanism underlying auditory dominance effects.",>Christopher Robinson>Wesley Barnhart>Samuel Rivera,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0347/index.html
2015,"Capturing Social Motor Coordination: A comparison of the Microsoft Kinect, Video-Motion Analysis and the Polhemus Latus Motion Tracking System","Social motor coordination remains a relatively overlooked dimension of social behavior in children with ASD. One reason for the lack of research is that the motion tracking equipment historically used for recording body movements of children during social interaction has been very costly, as well as cumbersome and impractical. Here we examined whether two low-cost motion-tracking options can be employed to investigate social motor coordination in children with ASD. Of particular interest was the degree to which these low-cost methods of motion tracking could be used to capture and index the coordination dynamics that occurred between a child and an experimenter in comparison to a much more expensive, laboratory grade, motion tracking system. Overall, the results found the expensive system to be better than the low-cost methods, but that the latter two are still able to index differences in social motor coordination between typically developing and ASD children.",>Veronica Romero>Joseph Amaral>Paula Fitzpatrick>Richard Schmidt>Mike Richardson,">Center for Cognition, Action and Perception, University of Cincinnati, 4150 Edwards Cl., Cincinnati, OH 45221-0376 USA>Department of Psychology, University of Cincinnati, 4150 Edwards Cl., Cincinnati, OH 45221-0376 USA>Department of Psychology, Assumption College, 500 Salisbury St., Worcester, MA 01609-1265 USA>Department of Psychology, College of the Holy Cross, 1 College St., Worcester, MA 01609-2331 USA>Center for Cognition, Action and Perception, University of Cincinnati, 4150 Edwards Cl., Cincinnati, OH 45221-0376 USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0348/index.html

The aim of the current study was to determine whether synergistic processes constrain and organize the behavior of co-acting individuals. Participants sat next to each other and each used one arm to complete a pointer-to-target task. Using the uncontrolled manifold, the structure of joint-angle variance was examined to determine whether there was synergistic organization at the interpersonal or intrapersonal levels. The results revealed the motor actions performed were synergistically organized at both the interpersonal and intrapersonal levels.

However, these habits have rarely been tested in the situation that presumably would promote accurate reasoning – after experiencing the multivariate distribution of the variables through trial-by-trial learning, even though this is a standard paradigm.

Trying one cause for a period of time is important if the cause has tolerance, sensitization, delay, or carryover effects (TSDC). Alternating between the causes is important in autocorrelated environments – when the outcome naturally comes and goes in waves. Across two studies, participants’ beliefs about TSDC influenced the amount of alternating; however, their beliefs about autocorrelation had a very modest effect on the testing strategy. This research helps chart how well people adapt to various environments in order to optimize learning, and it suggests that in situations with no TSDC effects and high autocorrelation, people may not alternate enough.",>Benjamin Rottman,">University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0351/index.html

We find an anticipated developmental improvement in information search efficiency. We also present a formal analysis that allows us to identify the strategic component responsible for children’s inefficiency. In our 20-questions-style task, children initially ask questions and make interventions no less efficiently than adults do, but continue to search for information past the point at which they have narrowed down their hypothesis space to a single option.

2015,Restoring the Context of Interrupted Work with Desktop Thumbnails,"Knowledge work is frequently interrupted. Interruptions enable collaboration and bring timely information, but they disrupt the fragile context of ongoing activities. Computers, now ubiquitous in knowledge work, have improved in their ability to track and restore digital context (documents and files), but they do a poor job of helping users restore mental context: the ideas, intentions, and motivations behind their work. Thumbnail images are an efficient way to help computer users refind documents; we ask if they can also be used to restore mental context. We tested how three manipulations to thumbnails of personal computer screenshots impact their ability to help viewers recognize past activities and recall accurate and detailed context. In a 2-week study we found that thumbnails of portions of the screen need to be larger than thumbnails of the entire screen for successful activity recognition and that static screenshots prompted more accurate contextual recall than animations.",>Adam Rule>Aurélien Tabard>Karen Boyd>James Hollan,>UC San Diego>Université Lyon 1>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0353/index.html
2015,Representing and Learning a Large System of Number Concepts with Latent Predicate Networks,"Conventional concept learning models typically acquire one concept at a time and underemphasize how many concepts are learned as part of systems rather than as individuals. Natural number is one of the first such abstract conceptual systems children learn. Models of number learning focused on single-concept acquisition have, however, largely ignored two challenges posed by number viewed as a conceptual system: 1) there are infinitely many semantically distinct number concepts; and 2) people can reason flexibly about any number concept. To succeed, models must learn the structure of the infinite set, focusing on how relationships between numbers support reference and generalization. Here, we suggest that latent predicate networks (LPNs) – a probabilistic grammar formalism – facilitate tractable learning and reasoning for number concepts. We show how to express several key numerical relationships in our framework, and how Bayesian learning for LPNs models key phenomena observed in children learning to count.",>Joshua Rule>Eyal Dechter>Joshua Tenenbaum,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0354/index.html
2015,Helping students understand posterior probabilities: research with a digital learning environment on the Monty Hall dilemma,"When initially confronted with the Monty Hall dilemma (MHD), people show a strong tendency to stick with their initial choice, although switching maximizes winning chances. Previous research demonstrated interventions that helped participants to apply the optimal strategy, but still failed to increase participants’ understanding of the MHD solution. An exception is DiBattista’s (2011) digital learning environment study, reporting that the majority of participants who used the learning environment learned to understand the MHD solution. However, a major shortcoming was the methodology, which did not allow to infer causal relations and to conclude which manipulation was most important for participants’ understanding. The aim of the present study was to fill this research gap by conducting a controlled randomized experiment with an analogous digital learning environment. The results showed that receiving explanation about the MHD solution was the most important manipulation to improve understanding. Implications for education in (posterior) probability are discussed.",>Lore Saenen>Mieke Heyvaert>Wim Van Dooren>Patrick Onghena,">KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium>KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium>KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium>KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0355/index.html
2015,The Moral Rhetoric of Climate Change,"Communication in the media about climate change in the United States is complicated by the intensely ideologically polarized state of the debate surrounding the issue; moral rhetoric is an important dimension of how ideology is communicated. In this study we examined how moral rhetoric regarding this issue differs on the basis of a publication's perceived ideological lean. To address the question, we built a corpus from a diverse group of online news media that were rated for their perceived ideological lean. Using Latent Semantic Analysis we calculated the average loading for the five moral domains identified in Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt & Joseph, 2004) on the terms ""climate change"" and ""global warming."" We found that there were higher moral loadings overall for ""climate change"" with a greater difference seen among the more progressive media.",>Eyal Sagi>Timothy Gann>Teenie Matlock,">Northwestern University>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0356/index.html
2015,Some Probability Judgments may Rely on Complexity Assessments,"Human beings do assess probabilities. Their judgments are however sometimes at odds with probability theory. One possibility is that human cognition is imperfect or flawed in the probability domain, showing biases and errors. Another possibility, that we explore here, is that human probability judgments do not rely on a weak version of probability calculus, but rather on complexity computations. This hypothesis is worth exploring, not only because it predicts some of the probability ‘biases’, but also because it explains human judgments of uncertainty in cases where probability calculus cannot be applied. We designed such a case in which the use of complexity when judging uncertainty is almost transparent.",>Antoine Saillenfest>Jean-Louis Dessalles,">Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France>Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0357/index.html

The experimental task was to read a scenario where the performance of two groups was compared and to infer the causal effect. Whereas means were manipulated while holding standard deviations constant in the mean difference group, standard deviations were varied with holding means constant in the standard deviation difference group. The results demonstrate that participants could respond appropriately to the difference in two means, and that they gave a higher estimate of effect size in large standard deviation situations than in small standard deviation situations. Judgments about standard deviations are in contrast to Cohen’s d, indicating disproportionate attention to different kinds of data samples.",>Motoyuki Saito,>Kwansei Gakuin University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0358/index.html

The study examined how children discover the boundaries of color names by having 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children produce names for 93 color patches. We found that even 3-year-olds children can map color words to its typical referents. At the same time, they struggle to delineate the boundaries between neighboring color words. The results indicated that, in learning color words, children continuously restructure the entire semantic domain by discovering and adjusting the linguistic boundaries between the neighboring words.",>Noburo Saji>Michiko Asano>Midori Oishi>Mutsumi Imai,>Kamakura Women's University>Rikkyo University>Keio University>Keio University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0359/index.html
2015,Tactile Experience Is Evoked by Visual Image of Materials:Evidence from Onomatopoeia,"We get a lot of information from a picture based on our background knowledge. However, previous researches have paid little attention to background knowledge we use in texture processing. The present study explores the degree to which onomatopoeia evoked by visual images is affected by the multimodal experience-based knowledge such as tactile experience. In Experiment 1 participants saw original complete images and answered onomatopoeia for expressing their textures and in Experiment 2 participants saw cut out images and answered onomatopoeia for expressing their textures. We obtained 17487 onomatopoeic words from experiment 1 and 30138 onomatopoeic words from experiment 2. We counted the number of types of onomatopoeia evoked by each image. Result showed that original image evoked significantly more variety of onomatopoeia than cut-off image. This result suggests that human texture evaluations based on the original complete images are affected more easily by experience-based knowledge about the material.",>Maki Sakamoto>Tatsuki Kagitani>Ryuichi Doizaki,>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0360/index.html
2015,Highlighting the Causal Meaning of Causal Test Questions in Contexts of Norm Violations,"Experiments have shown that prescriptive norms often influence causal inferences. The reason for this effect is still not clear. One problem of the studies is that the term ‘cause’ in the test questions is ambiguous and can refer to both the causal mechanism and the agent’s accountability. Possibly subjects interpreted the causal test question as a request to assess accountability rather than causality. Scenarios that put more stress on the causal mechanism should therefore yield no norm effect. Consequently, Experiment 1 demonstrates that norms no longer influence causal judgments when the causal information is presented in a trial-by-trial learning task. Furthermore, Experiment 2 shows that norm effects are only obtained when the test question asks about a (potentially accountable) person but not when asked about a component of the causal mechanism. Both findings demonstrate that norms cease to influence causal judgments when the task settings highlight causal relations.",>Jana Samland>Michael Waldmann,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0361/index.html
2015,The influence of hand or foot responses on response times in investigating action sentence processing,"In a response time experiment dealing with action language comprehension, we investigated the question of whether the execution of a hand-response would interfere with or facilitate hand-related action sentence processing. We analyzed response times on concrete action, abstract action, and abstract control stimuli, given by hand or with the foot respectively. Beside the well-known concreteness effect, we found that responses by hand on concrete action sentences were relatively prolonged in relation to responses with the foot. Thus, there is a decisive interdependency between the effector-reference of the action verb and the effector used for response detection. We suggest that this has to be taken into account when analyzing action language comprehension and that response effectors should be chosen in accordance with the action language stimuli used.",>Franziska Schaller>Sabine Weiss>Horst M.

However, the coupling of eye gaze with an individual's head motion is often overlooked. This paper analyzes how head motion develops within a social interaction context. To measure this interaction, we developed an approach that can estimate infant head motion from ego perspective recordings as they are typically provided by eye-tracking systems. Our method is able to quantify infant head motion from existing social interaction recordings even if the head was not explicitly tracked. Therefore, data from longitudinal studies that has been collected over the years can be reanalyzed. We applied our method to an existing longitudinal study of parent infant interaction and found that infants' head motion in response to social interaction shows a developmental trend. Furthermore, our results indicate that this trend is less visible within gaze data alone.",>Lars Schillingmann>Joseph Burling>Hanako Yoshida>Yuki Nagai,>Osaka University>University of Houston>University of Houston>Osaka University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0363/index.html
2015,Large-scale investigations of variability in children's first words,"A child's first word is an important step towards language. Aggregated across children, the distribution of these first productive uses of language can act as a window into early cognitive and linguistic development. We investigate both the variability and predictability in children's first words across four new datasets. We find, first, that children's first words tend to emerge earlier than previously estimated: more than 75 percent of children produce their first word before their first birthday. Second, we find a high degree of consistency in the types of things children name in their first words, independent of the age at which they are produced. Finally, we show that the particular words that children produce first are predictable from two linguistic factors: input frequency and phonological complexity. Together, our results suggest a degree of independence between early conceptual and linguistic development.",>Rose Schneider>Dan Yurovsky>Mike Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0364/index.html
2015,Assessing the Perceived Predictability of Functions,"How do we perceive the predictability of functions? We derive a rational measure of a function’s predictability based on Gaussian process learning curves. Using this measure, we show that the smoothness of a function can be more important to predictability judgments than the variance of additive noise or the number of samples. These patterns can be captured well by the learning curve for Gaussian process regression, which in turn crucially depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of the covariance function. Using approximate bounds on the learning curve, we model participants’ predictability judgments about sampled functions and find that smoothness is indeed a better predictor for perceived predictability than both the variance and the sample size. This means that it can sometimes be preferable to learn about noisy but smooth functions instead of deterministic complex ones.",>Eric Schulz>Josh Tenenbaum>David Reshef>Maarten Speekenbrink>Samuel Gershman,">University College London>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>University College London>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0365/index.html

In a CMAB task, participants are presented with multiple options (arms) which are characterized by a number of features (context) related to the reward associated with the arms. By choosing arms repeatedly and observing the reward, participants can learn about the relation between context and reward and improve their decision strategy. We present two studies on how people behave in CMAB tasks. Within a stationary environment, we find that participants are best described by Thompson Sampling-based Gaussian Process models. In a dynamic CMAB task we again find that participants are best described by probability matching of Gaussian Process expectations. Our findings imply that behavior previously referred to as ""irrational"" can actually be seen as a well-adapted strategy based on powerful inference algorithms.",>Eric Schulz>Emmanouil Konstantinidis>Maarten Speekenbrink,">University College London, London, London, United Kingdom>Carnegie Mellon University>University College London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0366/index.html

The motion of swarms, then, is complex, with the influence if independent members within a coherent structure of the group. We investigated whether human perception of biological swarms was sensitive to this internal complexity of the group motion, as has been observed for biological motion of single objects, such as the limbs of a walking person. In two experiments, we tested motion detection and discrimination of biological swarm motion compared with scrambled, unstructured spiral and rigidly-structured rotational motion. The results showed that discrimination of swarms was superior to perception of scrambled swarms that contained no structure, but was worse than discrimination of the motion of rigid structures. These results suggest that perception of swarms doesn't engage a specialized mechanism for detecting internal structure, as is found with other types of biological motion.",>Adriane Seiffert>Sean Hayes>Caroline Harriott>Julie Adams,>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0367/index.html
2015,"Task-set inhibition, conflict, and the n-2 repetition cost: A computational model of task switching","In task switching, the n-2 repetition cost (informally, the elevation in RT associated with performing a recently abandoned task) is an indicator of residual task-set inhibition. One suggestion is that such inhibition is triggered by conflict between task-set elements. We present a novel computational model instantiating this proposal, by adding task-conflict monitoring units to an existing, interactive activation model of task switching. The model produces the empirical pattern, n-1 switch costs and n-2 repetition costs, as an intrinsic property of its architecture, but dependent on the inhibition of task demand units by the conflict detection mechanism. In a further simulation, we make predictions about n-2 repetition costs for asymmetric tasks, and show that one functional benefit of such a conflict-based, task inhibition mechanism is to facilitate top-down control of tasks by automatically reducing cross-task interference.",>Nicholas Sexton>Richard Cooper,">Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0368/index.html

As such, foraging strategies and mechanisms offer useful insight into abstract forms of search such as visual search, problem solving, and semantic recall. We performed a series of foraging simulations using artificial neural networks to relate metastable neuronal dynamics to observed foraging behaviors. We show that the velocity and tortuosity of the foraging paths are influenced by metastable neuronal activity, while resource collection is unaffected.

2015,Examining the role of Inhibitory control in bilingual language switching,"Bilingual language production is widely believed to be a competitive process. Bilinguals may manage this competition by relying on inhibiting one language while speaking in the other. However, it remains unclear if this process relies on domain general inhibitory mechanisms, and, if so, when and where during language production inhibitory control is applied. The current study investigates these issues by experimentally manipulating demand on inhibitory control using a picture word interference task during a language switching paradigm. Switching costs were not exacerbated when inhibitory control was taxed; in fact language switching was less costly during inhibition-demanding trials. These findings do not support the idea that inhibitory control mechanisms underlie language switching and suggest that language switching and the resolution of within-language lexical competition do not share inhibitory resources.",>Alison Shell>Jared Linck>L.

We conducted a fieldwork study to observe the practice of expert dancers under natural conditions, and analyzed data for the progress of a dancer’s proficiency at a particular skill. Results indicated that the practice process involved not only refining the quality of the skill, but also two other activities: the exploration of new and original skills utilizing the characteristics of that skill, and choreographing that skill so that it could fit into his full performance.

Here we explore how the dynamics of spoken word recognition differ for second language listeners. Groups of native Korean speakers and native English speakers listened to recordings of words in three conditions: phonological overlap at the beginnings of words (cohort), at the ends of words (rhyme), or without phonological overlap (unrelated), and used a computer mouse to select the matching stimulus from an array of two pictures. The results did not reveal any interactions between language background and performance. Nor were effects of similarity related to overall performance on independent tests of speech sound categorization or vocabulary.

The present paper explored if the variation can be explained by the differentiation of the perceived outcome probabilities. We generated moral dilemmas that were similar to the classical trolley and footbridge dilemmas, and investigated the extent to which subjects were sensitive to the outcome probabilities. Results indicated that the majority of subjects, including both those who initially chose a deontological decision and those who initially chose a consequentialist decision could be sensitive to outcome probabilities. The likelihood of being sensitive to the probabilities was invariant across different dilemmas. The variation of the choice behaviors across different dilemmas might be associated with the variation of the estimated outcome probabilities.",>Yiyun Shou>Fei Song,>The Australian National University>The University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0375/index.html

Many models focus on structural features of online social networks as predictors of meme success. The current work takes a different approach, predicting meme success from linguistic features. We propose predictive power is gained by grounding memes in theories of working memory, emotion, memory, and psycholinguistics. The linguistic content of several memes were analyzed with linguistic analysis tools. These features were then trained with a multilayer supervised backpropagation network. A set of new memes was used to test the generalization of the network. Results indicated the network was able to generalize the linguistic features in order to predict success at greater than chance levels (80% accuracy). Linguistic features appear to be enough to predict meme transmission success without any information about social network structure.",>Keith Shubeck>Stephanie Huette,">University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA>University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0376/index.html

Although often used as a research tool (Mayer, 2014), the strategies and methods used by Tetris players have seldom been an explicit focus. In Study 1, we use cross-entropy reinforcement learning (Thiery & Scherrer, 2009) to explore (a) the utility of high-level strategies for maximizing performance and (b) a variety of features and feature-weights (methods) for optimizing a low-level, one-zoid optimization strategy. Two strategies quickly rise to performance plateaus, whereas two others continued towards higher but more variable performance. In Study 2, we compare zoid (i.e., Tetris piece) placements made by our best models with those made by the full spectrum of novice-to-expert human Tetris players.

These behaviors are true of adults, but even more so for young children. Recent studies have demonstrated that adults learn better under conditions of selection learning, where they can make decisions about the information they wish to acquire, as compared to reception learning, where they merely observe data that happens to be available to them. Yet to date, it remains unclear whether this advantage is available to children, and if so, does it arise because children can gather data in a non-random way? In the current study, we show that 7-year-old children show superior learning under conditions of selection in a category-learning task, and that their information gathering is systematically driven by uncertainty.",>Zi L.

These findings stand in contrast with earlier findings that 36-month-old children can learn effectively from data they generate by themselves under conditions of complete free play.

However, although short-term verbal memory is generally considered to be a crucial component of language processing, the relevant information chunk level that may define capacity limits in ecologically-valid spoken language has never been investigated. The Intonation Unit (IU), an intermediate-level prosodic phrase, has been theorized to be a fundamental unit of spoken language, the focus of a speaker's mental processing. This suggests that IUs might play a role as the relevant unit representing ""chunks"" of spoken language. We report the results of an experiment investigating the role of IUs in short-term memory in a serial recall task. We found a significant non-linear effect of stimulus size in IUs, but not clauses.

Controversially, (Daltrozzo & Conway, 2014) SL is thought to occur without attention or pattern consciousness (PC, or explicit knowledge) and thus is often deemed as implicit. We examined the role of selective attention and PC in visual SL using event-related potentials (ERP) with healthy adults. We measured selective attention in thirty-four participants (27 females, 18-49 years) with a Flanker task, followed by a SL task (while recording ERPs) and a questionnaire to measure PC. The SL task prompted participants to indicate target occurrence within a sequence of on-screen stimuli. Participants were unaware of two-predictor items in the sequence or that they predicted target occurrence with high/low probability. Results indicated that higher attention was related to left-lateralization of SL ERP effects under low PC and more rostral left-lateralized effects under higher PC. These neural findings suggest that attention and PC modulate SL.",>Sonia Singh>Jerome Daltrozzo>Chistopher Conway,">Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0381/index.html

In a series of three experiments, we investigated how adults’ performance on a visual sequence-learning task aligned with the predictions of these two types of models. Experiments 1 and 2 examined learning of embedded items and Experiment 3 examined learning of illusory items.

Specifically, given the expression the enemy's destruction, how do the speakers decide whether the possessive argument is the entity that initiates the action (agent) or the entity that is causally affected by the event (patient)? The results of an experimental study show that this choice is dependent on the lexical semantics of the nominal. The theoretical implication is that that deverbal nominals are similar to verbs in that they have argument structure. By studying comprehension of deverbal nominals, the current study extends the scope of previous experimental work on lexical semantics that has been primarily concerned with verbs.",>Anastasia Smirnova,">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0383/index.html
2015,Prospective uncertainty: The range of possible futures in physical prediction,"Recent research has suggested that people make physical predictions based on extrapolation from a noisy representation of the world, which gives rise to a probabilistic distribution over possible future worlds. But can people use the uncertainty of their predictions to inform their decisions, or can people access only a single possible future? Here we demonstrate that confidence-sensitive decisions about the future track the amount of uncertainty expected from probabilistic forward extrapolations. Participants were asked to make predictions about where a ball would go and indicate an expected range around that prediction. This range was well correlated with two measures of uncertainty: variability in predictions across participants and the amount of uncertainty expected by a model of physical prediction. This suggests that people form a probabilistic distribution over possible futures in the course of physical prediction and base their decisions about the future on this range.",>Kevin Smith>Edward Vul,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0384/index.html
2015,Let's Get Physical: Thinking with Things in Architectural Design,"To study the cognitive role that tangible objects play in design thinking, we gave 17 architects and novice students a set of blocks and asked them to design their dream house. Although the blocks seem simple they are filled with perceptual surprises. We regard manipulating blocks as a form of physical thinking because through interaction designers increase the dimensionality of their design space. This happens because a) perceptual ambiguity leads to multiple semantics - multiple ways of identifying what shapes are out there, and b) kinesthetic and other forms of non-visual interaction enables designers to feel inertia, mass, force and gravity and thereby encounter blocks and their relations in additional ways. The effects of tangibility and enactive forms of perception is that the design space expands, often leading architects to more divergent thinking.

2015,Reading and writing direction effects on the aesthetic perception of photographs,"Does the habitual reading and writing direction (RWD) affect the aesthetic appreciation of visual art? Pérez González (2012) showed that 19th century Iranian and Spanish professional photographers manifest lateral biases linked to RWD in their compositions. The present study aimed to test whether the general public shows similar biases. Photographies with left-to-right (L-R) and right-to-left (R-L) directionality were selected and presented in both the original and mirror reversed forms to Spanish and Moroccan participants. In Experiment 1, participants rated each picture as to how aesthetically pleasing it was. The results showed no interactions with RWD. In Experiment 2, we presented each picture and its mirror version and asked the participants to choose which one they liked better. Now, clear biases linked to RWD arose. RWD does affect aesthetic impressions of photography in the general public, but only when people are paying attention to the lateral spatial dimension of the pictures.",>Chahboun Sobh>Flumini Andrea>Carmen Pérez González>I.

In most cases, this distinction is done in a monolingual scenario. In this work, we discuss a set of features that distinguish between genders in six different datasets of blog data in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian and Catalan with accuracies that range from 77% to 88%. Using a reduced set of language-independent structural features in a multilingual scenario we first identify the gender and then the gender and language of the author, achieving accuracies higher than 74%.",>Juan Soler-Company>Leo Wanner,">Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain>Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0387/index.html
2015,Elemental Causal Learning from Transitions,"Much research on elemental causal learning has focused on how causal strength is learned from the states of variables. In longitudinal contexts, the way a cause and effect change over time can be informative of the underlying causal relationship. We propose a framework for inferring the causal strength from different observed transitions, and compare the predictions to existing models of causal induction. Subjects observe a cause and effect over time, updating their judgments of causal strength after observing different transitions. The results show that some transitions have an effect on causal strength judgments over and above states.",>Kevin Soo>Benjamin Rottman,">University of Pittsburgh

2015,"Exploring the processing costs of the ""exactly"" and ""at least"" readings of bare numerals with event-related brain potentials","Bare numerals (e.g. ""two"") seem to be ambiguous between two readings: the ""exactly"" and the ""at least"" reading. We present an ERP study that explores this issue. We show that the pattern of the ERPs elicited by critical nouns in sentences with unembedded bare numerals depends on the participant’s choice of the reading of the numeral. For those responders who consistently apply the ""exactly"" reading in their truth-value judgement, sentences that are true only under the ""at least"" reading are associated with a sustained negativity effect compared to sentences that are true also under the ""exactly"" reading. However, no such effect is evident for the responders who apply the ""at least"" interpretation. We argue that this result falsifies the ""exactly-theory"" of numerals and speaks in favor of the ambiguity account.

This model follows the intuition of allocated resources modulating spatial resolution, but it implements it in a specific way that leads to accurate predictions in multiple task manipulations. Experiments on human subjects, guided by the model's predictions, demonstrate that observers tracking multiple objects use low-level computations of target confusability to adjust the spatial resolution at which the target needs to be tracked, and that the resulting allocation closely approximates the rational solution. Whereas earlier models of multiple object tracking have predicted the big picture relationship between stimulus complexity and response accuracy, our approach makes accurate predictions of both the aggregate effect of target number and velocity and of the variations in difficulty across individual trials and targets arising from the idiosyncratic within-trial interactions of targets and distractors.",>Nisheeth Srivastava>Ed Vul,">University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>UCSD Psychology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0390/index.html
2015,Choosing fast and slow: explaining differences between hedonic and utilitarian choices,"This paper examines the psychological differences between hedonic and utilitarian patterns of preference behavior. Instead of using latent variables like self-control and emotion to explain these differences, we show that they emerge as natural consequences of solving two different but related problems within an inductive framework of preference learning. We show that hedonic decisions involve tracking the variability of a binary variable, whereas utilitarian decisions require the maintenance of a distribution over a vector of object labels. Computational experiments show that this difference in cognitive representation ensures that hedonic decisions have a lower cognitive sampling cost, which makes them less effortful. Further experiments reveal differences in error rates as a function of deliberative effort between the two paradigms. Deliberative effort benefits utilitarian choices, but not hedonic ones. Overall, our work demonstrates the critical role of cognitive representations in extracting strikingly different behavior patterns from simple models of information processing.",>Nisheeth Srivastava>Ed Vul,">University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>UCSD Psychology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0391/index.html
2015,Watch out! - An instruction raising students’ epistemic vigilance augments their sourcing activities,"Most students profit from the easy access to online information, but specific competences for successful reading on the internet are seldom taught during class. Therefore, students might not be able to choose credible information autonomously. Empirical evidence suggests that high school students hardly evaluate the credibility of sources (“sourcing”) when reading from multiple documents. Consequently, effective interventions fostering sourcing skills are needed. This study evaluates the effect of a written instruction designed to augment sourcing activities in a multiple document reading task by inducing epistemic vigilance. The written instruction introduces the concept of the division of cognitive labor and informs about low editorial control on the internet. In comparison to a control group, students receiving the instruction prior to completing an internet research task showed more attention to, evaluation of, and memory for sources.",>Marc Stadtler>Johanna Maria Paul>Silke Globoschütz>Rainer Bromme,>University of Muenster>University of Muenster>University of Duesseldorf>University of Muenster,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0392/index.html

Yet they can accelerate their learning by using functional knowledge about the features characterizing the alternatives. We designed a novel contextual multi-armed bandit task where decision makers chose repeatedly between multiple alternatives characterized by two informative features. We compared human behavior in the contextual task with a classical multi-armed bandit where decision makers did not have access to feature information. Behavioral analysis showed that participants in the contextual bandit used features to direct their exploration for promising alternatives. Ex post, we tested the participants functional knowledge in one shot multi-feature choice trilemmas.

2015,Toddlers Always Get the Last Word: Recency biases in early verbal behavior,"A popular conception about language development is that comprehension precedes production. Although true during the earliest stages of phonological development, once a child possesses the basic articulatory skills required for imitation, it need not necessarily be the case. A child could produce a word without possessing the fully formed lexical representation through imitation. In some cases, such as in response to questions containing fixed choices, this behavior could be mistaken for a deeper understanding of the words' semantic content. In this paper, we present evidence that 2- to 3-year-old children exhibit a robust recency bias when verbally responding to two-alternative choice questions (i.e., they select the second, most recently mentioned option), possibly due to the availability of the second word in phonological memory. We find further evidence of this effect outside of a laboratory setting in naturalistic conversational contexts in CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000), a large corpus of transcribed child-adult interactions.",>Emily Sumner>Erika Deangelis>Mara Hyatt>Noah Goodman>Celeste Kidd,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>Stanford University>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0395/index.html

Here we present a unique method to derive the generating functions for the waiting time of sequential patterns, then compare these functions with the neural mechanisms for learning sequential structures. We show that the way the neocortex integrates information over time bears a striking resemblance to the way these normative functions operate. They both operate by organizing combinatorial objects into meaningful groups then compressing the representations by discarding irrelevant information. As a result, discrete-time signals are converted into frequency signals, and similarity-based structures are converted into abstract relational structures. Our analyses not only reveal surprisingly rich statistical structures embedded in the seemingly random sequences, but also offer an explanation for how higher-order cognitive biases may have emerged as a consequence of temporal integration.",>Yanlong Sun>Hongbin Wang,">Texas A&M; University Health Science Center, Houston, Texas, USA>Texas A&M; University Health Science Center, Houston, Texas, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0396/index.html

In an experimental study (N = 42 undergraduate and graduate students), we tracked eye movements of the participants while they took a critical thinking test and received their test results. The results showed that most participants checked feedback for incorrectly-answered questions but not for correctly-answered questions. This suggests that learners do not use feedback information to judge the adequacy of the process of solving. In addition, these tendencies were not different between feedback conditions. Furthermore, participants’ achievement goals predicted learners’ review activities. Specifically, learners with higher mastery goals tended to check feedback for correctly-answered questions. Therefore, fostering the pursuit of mastery goals may prompt learners to use feedback information to enhance their comprehension.",>Masayuki Suzuki>Tetsuya Toyota>Yuan Sun,>Showa Women's University>Aoyama Gakuin University>National Institute of Informatics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0397/index.html

In a two-by-two factorial design, 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade elementary students at an afterschool program in Harlem, NYC (NTTL=72; x̄AGE=10.31 years [1.64], 67% female) were randomly assigned to play one of the four tutor-game environments (SC, SD, WC, WD). Pre/post scores on formal fractions assessments showed significant learning for all groups. Tutor-log data revealed that students using conceptual gestures were significantly more accurate at estimating and denominating fractions than students using deictic gestures. Observational notes, student exit surveys and clinical interviews corroborated that many students used the tutors’ gestures in their explanations of fractions.

This approach has been quite successful in terms of applying the principles of spatial search to cognitive search, but here we add additional justification by grounding cognitive search in spatial measures. We asked subjects to perform a semantic fluency task, recalling items from the category of cities in California, so we could use physical, geographic coordinates to characterize cognitive search.

The goal of this study is to describe the process of art concept formation by a contemporary artist through quantitative analyses of a text corpus based on interviews with the artist. From an analysis of the frequency of occurrence of items of vocabulary in the interview data and the TF-IDF, we find that the second of three phases in the artist's creative process was the most critical for the formation of the art concept, as also shown in our previous qualitative study. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the contents of the art concept, White Noise, were continuously modified and developed over time. Further, based on an analysis of co-occurrence frequencies of words, the structure of the art concept is deduced from the importance of co-occurring vocabulary.",>Kikuko Takagi>Akihiro Kawase>Sawako Yokochi>Takeshi Okada,">Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies, The University of Tokyo>Center for Corpus Development, National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics>Department of Child Psychology, Tokyo Future University>Graduate School of Education, Interfaculty Initiative in Information Studies, The University of Tokyo",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0401/index.html

We hypothesized that passive presentation of category exemplars might act synergistically with active adaptive learning to further enhance PL. Passive presentation and active adaptive methods were applied to PL and transfer in a complex real-world domain. Undergraduates learned to interpret real electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings by either: (1) making active classifications and receiving feedback, (2) studying passive presentations of correct classifications, or (3) learning with a combination of initial passive presentations followed by active classification. All conditions showed strong transfer to novel ECGs at posttest and after a one-week delay. Most notably, the combined passive-active condition proved the most effective, efficient, and enjoyable. These results help illuminate the processes by which PL advances and have direct implications for perceptual and adaptive learning technology.",>Khanh-Phuong Thai>Sally Krasne>Philip Kellman,>University of California Los Angeles>University of California Los Angeles>University of California Los Angeles,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0404/index.html

Games included a word-stem completion task (orthographic), a free association task (semantic), and a crossword paradigm task (orthographic+semantic). A within-subject experiment was used to compare the relative effectiveness of these three training methods on a lexical association task performed prior to and following training. Results showed that the games were able to improve participants’ decision times, and the increased fluency in the lexical association task due to the free association task was greater than the other games.

Both metaphors capture something about wealth disparities, but only failing organ seems to emphasize the fact that our economy is a complex system where activity in one region may lead to a cascade of problems in other parts of the system. In the present study, we introduce a novel method for classifying such “systemic” metaphors, which reveals that people can reliably identify the extent to which a metaphor highlights the complex causal structure of a target domain. In a second experiment, we asked whether exposing people to more systemic metaphors would induce a systems thinking mindset and influence reasoning on a seemingly unrelated task.

One challenge facing researchers, however, is that it can be difficult to make principled predictions about exactly how metaphors will influence thought. Here, we use an explicit comparison task to quantify the persuasive capacity of metaphors. In Experiment 1, people were given two metaphors and two policy responses. They were asked to match one policy to each metaphor. In Experiment 2, people read metaphorically framed issues and chose between policy responses. We found that data from the explicit comparison task predicted behavior from another group of participants on the metaphor framing task; a measure of linguistic association from LSA did not predict behavior on the framing task. These results suggest a relationship between explicit analogical comparison and more implicit natural language metaphor processing.

For instance, Thibodeau & Boroditsky (2011, 2013) found that people were more likely to want to fight back against a crime beast by increasing the police force but more likely to want to diagnose and treat a crime virus through social reform. Here, we report two norming studies and two experiments that reveal a shift in the overall landscape of opinion on the topic of crime. Importantly, we find that the metaphors continue to have an influence on people’s reasoning about crime.

Participants remembered the difference in heaviness of rods but only when haptic information was solely available during the earlier perception of overhead reaching height and vision was occluded.

Prior research has shown that people’s willingness to wait for a future reward decreases with increases in time. At the same time, this research has also shown that such effects can depend on the vividness of the future reward, as well as on individual differences. The present research offers a potential explanation for these effects in demonstrating how representations of the future can depend not only on objective distances in time, but also on how distances in time are construed. In three experiments using a delay discounting paradigm, we show that participants who represent the future as close to the present are more likely to wait for future rewards than those who represent the future as far, even when the objective distances are held constant.

2015,Building the mental timeline: Spatial representations of time in preschoolers,"When reasoning about sequences of events, English-speaking adults often invoke a “mental timeline,” stretching from left (past) to right (future). Although the direction of the timeline varies across cultures, linear representations of time are argued to be ubiquitous and primitive. On this hypothesis, we might predict that children should spontaneously invoke a timeline when reasoning about time. However, little is known about how the mental timeline develops. Here, we use a sticker placement task to test whether 3- to 6-year-olds spontaneously produce linear, spatial representations of time. We find that, while English-speaking children under age five rarely adopt such representations without prompting, a spatial prime increases the percentage of 4-year-olds producing linear, ordered, and left-to-right representations of time by a factor of three. Our findings suggest that, while preschoolers do not spontaneously use a mental timeline, they can readily form mappings between time and space to represent temporal sequences.",>Katharine Tillman>Nestor Tulagan>David Barner,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0412/index.html
2015,How Sharp is Occam’s Razor? Language Statistics in Cognitive Processing,"According to the dominant view in cognitive science, language processing requires perceptual simulation of symbols. Various experiments have shown that words that share a perceptual relation are processed faster. We have proposed an alternative view where perceptual cues are encoded in language. However, experiments supporting perceptual simulation or language statistics have focused on concept words. It remains therefore unclear whether the evidence found for language statistics might actually just be evidence for perceptual simulations. We presented subjects with lexical items as well as stimuli unlikely to be represented in the perceptual world: grammatical items. Results showed that response times to lexical items could be explained by both a statistical linguistic approach and a perceptual simulation approach, supporting both perceptual and language statistics accounts. Results for the responses to grammatical items were explained by statistical linguistic information but not by a perceptual simulation account, raising questions about the principle of parsimony.",>Richard Tillman>Sterling Hutchinson>Max Louwerse,">Tilburg University, The Netherlands>Tilburg University, The Netherlands>Tilburg University, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0413/index.html

We tested for a similar effect within third party dialogue comprehension, in which overheard addressees displayed evaluative backchannel responses. Participants observed an interaction containing valence- ambiguous personal information, and were later asked to recall the information and make related judgments. Addressees either responded positively or negatively to the speaker’s description. Across three experiments, we found that addressee responses biased recall when the responses were cues to a shared perspective, either due to the collaborative construction of the talk or prior shared knowledge between speaker and addressee. Addressee responses as cues to the addressee’s stance alone did not bias overhearer recall. These findings support the argument that perception of a shared reality is a central component of dialogue comprehension.",>Jackson Tolins>Jean E Fox Tree,">University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California, United States>University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0414/index.html

Also, subjective weighting was considered and choice options were constructed following individual preferences, hence avoiding choices biased by differences in preferences. The main effect was replicated with a big sample (N=120, CT: 50.8%, UT: 70.5% chose the best alternative), using four different dependent measures.

In infancy, lower SES is associated with delays in real-time language processing skills, but it is not known whether or how this relationship carries into adulthood. We explore these questions by assessing the timecourse of anticipatory sentence interpretation in a visual-world eye-tracking task in college-aged adults from higher and lower SES backgrounds. While there were only subtle SES-related timing differences in anticipation of a sentence-final target noun, we found SES-related differences in looks to competitor items on the screen. Particularly, individuals from higher SES backgrounds showed relatively more looks to action-related competitors just prior to onset of the target noun. These findings suggest that early SES influences the dynamics of lexical activation during sentence processing even in adulthood and highlight the importance of early lexical input and experience for adult language skill.",>Melissa Troyer>Arielle Borovsky,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0417/index.html
2015,Hypothesis-Space Constraints in Causal Learning,"How do children identify promising hypotheses worth testing? Many studies have shown that preschoolers can use patterns of covariation together with prior knowledge to learn causal rela- tionships. However, covariation data are not always available and myriad hypotheses may be commensurate with substantive knowledge about content domains. We propose that children can identify high-level abstract features common to effects and their candidate causes and use these to guide their search. We investigate children’s sensitivity to two such high-level features — proportion and dynamics, and show that preschoolers can use these to link effects and candidate causes, even in the absence of other disambiguating information.",>Pedro Tsividis>Josh Tenenbaum>Laura Schulz,>MIT>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0418/index.html
2015,Social Eye Cue: How Knowledge Of Another Person’s Attention Changes Your Own,"We are highly tuned to each other’s visual attention. Eye or hand movements of another person can influence the timing of a saccade or a reach of our own. However, it's not clear whether the effect of social cues is due to the appearance of the cue – an eye or hand - or the belief that the cues are connected to another person. In two experiments we investigated this question using a spatial cueing paradigm and measuring the inhibition of return of visual attention. When participants believed that a cue stimulus – a red dot – reflected the attentional focus of another person via an eye tracker, they responded differently to when they believed its location was determined by a computer. Despite previous claims that they are ‘blind’ to such factors, when a cue was imbued with a social context it exerted a stronger influence over low-level visual attention.",>Miles Tufft>Matthias Gobel>Daniel Richardson,>UCL>UCL>UCL,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0419/index.html
2015,Constructing meaning: Material products of a creative activity engage the social brain,"Symbolic artifacts present a challenge to theories of neurocognitive processing due to their dual nature: they are both physical objects and vehicles of social meanings. While their physical properties can be read of the surface structure, the meaning of symbolic artifacts depends on their embeddedness in cultural practices. In this study, participants built models of LEGO bricks to illustrate their understanding of abstract concepts. Subsequently, they were scanned with fMRI while presented to photographs of their own and others’ models. When participants attended to the meaning of the models, we observed activations associated with social cognition and semantics. In contrast, when attending to the physical properties, we observed activations related to object recognition and manipulation. Furthermore, when contrasting own and others’ models, we found activations in areas associated with autobiographical memory and agency. Our findings support a view of symbolic artifacts as neuro-cognitive trails of human social interactions.",>Kristian Tylén>Johanne Stege Bjørndahl>Andreas Roepstorff>Riccardo Fusaroli,>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Aarhus University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0420/index.html

Traditional lab studies have found support for a better memory for minimally counterintuitive concepts. This paper presents an in-depth case study of the spread of a counterintuitive religious idea in the real world. It finds that counterintuitiveness alone is not sufficient to guarantee persistence of a religious belief.

Real-world interactivity was domesticated in a laboratory environment. Participants worked on an insight problem, the so-called 17 Animals problem: the solution involves the spatial arrangements of sets but masquerades as an arithmetic problem. Problem solving took place in two different ecosystems: in one, participants were given a stylus and an electronic tablet to sketch out a model of the solution; in a second, participants could interact with artifacts to build a model of the solution. Participants in the sketch group were never able to break the impasse, whereas model building participants were more likely to propose a correct solution. Video evidence revealed substantial differences in the manner with which participants ‘thought’ about the problem as a function of the type of interactivity.

2015,Predicting Lexical Norms Using a Word Association Corpus,"Obtaining norm scores for subjective properties of words can be quite cumbersome as it requires a considerable investment proportional to the size of the word set. We present a method to predict norm scores for large word sets from a word association corpus. We use similarities between word pairs, derived from this corpus, to construct a semantic space. Starting from norms for a subset of the words, we retrieve the direction in the space that optimally reflects the norm data associated with the words. This direction is used to orthogonally project all the other words in the semantic space on, providing predictions of the words on the variable of interest. In this study, we predict valence, arousal, dominance, age of acquisition, and concreteness and show that the predictions correlate strongly with the judgments of human raters. Furthermore, we show that our predictions are superior to those derived using other methods.",>Hendrik Vankrunkelsven>Steven Verheyen>Simon De Deyne>Gert Storms,>University of Leuven>University of Leuven>University of Leuven>University of Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0423/index.html

Reference to mechanisms is common in the NCC research. Furthermore, recent developments in non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS) lend support to a manipulationist standpoint. The crucial question is to understand what is changed after manipulation of a brain mechanism. In the second part of the paper I review the literature on intentionalism, and argue that intervention on the neural mechanism is likely to change the intentional content of consciousness. This urges us to shift from content-NCC to what I call “intentional mechanisms”.

Often our goals involve the integration of another’s goals, such as lifting heavy objects together. The purpose of this study was to investigate how another’s actions might influence one’s own goal-oriented perceptions, specifically, verbal distance estimates. Using a within-subject paradigm, we replicated a well-known finding that carrying a weighted backpack results in larger distance estimates relative to not carrying a backpack. In a crucial second condition, this effect was reversed: distance estimates were significantly greater when not carrying a weighted backpack than when carrying a backpack. In this condition, participants provided distance estimates while wearing a weighted backpack during the first phase and then gave estimates while not wearing a backpack, but following an experimenter wearing a weighted backpack in the second phase. Three additional conditions systematically documented how the observations of another’s actions influenced distance estimates.",>David Vinson>Jerome Scott Jordan>Alycia Hund,">University of California, Merced, Merced, California, United States>Illinois State University>Illinois State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0428/index.html

When this model is combined with a measure of accessibility in discourse and a processing time limit imposed by the speed of natural language production, the model accounts for novel empirical data of the interpretation of null as well as overt subject pronouns in Italian.

2015,Pattern Probabilities for Non-Dichotomous Events: A New Rational Contribution to the Conjunction Fallacy Debate,"This paper analyzes probability judgments about properties that can take multiple values (i.e., monadic polytomous events). It extends previous work on pattern-based deviations from standard (extensional) probabilities. Pattern-probabilities are formalized in Bayesian Logic (BL) and should be applicable when testing the overall adequacy of alternative logical hypotheses while allowing for exceptions. BL systematically predicts ‘conjunction fallacies’ (CFs) and, more generally, ‘inclusion fallacies’ (IFs), when a subset is deemed more probable than its superset. BL formalizes a fit between data and explanatory noisy-logical patterns and was supported in previous experiments on dyadic logical connectives with two dichotomous events. Here BL is extended to monadic prediction with several subclasses. BL may for instance predict Ppattern(A) > Ppattern(non-A) even though f(A) < f(non-A), given that non-A has more subclasses than A. Two experiments using material from the Linda paradigm corroborate a pattern approach and rule out confirmation as an alternative explanation.",>Momme von Sydow,">University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0431/index.html
2015,The Tragedy of Inner-Individual Dilemmas,"Social dilemmas specify situations in which (local) egoistic utility optimization prevents achieving the (global) common good of a group. Tragically, in such dilemmas local optimization also reduces the payoff for the individual optimizer. Although social dilemmas essentially reflect inter-individual contexts (conflicting interests, moral attitudes, etc.), inner-individual dilemmas apparently share at least some structural aspects with them: individual behavior can concern more conflicting levels of optimization. For example, starting additional academic projects with potentially positive ‘payoff’ may assume ‘more is more’. However, exogenous effects may arise from optimizing local goals; further contributions may incrementally reduce the quality of other contributions and yield ‘more is less’. In three experiments we explore a one-person investment game about building hotels, reflecting a social dilemma. The payoffs involve different optima for local and global optimization. Results show that people can be influenced by a default-strategy of ‘more is more’, even if it is irrational.",>Momme von Sydow,">University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0432/index.html
2015,Verbal Synchrony in Large Groups,"Metronomes, cells, neurons, fireflies, and human beings all fall into synchrony with each other, given the opportunity. Synchrony between people appears to generate social cohesion by increasing liking and feelings of togetherness. But the function of dancing, chanting and singing is not just to produce affiliative feelings, anthropologists have speculated, but also to improve group action. The group that chants and dances together hunts well together. Direct evidence for this is sparse, as research has mainly focused on studies of pairs, the effects of bodily movement, and measured cooperation and affiliative decisions. In contrast, in our experiment, large groups of people were studied, the synchrony of their verbal behaviour alone was manipulated, and in addition to affiliation, we measured their performance on a memory task and on a group action task. Our evidence suggests that the effects of synchrony are stable across modalities, and can be generalized to larger groups.",>Jorina von Zimmermann>Daniel Richardson,>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0433/index.html

The results showed high correlations between accuracy performance in the CU&C; and EF tasks even when Intelligence Ability (IA) and Age were partialed out. A path analytic model showed that performance in the CU&C; tasks could be explained by performance in the EF and IA tasks, which were positively related to each other. Further analyses showed that accuracy performance particularly in the CU&C; tasks could be predicted by performance in the EF tasks, with high or medium EF scores being a prerequisite for placement in the group of high CU&C; achievers.",>Stella Vosniadou>Dimitrios Pnevmatikos>Nikos Makris>Kalliopi Eikospentaki>Despina Lepenioti>Anna Chountala>Giorgos  Kyrianakis,">University of Athens, Greece>University of Western Macedonia, Greece>Democritus University, Greece>University of Athens, Greece>University of Athens, Greece>University of Athens, Greece>University of Western Macedonia, Greece",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0434/index.html

We tested children (ages 2 to 11) from two different cultural environments: the lowlands of Bolivia (Experiment 1), and the United States (Experiment 2). We presented children with toys hidden in envelopes to explore either with a familiar peer or without. Bolivian Tsimane’ children discovered significantly more objects with a peer, over and above the effect that would be expected from simply having two children search the toys independently in parallel. Additionally, Tsimane’ children discovered more objects as a function of age. Peer presence facilitated exploration in younger United States children but inhibited exploration in older United States children, relative to exploration rate without the peer. Taken together, peer presence facilitates exploration among young children across both cultures. The positive effect of peer presence on discovery rate may be driven by an increase in competition for resource control.",>Shirlene Wade>Celeste Kidd,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0435/index.html

Evidence from Bilingual Learners,"We investigated the developmental trajectory of number word learning in bilingual preschoolers to examine the relative contributions of two factors: (1) the construction of numerical concepts, and (2) the mapping of language-specific words onto these concepts. We found that children learn the meanings of small numbers independently in each language, indicating that the delay in the acquisition of small numbers is mainly due to language-specific processes of mapping words to concepts. In contrast, the logic and procedures of counting are learned simultaneously in both languages, indicating that these stages require the construction of numerical concepts that are not stored in a language-specific format.",>Katie Wagner>Katherine Kimura>Pierina Cheung>David Barner,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0436/index.html
2015,The “Fundamental Attribution Error” is rational in an uncertain world.,"Others’ internal qualities (e.g. dispositions, attitudes) are not directly observable so we must infer them from behavior. Classic attribution theories agree that we consider both internal qualities and situational pressure when making these judgments. However, one of the most well known ideas in psychology is that social judgments are biased, and we tend to underestimate the pressure that situations exert and overestimate the influence of disposition (known as the Fundamental Attribution Error). We propose that the social judgments made in classic studies of attribution have been interpreted as biased only because they have been compared to an inappropriate benchmark of rationality predicated on the assumption of deterministic dispositions and situations. We show that these results are actually consistent with the behavior of a simple ideal Bayesian observer who must reason about uncertain and probabilistic influences of situations and dispositions.",>Drew Walker>Kevin Smith>Ed Vul,>UCSD Psychology>UCSD Psychology>UCSD Psychology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0437/index.html

Using a between subjects design, one group of participants was primed with a melodic stream while performing a concurrent 2-back task while the other group was also primed with the melodic stream but did not perform a concurrent task. Participants were then given a melodic relational categorization task where relations (melodic contour) could either match or not match the primed melody. Reaction times on the categorization task for primed melodies were faster than for non-primed melodies, but only in the no-task condition, suggesting that relational information in melodies influenced behavior only under conditions where working memory resources were not being used. These results suggest that working memory may be a prerequisite for the processing of relational melodic content.",>Maegen Walker>Ahnate Lim>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0438/index.html
2015,The early emergence and puzzling decline of relational reasoning: Effects of prior knowledge and search on inferring “same” and “different”,"We explore the developmental trajectory and underlying mechanisms of relational reasoning. We describe a surprising developmental pattern: Younger learners are better than older ones at inferring abstract relations. Walker and Gopnik (2014) demonstrated that toddlers are able to infer the relations “same” and “different” in a causal system. However, these findings appear to contrast with the literature suggesting that older children have difficulty inferring these relations. Here we manipulate the data and children’s search procedure to assess the influence of these factors. In Experiment 1, we find that while younger children have no difficulty learning these relational concepts, older children fail to draw this abstract inference. In Experiment 2, we demonstrate that older children have learned the hypothesis that individual kinds of objects lead to effects. Finally, Experiment 3 indicates that including an explanation prompt during learning also improves performance. Findings are discussed in light of computational theories of learning.",>Caren Walker>Sophie Bridgers>Alison Gopnik,">University of California, Berkeley>Stanford University>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0439/index.html
2015,Disambiguation Across the Senses: The Role of Discovery-Based Interference,"When asked to find the referent of a novel label, children typically select an object that they cannot already name (the “disambiguation effect”; Merriman & Bowman, 1998). However, when the task required cross-modal extension of a label, children did not show this effect (Scofield, Hernandez-Reif, & Keith, 2009). In Experiments 1 and 2, preschoolers learned a label for a visual object, then examined it and a novel object by touch. On the critical trials, children were asked to decide which tactile object was the referent of a novel label. Four-year-olds only showed the disambiguation effect if, prior to the label test, they had identified the tactile object that matched the visual training object. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that the 4-year-olds expected to be asked about the matching object, which interfered with their tendency to disambiguate. This discovery-based interference appears to attenuate the use of common word learning strategies.",>Jenna Wall>William Merriman,>Kent State University>Kent State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0440/index.html

To that end, participants read easy and difficult texts while their eye movements were recorded. After each reading, participants filled-in comprehension questionnaires. We investigated classical measures of the reading process related to comprehension (fixation duration, regressive eye movements), as well as power-law scaling in eye movements that are indicative of degree of cognitive coordination during reading. The results show that text difficulty led to longer fixation durations and stronger power-law scaling in eye movements. Moreover, the degree of power-law scaling in eye movements was predictive of text comprehension. In line with previous research on natural text reading that utilized the self-paced reading method, power-law scaling turned out to be a superior predictor of reading comprehension compared to standard measures, suggesting that it is an effective measure of cognitive performance in complex reading tasks.",>Sebastian Wallot>Beth O'Brien>Charles Coey>Damian Kelty-Stephen,">Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark>National Institute of Education, Singapore>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA>Grinnell College, Grinnell, IA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0443/index.html
2015,Verbal Reports Reveal Strategies in Multiple-Cue Probabilistic Inference,"In multiple-cue probabilistic inference, people choose between alternatives based on several cues, each of which is differentially associated with an alternative’s overall value. Various strategies have been proposed for probabilistic inference. These include heuristics, simple strategies that ignore part of the available information to make decisions more quickly and with less effort. Heuristic models seek to explain the sequence of cognitive events that occur as people make decisions. Validating these models involves evaluating their predictions concerning both outcomes and process measures. In this study, we gathered verbal protocols from participants as they performed multiple-cue probabilistic inference. We find converging evidence across decisions, search behavior, and verbal reports that many participants use a simplifying heuristic, take-the-best. These results provide novel evidence for take-the-best as a process model of human decision behavior in multiple-cue probabilistic inference.",>Matthew Walsh>Michael Collins>Kevin Gluck,>TiER1 Performance Solutions>Air Force Research Laboratory>Air Force Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0444/index.html
2015,Musical improvisation: Multi-scaled spatiotemporal patterns of coordination,"When jazz musicians perform their behaviors are not fully prescribed in advance, nonetheless their actions become so tightly coordinated and their decisions so seamlessly intertwined that the musicians behave as a single synergistic unit rather than a collection of individuals. A fundamental aspect of such improvisation is the bodily movement coordination that occurs among performing musicians, with the embodied interaction of musicians both supporting and constraining musical creativity. Here we consider the ability of pairs of piano players to improvise, and demonstrate how the time-evolving patterns of inter-musician movement coordination as revealed by the mathematical tools of non-linear time series analyses can provide a new understanding of what potentiates the novelty of spontaneous musical action. Revealing the sophistication of the previously unexplored dynamics of movement coordination between improvising musicians is an important step towards understanding how creative musical expressions emerge from the spontaneous coordination of multiple musical bodies.",>Ashley Walton>Mike Richardson>Peter Langland-Hassan>Anthony Chemero>Auriel Washburn,>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0445/index.html
2015,Modeling the Object Recognition Pathway: A Deep Hierarchical Model Using Gnostic Fields,"To recognize objects, the human visual system processes information through a network of hierarchically organized brain regions. Many neurocomputational models have modeled this hierarchical structure, but they have often used hand-crafted features. According to the linear efficient coding hypothesis, the goal of the early visual pathway is to capture the statistical structure of sensory stimuli, removing redundancy, and factoring the input into independent features. In this work, we use a hierarchical ICA algorithm to automatically learn the visual features that account for early visual cortex. We then continue modeling the object recognition pathway using Gnostic Fields, a theory for how the brain does object categorization, in which brain regions devoted to classifying mutually-exclusive categories exist near the top of sensory processing hierarchies. The whole biologically-inspired model not only allows us to develop representations similar to those in primary visual cortex, but also to perform well on standard object recognition benchmarks.",>Panqu Wang>Garrison Cottrell>Christopher Kanan,">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego>Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California San Diego>Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0446/index.html

The participants then wrote completions to relative clause (RC) fragments. We found that participants who learn non-adjacent dependencies in the artificial language, exhibit a bias to write high-attachment (non-adjacent) continuations for RCs, when compared to participants in a control condition who exhibit low-attachment (adjacent) biases in RCs.

However, it is often assumed that the computational mechanisms behind extracting these dependencies are the same. We replicate the seminal finding that adults are capable of learning dependencies between non-adjacent words (Gómez, 2002). When we eliminate the positional information about the statistical structures by embedding the structure in phrases, learners can no longer learn the dependencies. Our methods allow us to study the learning mechanisms that are more representative of the patterns in natural languages, and show that when directly compared, adjacent and non-adjacent dependencies are not equally learnable. We suggest that learning non-adjacent dependencies in language involves a different computational mechanism from learning adjacent dependencies.",>Felix Wang>Toben Mintz,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0448/index.html
2015,Interpersonal Anticipatory Synchronization: The Facilitating Role of Short Visual-Motor Feedback Delays,"Effective interpersonal coordination is fundamental to robust social interaction, and the ability to anticipate a co-actor’s behavior is essential for achieving this coordination. However, coordination research has focused on the behavioral synchrony that occurs between the simple periodic movements of co-actors and, thus, little is known about the anticipation that occurs during complex, everyday interaction. Research on the dynamics of coupled neurons, human motor control, electrical circuits, and laser semiconductors universally demonstrates that small temporal feedback delays are necessary for the anticipation of chaotic events. We therefore investigated whether similar feedback delays would promote anticipatory behavior during social interaction. Results revealed that co-actors were not only able to anticipate others’ chaotic movements when experiencing small perceptual-motor delays, but also exhibited movement patterns of equivalent complexity. This suggests that such delays, including those within the human nervous system, may enhance, rather than hinder, the anticipatory processes that underlie successful social interaction.",>Auriel Washburn>Rachel Kallen>Charles Coey>Kevin Shockley>Michael Richardson,">Univeristy of Cincinnati , Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinati>University of Cincinnati",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0449/index.html
2015,Reasoning about sentience and animacy: Children’s and adults’ inferences about the properties of unseen entities,"One striking finding in developmental and cognitive psychology is that people make rich inferences about the intentions and experiences of objects that look nothing like humans or animals. What makes these scenarios appear social, not just mechanical? Three studies explore this foundational level of social cognition: the detection of sentience. We probe inferences among what we posit to be core components of the concept of sentience—affect, autonomy, and perception—as well as physical markers of inanimacy. We find that children and adults share the belief that a fact about one of these three “sentient properties” implies the presence of others, to a moderate degree. Meanwhile, information about sentience blocks inferences of inanimacy. This link between sentience and animacy is particularly strong for US adults and White children, while people from other cultural backgrounds demonstrate a more flexible construal of what kinds of objects might be sentient.",>Kara Weisman>Ellen Markman>Carol Dweck,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0450/index.html
2015,A Computational Model for Learning Structured Concepts From Physical Scenes,"Category learning is an essential cognitive mechanism for making sense of the world. Many existing computational category learning models focus on categories that can be represented as feature vectors, and yet a substantial part of the categories we encounter have members with inner structure and inner relationships. We present a novel computational model that perceives and learns structured concepts from physical scenes. The perception and learning processes happen simultaneously and interact with each other. We apply the model to a set of physical categorization tasks and promote specific types of comparisons by manipulating presentation order of examples. We find that these manipulations affect the algorithm similarly to human participants that worked on the same task. Both benefit from juxtaposing examples of different categories -- especially ones that are similar to each other. When juxtaposing examples from the same category they do better if the examples are dissimilar to each other.",>Erik Weitnauer>David Landy>Robert Goldstone>Helge Ritter,">Indiana University Bloomington>Indiana University Bloomington>Indiana University Bloomington>CITEC, Bielefeld University, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0451/index.html
2015,Reducing overconfidence in forecasting with repeated judgement elicitation,"Overconfidence is the tendency for people to underestimate the true range of uncertainty regarding unknown or future values. It results in observed outcomes falling outside people’s estimated ranges more often than their stated confidence would suggest. Previous research has, however, demonstrated various ways of reducing this bias and the More-Or-Less-Elicitation (MOLE) tool has been designed to take these into account while leading people through an elicitation. Previous research showed MOLE’s benefit on a visual estimation task but real world elicitation is more likely to involve forecasting future values. The current study compared forecast ranges, for 7 and 28 day windows, elicited via the MOLE and direct estimation. A significant reduction in overconfidence (the mismatch between stated confidence and the proportion of ranges containing the true value) was observed – from more than 25% to only 7%. We conclude that the MOLE is a useful tool for assisting forecasting.",>Matthew Welsh>Steve Begg,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0452/index.html
2015,Using Ground Truths to Improve Wisdom of the Crowd Estimates,"In this paper we explore a cognitive modeling approach to aggregating individuals' estimates of unknown quantities without natural bounds. We carried out two experiments that elicited individuals' estimates of the population of US metropolitan areas, and domestic box office returns for movies. We found that the means of individuals' responses correlate well with the true sizes, but participants systematically underestimated these values. We formulated a cognitive model that uses the true values of known items to correct for individuals' biases, and demonstrated that this model can drastically improve predictive accuracy. Because our model quantitatively infers individual's biases on the estimation tasks we were able to examine the distribution of individual biases, and found that there were substantial between-individual differences in the magnitude of the responses. This work demonstrates how individuals' biases, whether over- or underestimation, can be corrected using a cognitive model together with known ground truths.",>Andrew Whalen>Saiwing Yeung,">University St Andrews, St Andrews, Scotland, United Kingdom>Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, Beijing, China",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0453/index.html
2015,When killing the heavy man seems right. Making people utilitarian by simply adding options to moral dilemmas,"Trolley dilemmas are widely used to elicit moral intuitions. Most people do not think it would be morally right to push a heavy man from a bridge, thereby killing him, in order to avoid the death of several other people. Here we empirically tested a prediction by Unger (1996) who claims that adding more options to this scenario would shift people’s intuition from the normally preferred option of doing nothing to the utilitarian option of killing the heavy man. While not finding significant results with Unger’s original materials, an experiment with adapted materials confirmed the assumption that pushing one person is more likely to be preferred to not intervening if certain additional options are provided. Moreover, we found that moral intuitions are transferred from several-option cases to two-option cases (and the other way around). We discuss some possible psychological explanations for and normative implications of these findings.

2015,"We Readily Anchor Upon Others, But it is Easier to Anchor on the Self","Social inference research demonstrates that when thinking about minds similar to our own, we anchor and adjust away from ourselves (Tamir & Mitchell, 2013). However, relational self theory (Andersen & Chen, 2002) suggests the possibility of using knowledge about others as an anchor when they are more similar than ourselves to a target. We investigated whether social inferences are made on the basis of significant other knowledge through an anchor and adjustment process, and whether this ability would be reduced under load. Participants answered questions about their likes and habits, as well as those of a significant other, a target similar to their significant other, and a yoked control. Differences between the significant other and similar target were related to participants’ reaction time, and found the opposite effect for self and target, suggesting anchoring and adjustment from the significant other rather than the self. However, inferences about the others tended to be more similar to the self under load, suggesting that the self serves as the primary source of information about others.",>Daniel Willard>Art Markman,">University of Texas, Austin, Austin, Texas, USA>University of Texas",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0456/index.html

This process, known as reference resolution, has received much attention from both psycholinguists seeking to understand how humans process language and computer scientists seeking to improve the performance of language-capable agents. However, the majority of previous research has focused on what we term closed-world reference resolution, in which the set of possible referents is assumed to be known a priori.

Here we used a dual task paradigm to test the relative importance of verbal and visuo-spatial WM. Participants encoded either a series of digits (verbal load) or a series of dot locations in a grid (visuo-spatial load), and rehearsed them as they performed a discourse comprehension task, in which they watched a video of a man describing household objects, viewed a picture probe, and judged whether the picture was related to the video. Next, participants recalled either the verbally or visuo-spatially encoded information. Performance on the discourse comprehension task was always better when the speaker’s gestures were congruent than incongruent. However, the congruency advantage was smaller when the concurrent memory task involved a visuo-spatial load than when it involved a verbal load. Results suggest that taxing the visuo-spatial WM system reduced participants’ ability to benefit from gestural information.",>Ying Choon Wu>Bonnie Chinh>Seana Coulson,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0458/index.html

The present study thus experimentally manipulated infants’ production of pointing, and responses to pointing, to investigate the role of pointing in infants’ performance of forming novel word-object associations. Sixteen-month-olds were introduced to pairs of novel objects, and then heard the labels after they had pointed to an object, or when they were just looking at it, or at a predetermined time schedule. Results showed that children learned the labels the best when the labels were provided contingently after their pointing gesture.

2015,A fine-grained understanding of emotions: Young children match within-valence emotional expressions to their causes,"Previous research suggests that the ability to make fine-grained distinctions among emotions emerges gradually over development. However, such studies have looked primarily at children’s first-person responses to emotional expressions or at whether children can match emotion labels to emotional expressions. Relatively little work has looked at children’s ability to link emotional responses to their probable causes. Here we ask two, three, and four year-old children and adults to identify the causes of vocal expressions. We looked within a single valence and asked whether children could distinguish expressions elicited by exciting, delicious, adorable, funny, and sympathetic events. Our results suggest both an early emerging ability to distinguish within-valence emotions and rapid development; by four, children’s performance mirrored that of the adults. This suggests that very early in development, children have a rich representation of emotions that allows them to link distinct positively valenced emotional expressions to their probable causes.",>Yang Wu>Paul Muentener>Laura Schulz,>MIT>Tufts University>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0460/index.html
2015,Assessing Masked Semantic Priming: Cursor Trajectory versus Response Time Measures,"Measuring response times has been a staple for evaluating masked semantic priming. Its efficacy, however, has been challenged on several grounds — reported effect sizes of these studies are relatively small, and priming effects pertaining to response time measures are difficult to be replicated. Here, we report a complementary method — recording trajectories of a computer cursor. Participants judged whether two digits were the same or different, preceded by a briefly presented masked prime. Each prime had either positive or negative connotations, and the priming effects were evaluated either by response times or cursor trajectories associated with the area under the curve. Results indicate that the effect size of the congruency effect measured by cursor trajectories (i.e. area under the curve) was far greater than that measured by response times, suggesting that the cursor trajectory measure is more sensitive to masked semantic priming than the response time measure.",>Kunchen Xiao>Takashi Yamauchi>Casady Bowman,>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0461/index.html
2015,General Language Ability Predicts Talker Identification,"Individuals use both linguistic and non-linguistic features of the speech signal to identify talkers. Importantly, listeners have more difficulty identifying talkers in unfamiliar languages compared to a native language (language familiarity effect, or “LFE”). In the present study, the source of LFE on talker identification was investigated as listeners identified talkers in their native language as well as non-native languages. Experiment 1 explored the influence of L2 proficiency on talker identification across languages. Experiment 2 investigated individual differences in L1 phonetic perception and their contribution to talker identification by comparing listeners’ performance across different language conditions that varied in the availability of linguistic cues. Results imply that familiarity with a specific language (L1 or L2) did not explain individual variation in LFE. Rather, in addition to the native language benefit, talker identification may be supported by general sensitivity to speech sound structures, modulated by the availability of higher-level linguistic information.",>Xin Xie>Emily Myers,">University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, United States>University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0462/index.html
2015,A Computational Evaluation of Two Laws of Semantic Change,"For more than a century scholars have proposed laws of semantic change that characterize how words change in meaning over time. Two such laws are the law of differentiation, which proposes that near-synonyms tend to differentiate in meaning over time, and the law of parallel change, which proposes that related words tend to undergo parallel changes in meaning. Researchers have identified a handful of changes that are consistent with each proposed law, but there are no systematic evaluations that assess the validity and generality of these competing laws. Here we evaluate these laws by using a large corpus to assess how thousands of related words changed in meaning over the twentieth century. Our analyses show that the law of parallel change applies more broadly than the law of differentiation, and thereby illustrate how large-scale computational analyses can place laws of semantic change on a more secure footing.",>Yang Xu>Charles Kemp,">University of California, Berkeley>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0463/index.html
2015,Semantic chaining and efficient communication: The case of container names,"Semantic categories in the world’s languages often reflect a historical process of chaining: A name for one idea is extended to a conceptually related idea, and from there on to other ideas, producing a chain of concepts that all bear the same name. The beginning and end points of such a chain might in principle be conceptually rather dissimilar. There is also evidence supporting a contrasting picture: Languages tend to support efficient, informative communication, often through semantic categories in which all exemplars are similar. Here, we explore this tension through computational analyses of existing cross-language naming and sorting data from the domain of household containers. We find: (1) formal evidence for historical semantic chaining, and (2) evidence that systems of categories in this domain nonetheless support near-optimally efficient communication. Our results suggest that semantic chaining may be constrained by the functional need for efficient, informative communication.",>Yang Xu>Terry Regier>Barbara Malt,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>Lehigh University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0464/index.html

On the basis of this theoretical development, the authors investigate the extent to which cursor movements in a simple choice-reaching task reveal people’s emotions, such as anxiety. The results show that there is a strong correlation between cursor trajectory patterns and self-reported anxiety in male participants.

2015,Learning of Time Varying Functions is Based on Association Between Successive Stimuli,"In function learning, the to-be-learned function always defines the relationships between stimulus and response. However, when a function defines the stimuli by time points, we can call this type of function as time-varying function. Learning time-varying function would be different from learning other ones. Specifically, the correlation between successive stimuli should play an important role in learning such functions. In this study, three experiments were conducted with the correlations as positive high, negative high, and positive low. The results show people perform well when the correlation between successive stimuli is high, no matter whether it is positive or negative. Also, people have difficulty learning the time-varying function with a low correlation between successive stimuli. A simple two-layered neural network model is evident to be able to provide good accounts for the data of all experiments. These results suggest that learning time varying function is based on association between successive stimuli.",>Lee-Xieng Yang>Tzu-Hsi Lee,>National Chengchi University>National Chengchi University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0467/index.html

Our main result is an inequality obeyed by realist theories, which could be tested by a suitable experiment. We focus our attention in this contribution on two particular issues. The first is the exact notion of realism which is to be tested, as this has received less attention in earlier work. The second is an important technical issue about the inequality we use; in earlier work Atmanspacher and Filk (2010) considered a different expression, and we explain why our inequality is more suitable for use under realistic experimental conditions.",>James Yearsley>Emmanuel Pothos,">City University, London, United Kingdom>City University London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0468/index.html

However, how people learn these probability distributions is less well understood, especially for those that are not normal or unimodal. In this paper we focus on how people learn probability distributions that are bimodal. We examined on how the distance between the two peaks of a bimodal distribution and the numbers of observations influence how participants learn each distribution, using two types of stimuli with different degrees of perceptual noise. Overall, participants were able to learn the various distributions quickly and accurately. However, their performance is moderated by stimuli type---whether participants were learning a distribution over numbers (low noise) or over sizes of circles (high noise). This work suggests that although people are able to quickly learn a variety of distributions, many factors may influence their performance.",>Saiwing Yeung>Andrew Whalen,>Beijing Institute of Technology>University of St Andrews,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0470/index.html
2015,"Efficient analysis-by-synthesis in vision: A computational framework, behavioral tests, and modeling neuronal representations","A glance at an object is often sufficient to recognize it and recover fine details of its shape and appearance. How can vision be so rich, but at the same time fast? The analysis-by-synthesis approach offers an account of the richness of our percepts, but it is considered too slow to explain perception in the brain. Here we propose a version of analysis-by-synthesis that can be implemented efficiently, by combining a generative model based on a realistic 3D computer graphics engine with a recognition model based on a deep convolutional network. The recognition model initializes inference in the generative model, which is then refined by brief runs of MCMC. The model can reconstruct the approximate shape and texture of a novel face from a single view; it accounts quantitatively for human behavior in “hard” recognition tasks; and it qualitatively matches neural responses in a network of face-selective brain areas.",>Ilker Yildirim>Tejas Kulkarni>Winrich Freiwald>Joshua Tenenbaum,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Rockefeller University>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0471/index.html

If A said “I ate some of the cookies,” B should infer that A ate some but not all. Children perform poorly on experimental tests of scalar implicatures like this, despite their early-emerging sensitivity to pragmatic cues. Our current work explores factors responsible for children’s successes and failures for computing pragmatic inferences. In two experiments, we used eye-tracking to whether children compute implicatures when given access to contextual alternatives to the target word (Experiment 1), and when they hear prosodic cues that emphasize the contrast between the target and alternative (Experiment 2). We found that four-year-olds successfully identify the inferential referent in this paradigm; with supportive prosodic cues, we saw evidence of success in three-year-olds as well. In sum, with sufficient contextual support, preschool children are capable of making online pragmatic inferences.",>Erica J. Yoon>Yunan Charles Wu>Michael C.

2015,Linking Joint Attention with Hand-Eye Coordination – A Sensorimotor Approach to Understanding Child-Parent Social Interaction,"An understanding of human collaboration requires a level of analysis that concentrates on sensorimotor behaviors in which the behaviors of social partners continually adjust to and influence each other. In the present study, toddlers and their parents wore head-mounted eye-trackers as they played together with objects, which allowed us to track the gaze direction of each participant to determine when they attended to the same object. We found that physically active toddlers align their looking behavior with their parent, and achieve a high proportion of time spent jointly attending to the same object in toy play. Both infants and parents attend to their partner’s object manipulations and in so doing fixate the object visually attended by their partner. Moreover, dyad differences in joint attention are associated with dyad differences in hand following.

In this study we explore whether this mixture of goal-directed and faithful imitation is based in part on individual differences between children. Forty-eight 2-year-old children (mean age = 26 months) completed a series of imitation tasks. Results revealed stable individual differences in children’s imitation—measurements of their imitative behavior correlated both within and between different types of imitation tasks. We further used Principle Component Analyses to cluster these correlated measurements into two factors, and the two factors aligned well with the concepts of goal-directed and faithful imitation.",>Yue Yu>Tamar Kushnir,>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0474/index.html
2015,Signatures of Domain-General Categorization Mechanisms in Color Word Learning,"Learning color words is hard for young children. Because color is abstract, this difficulty has been attributed to challenges integrating over heterogeneous objects to discover color as a dimension of reference. On this account, learning that color words refer to the color dimension is slow, but subsequently mapping these words to particular shades is fast. Recent work suggests an alternative: Children may rapidly identify color as a referential dimension, but only gradually discover the precise boundaries of individual colors. This alternative predicts that the learning mechanisms underlying color-word acquisition should parallel those underlying the acquisition of concrete object categories. We confirm this prediction, finding that children's performance in color naming is modulated by three factors previously studied in category learning: input frequency, category size, and perceptual salience. Because it allows for precise measurement of category properties, color presents a unique case study for investigating language acquisition and categorization more broadly.",>Daniel Yurovsky>Katie Wagner>David Barner>Michael Frank,">Stanford University>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0475/index.html

It is still unclear, however, what the basis is of individual differences in their success at transfer. In this study, 75 subjects had been trained to solve a set of mathematical problems before they were put into the fMRI scanner, where they were challenged to solve modified versions of familiar problems. A hidden semi-Markov model identified the sequential structure of thought when solving the problems. Analyzing the patterns of brain activity over the sequence of states, we observed that subjects who showed consistent brain patterns performed better. This consistency refers to both how consistently subjects respond to different problems (within-subject consistency), and how brain responses of a given subject deviate from the population average (between-subjects consistency).

However, there is still debate regarding how learners accumulate distributional information to learn object labels in natural learning environments, and what underlying learning mechanism learners are most likely to adopt. Using the Human Simulation Paradigm (Gillette, Gleitman, Gleitman & Lederer, 1999), we found that participants’ learning performance gradually improved and that their ability to remember and carry over partial knowledge from past learning instances facilitated subsequent learning. These results support the statistical learning model that word learning is a continuous process.",>Yayun Zhang>Daniel Yurovsky>Chen Yu,>Indiana University>Stanford University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0478/index.html

2015,A Bayesian hierarchical model of local-global processing: Visual crowding as a case-study,"We explore the interaction between local-global information processing in visual perception, leveraging a visual phenomenon known as crowding, whereby the perception of a target is impaired by the presence of nearby flankers. Most of the established models explain the crowding effect in terms of local interactions. However, recent experimental results indicate that a classical crowding effect, the deterioration in the discrimination of a vernier stimulus embedded in a square, is alleviated by the presence of additional flankers (uncrowding). Here, we propose that crowding and uncrowding arise from cortical inferences about hierarchically organized groups, and formalize this concept using a hierarchical Bayesian model. We show that the model reproduces crowding and uncrowding for flanked vernier discrimination. More generally, the model provides a normative explanation of how visual information might simultaneously flow bottom-up, top-down, and laterally, to allow the visual system to process local and global features in the visual scene interactively.",>Shunan Zhang>Man Song>Angela Yu,>UCSD>UCSD>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0480/index.html

However, little is known about whether and when VPT can be triggered spontaneously without any explicit verbal prompting. In six studies, we measured spontaneous VPT as the tendency to read an ambiguous number from another agent’s imagined perspective (“6”) rather than from one’s own default visual perspective (“9”). We found that the likelihood of spontaneous VPT varied systematically with the target agent’s behavior. The strongest trigger for spontaneous VPT was the agent’s goal-directed reaching, followed by object-directed gaze, and lastly the agent’s mere presence in the scene. Furthermore, observing an agent’s reaching or gaze toward an object triggered viewers’ spontaneous VPT even for objects with which the agent was currently not engaged.",>Xuan Zhao>Corey Cusimano>Bertram F.

2015,The Impact of Granularity on Worked Examples and Problem Solving,"In this paper, we explore the impact of two types of instructional interventions, worked examples and problem solving, at two levels of granularity: problems and steps. This study drew on an existing Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for Probability called Pyrenees and involved 266 students who were randomly assigned to five conditions. All students experienced the same procedure, studied the same training problems in the same order, and used the same ITS. The conditions differed only in how the training problems were presented. Our results show that when the domain content and required steps are strictly equivalent, different granularities of pedagogical decisions can significantly impact students’ time on task. More specifically, the fine-grained step level decisions can have a stronger pedagogical impact than the problem-level ones.",>Guojing Zhou>Thomas Price>Collin Lynch>Tiffany Barnes>Min Chi,">North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States>North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States>North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States>North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States>North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0482/index.html
2015,More Than a Blood Pump: An Experimental Enquiry of the Folk Theory of the Heart,"The present research sought to address an intriguing yet heretofore unanswered question with the tools of experimental psychology: Do people today still subscribe to the outdated folk belief that the heart is a mental organ, governing certain, if not all, aspects of mental life—a belief we termed cardiopsychism? The results from multiple experiments provided converging evidence for the conclusion that cardiopsychism is still very much alive in the minds of modern people. Aside from demonstrating the continued presence of cardiopsychism, we explored both the antecedent and consequence of holding this misconception. Through cross-cultural comparison, we found evidence suggesting that the conventionalized heart-expressions people speak might be responsible for perpetuating cardiopsychism. In addition, our hypothetical scenario study indicated that the perseverance of cardiopsychism might be more than just an innocuous glitch but could have real-world impacts.",>Haotian Zhou>Cacioppo John,>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0483/index.html
2015,"You say potato, I say tŭdòu: How speakers of different languages share the same concept","When a speaker of English and a speaker of Chinese think about the same object, their brains are representing a shared concept. However, we don’t know how similarity in the concepts evoked by words is manifested in the brains of speakers of different languages. We have previously shown that neural similarity relations are strongly conserved across subjects, allowing across-subject decoding. Here we extend that result to translating word-elicited activations across groups of speakers of Chinese and English. Specifically, by matching the neural similarity relations elicited by a set of seven Chinese words, presented to Chinese speakers, with the neural similarities elicited by the equivalent English words presented to English speakers, we are able to translate between the English and Chinese words with 100% accuracy, based only on the patterns of functional activity that they elicit. This demonstration provides evidence for the conservation of semantic relations between concepts across different languages.",>Benjamin Zinszer>Andrew Anderson>Olivia Kang>Thalia Wheatley>Rajeev Raizada,">University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA>University of Rochester, Rochester, NY>Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH>Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH>University of Rochester, Rochester, NY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0484/index.html

2015,The Eco-Cognitive Model of Abduction (EC-Model). Is Abduction Really Ignorance-Preserving?,"From the logical point of view, abduction is a procedure in which something that lacks classical explanatory epistemic virtue can be accepted because it has virtue of another kind: the GW-Model contends that abduction presents an ignorancepreserving or (ignorance-mitigating) character. From this perspective abductive reasoning is a response to an ignoranceproblem. Is abduction really ignorance-preserving? To better answer this question I will take advantage of my eco-cognitive model (EC-model) of abduction. It will be illustrated, also thanks to cognitive and epistemological considerations, that through abduction, knowledge can be enhanced, even when abduction is not considered an inference to the best explanation in the classical sense of the expression, that is an inference necessarily characterized by an empirical evaluation phase.",>Lorenzo Magnani,">University of Pavia, Italy",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0486/index.html
2015,How the curse of intractability can be cognitive science's blessing,"Intractability has been a thorny issue in cognitive science. Informally, intractability refers to the problem that computations that work for small toy domains cannot scale to domains of real-world complexity due to prohibitive resource consumption. It’s not uncommon for cognitive scientists to try to discredit competing frameworks by pointing out that those frameworks run into intractability issues. For instance, connectionists and Bayesians have argued against symbolic and logic approaches, respectively, because the latter two would yield intractable theories of cognition. Yet, it’s now well known that also connectionist and Bayesian theories can be intractable. Moreover, even heuristic and dynamical systems theories, both often lauded for being tractable, seem unable to live up to that image when forced to scale beyond toy domains. Evidently, intractability is not a problem for specific theories, or even for specific theoretical frameworks. Instead, it seems a ubiquitous feature of frameworks with high degrees of generality.",>Iris van Rooij,">Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0487/index.html
2015,Multiscale clustering of vocalizations during naturalistic infant-caregiver interactions,"We quantified the multiscale clustering in the acoustics of infant prelinguistic vocalizations, the development across the first two years of life, and the relationship between caregivers’ vocalizations for fifteen infant-caregiver dyads. The multiscale structure of infant utterances, spanning from seconds to over one hour was similar to that of caregivers, providing new evidence for the multiscale clustering of prelinguistic utterances. Additionally, we found that the multiscale clustering statistics of infant vocalizations and caregiver vocalizations matched even when controlling for other vocalization properties such as volubility, and more matching occurred for infant speechlike vocalizations relative to non-speechlike vocalizations. The matching of multiscale clustering statistics between two people is termed Complexity Matching. We provide a discussion regarding the notion of hierarchical rhythmic organization in infant language development. Complexity matching sheds new light on the coupling between infant and caregiver vocalizations, and may help to advance current theories of infant speech development.",>Drew Abney>Anne Warlaumont>D.

2015,Priming Dynamic-Kinematic Routines Using Spatial Language,"Along with using geometric information to define spatial terms such as “in”, Coventry and Garrod (2004) have proposed the use of dynamic-kinematic (DK) routines which relate to how two objects interact (kinematic) over time (dynamic). For the spatial description, “The penny is in the bowl,” the penny is contained by a bounding box around the bowl as well as the DK location-control routine that if the bowl moves, so will the penny. In two experiments a speeded prime/ probe picture-sentence verification task was used to gather evidence for the existence of DK routines. The first experiment found evidence for priming location-control for the preposition “in”. The second experiment examined location-control routines for both “in” and “on” using the same prepositions for both location-control and embedded spatial relationships. A significant response time benefit for priming location-control routines was found. These experiments provided evidence for priming location-control routines independent of semantic priming.",>Deanne Adams>Christopher Galeucia>Jennifer Kolesari>Laura Carlson>Kenny Coventry,>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame>University of East Anglia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0489/index.html

Here we aimed to shed light on this issue be recording event-related potentials while participants performed a modified stop-signal task that allowed us to compare the following conditions: successful versus unsuccessful response inhibitions, successful response inhibitions versus successful response executions, and easy versus difficult response inhibitions. Electrophysiological activity related to response inhibition was best isolated by comparing easy and difficult inhibitions. This activity was observed at fronto-central scalp electrodes between 260 and 300 milliseconds after stop-stimulus presentation. Notably, the stop-signal reaction time (an estimate of the time required to inhibit the motor response) fell within this window interval.",>Jacobo Albert>Alberto Sánchez-Carmona>Gerardo Santaniello>Sara López-Martín>Jose Antonio Hinojosa,">Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain>Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain>Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain>Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain>Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0490/index.html
2015,A Theory of Information Processing for Large-Scale Brain Networks,"How much information does a large-scale cortical network process when it's conscious and/or unconscious? Can the complexity of such networks be quantified and be coupled to brain function and consciousness? Recently, measures of network complexity such as integrated information have been proposed. However, we show that these approaches are computationally intractable for realistic brain networks. We propose alternative quantifications that allow precise computations for large-scale networks including their stochastic dynamics, plasticity and perturbations. Even for stable stationary dynamics our measure shows that the processed information of a realistic network sharply rises at the edge of criticality. In particular, we demonstrate that the specific topology of the human brain generates greater informational complexity compared to randomly rewired networks. We analyze to what extent these results and their associated measures are specific to levels of consciousness or simply a hallmark of how neuronal systems process information.",>Xerxes Arsiwalla>Paul Verschure,">Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain>Universitat Pompeu Fabra & ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0491/index.html
2015,Cognitive representations of form in pop music: A probabilistic grammars approach,"Cognitive representations of musical structure have long been of interest to psychologists and musicians. This project addresses comprehension of and long-term memory for musical form, a debated topic in music cognition. We use three methods: a corpus of Billboard magazine's top 10 songs for each of the last 20 years; a probabilistic grammar derived from this corpus; and an experiment testing predictions of the grammar. Two statistical analyses of the corpus are presented here, dealing with its zero- and first-order Markov properties. These provide a probablistic grammar of form in popular songs. We have tested this grammar by prompted recall of listeners' memory for popular songs they claim to know well. Recalls average over 70% correct; errors in these recalls most often correspond to low-frequency 2-tuples in our networks. Our results show that listeners learn statistical regularities of form in popular music, much as they learn melodic and harmonic structure.",>Richard Ashley,>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0492/index.html
2015,Cognitive Flexibility in Mathematics: Bilingual Children Show Cognitive Advantages,"Mathematical problem solving requires cognitive flexibility. Bilingual children show advantages in cognitive flexibility as compared to monolingual children. Whether this bilingual cognitive advantage extends to mathematical skills is the focus of the present study. To measure children’s use of cognitive flexibility, worksheets containing 60 arithmetic problems of different operations were administered to first- through fifth-grade monolingual and bilingual children; children were given 60 seconds to complete as many grade-appropriate problems as possible. Performance on the math worksheet was analyzed as the number of problems completed and solved correctly. Results indicate that bilingualism affects arithmetic problem solving in third- through fifth-graders (problems completed: F(1,24)=9.20, p<.01; accuracy: F(1,24)=3.30, p=.08) but not first- and second-graders (problems completed: F(1,38)=0.38, p=.54; accuracy: F(1,38)=0.83, p=.37). Findings from this study thus suggest that bilingual cognitive flexibility extends to mathematical problem solving, and that this cognitive flexibility develops over the elementary school years in bilingual children.",>Natsuki Atagi>Catherine Sandhofer,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0493/index.html
2015,Tense systems across languages support efficient communication,"All languages have ways of expressing location in time, but they differ widely in their grammatical tense systems. At the same time, there are tense systems that recur across unrelated languages. What explains this wide but constrained variation? Taking a functionalist perspective, we propose that tense systems are shaped by the need to support efficient communication–a need that has recently been shown to explain cross-language semantic variation in other domains. We test this proposal computationally against the tense systems of 64 languages. We find that most languages in the sample support near-optimally efficient communication, but with some interesting and potentially illuminating exceptions. We conclude that efficient communication may play an important role in explaining why tense systems vary across languages in the ways they do.",>Geoff Bacon>Yang Xu>Terry Regier,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0494/index.html

Like error bars on graphs, it is a discrete visualization of a graded probability function. Two experiments examined the effectiveness of different visualizations of location estimates varying whether and how uncertainty was visualized (uniform blue circle showing confidence interval, faded circle showing graded probability, or both). Given a known location and visualizations of the estimates of two “smartphones” of that location, participants judged which smartphone showed the better location estimation. Participants reported using two primary heuristics (1) choosing the blue circle that was closest to the known location (distance) and (2) choosing the smaller circle (size). Visualizing graded probability with faded circles biased participants towards the distance heuristic. Visualizing confidence intervals with uniform circles biased participants towards the size heuristic (and using uncertainty information) and produced more accurate judgments.",>Trevor Barrett>Mary Hegarty>Grant McKenzie>Michael Goodchild,>University of California Santa Barbara>University of California Santa Barbara>University of California Santa Barbara>University of California Santa Barbara,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0496/index.html

2015,It's all in the eye: multiple orders of motor planning in gaze control,"It has been shown that the eyes anticipate the target of the next manual object interaction. Meanwhile, manual interactions anticipate object features for grasp adjustments (first order) and the most convenient end-state in anticipation of subsequent tasks (second order). Moreover, grasping kinematics for the same object can vary depending on the final goal (third order planning). In an eye-tracking experiment we show that these factors can be measured already in eye fixations prior to grasping objects with different orientations (upright vs. inverted) and for different tasks (drink vs. hand over). Fixation measures show significant effects of object, task, and orientation and significant interactions. These results show for the first time end-state comfort effects in the eyes and suggest a tighter coupling of oculo-motor and motor programming than assumed so far. The insights suggest that even more intricate derivations of manipulation intentions can be derived from eye gaze data.",>Anna Belardinelli>Martin V.

Previous research suggests that we mentally simulate fictive motion (Matlock 2004, Matlock & Bergmann, in press), but little is known about the use of fictive motion in real discourse. Our study is the first to look at discourse data, analyzing videos taken from the TV News Archive containing fictive motion utterances. Our results show that the conceptual structure of the trajector (road, scar) influences both gestures produced with the utterance and linguistic properties of the utterance. Our study not only shows how fictive motion is used in speech, but also provides more insight on the mental processes involved in understanding and producing fictive motion, and more generally, figurative language.",>Till Bergmann>Teenie Matlock,>UC Merced>UC Merced,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0499/index.html
2015,Valence vs. Value in Decision-Making in Depression,"Individuals with elevated symptoms of depression exhibit deficits in decision-making. Depressed individuals show decreased sensitivity to rewards, but increased sensitivity to punishments. This may be critical to understanding depression-related decision-making deficits, yet the computational nature of these effects is poorly understood. Participants (N=161) completed a decision-making task wherein they chose between two options on each of 150 trials. Rewards for both options were drawn from skewed-normal distributions with mean reward values of 0 points. For one option the reward distribution was positively skewed—more frequently giving losses than gains. For the other option the reward distribution was negatively skewed—more frequently giving gains than losses. Preference for the negatively-skewed option increased linearly as a function of the degree of depressive symptoms. Modeling analyses indicate that depressive symptoms are associated with less effective processing of reward magnitude and greater reliance on reward valence (gains vs. losses) in decision-making.",>Nathaniel Blanco>W.

2015,"Bridging the communicative gap between robots and humans, by analogy","The ability to create and understand novel communicative signals is exemplary of people’s creative and inferential abilities. For example, when traveling and unable to speak the local language, we can make ourselves understood by creating novel gestures. This ability is a form of abductive inference, and requires people to generate novel hypotheses about possible meanings of signals (abduction proper). We propose that novel hypotheses may be generated from scratch by re-conceptualizing perceptual and conceptual representations through analogical augmentation. We plan to use robotics methodology to assess the plausibility of this model. By enhancing a robot with analogical augmentation we aim to enable it to generate novel gestures based on analogies. This lays the groundwork for more natural human-robot interaction. Furthermore, by studying the robot’s gestures and to what extent people can understand them, we gain better understanding of the abduction-based computational processes underlying communication.",>Mark Blokpoel>Todd Wareham>J.p. de Ruiter>Pim Haselager>Ivan Toni>Iris van Rooij,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands>Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada>CiTeC, Bielefeld, North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany>Radboud University, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0501/index.html

This test requires participants to select two of four answer choices that are rotations of a probe stimulus. The incorrect choices (i.e., foils) are either mirror reflections of the probe or structurally different. Two experiments investigated the hypothesis that males notice structural differences more than females and a strategy of capitalizing on structural differences, accounts for the gender difference. Trials with structurally different foils showed higher accuracy and faster reaction times for both males and females. A significant male advantage was found for both foil trial types; however, an interaction between trial type and gender was not present. Moreover, males and females did not differ in reaction time. Thus, no evidence was found to suggest that strategy differences account for the large gender difference in mental rotation tasks.",>Alexander Boone>Mary Hegarty,">University of California - Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA>University of California Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0502/index.html

Previous evidence suggests that essentialism is stronger for masculine than feminine properties and more evident in monolingual than bilingual children. Here, we investigated essentialism of gender by monolingual and bilingual adults, focusing on two distinct dimensions of essentialism: naturalness (regarding categories as natural kinds) and entitativity (regarding categories as homogeneous groups). Participants indicated their agreement with statements assessing beliefs about men and women on these two dimensions. The results replicated previous work showing that men are essentialized more than women, but revealed that this effect may be specific to the entitativity dimension. We also found that, compared to monolinguals, bilinguals were less likely to essentialize gender in terms of naturalness. Our findings converge with previous research highlighting the bidimensionality of essentialism and suggest that early effects of language experience on essentialist beliefs may persist into adulthood.",>Jacob Brodsky>Kevin Holmes,>Colorado College>Colorado College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0504/index.html

We sought evidence of lasting encoding changes for mathematical objects for participants who used an Algebraic Transformations PLM and compared them to a Control group who did a different task, one that did not target PL of equation structure, but provided equal exposure to the same equations as in the PLM. All participants completed a speeded same/different psychophysical task comparing equations at pretest and delayed posttest. The PLM group improved on the psychophysical task more than controls, demonstrating that PLM structure, not mere exposure to equations, caused the information encoding gains.

The current research investigates the relationship between the participant’s physical location and orientation in accurately placing the location and orientation of another individual onto a map – essentially creating a YAH map for another individual. The other individual’s location and orientation was conveyed to the participant using a photograph. The photographs were of highly familiar building facades from around campus, which were oriented towards the cardinal directions. This research reveals how the participant’s location and orientation interacts with the photographer’s location and orientation, given the properties of the environment.

Our sample (N=69) compares children and adults ranging in age from 5 to 48 years old (mean=19.6, SD=12.1) with levels of education (Spanish-based) ranging from no formal education to some college. Since the use of plural morphology is not optional in Spanish, this is a particularly interesting test of the effects of education in Spanish on sentence production in Yucatec Maya. Mixed effects logit models reveal that set size is a significant predictor of the use of plural morphology and numeral mention.

We have developed a tool to generate Heider-Simmel-like videos. In contrast to the Heider-Simmel Interactive Theater project by Andrew Gordon and colleagues, though, our tool enables the generation of story-lines. The user is offered a manifold of individual object behaviors, such as approaching, avoiding, or circling around another object, and a manifold of perceptual events, such as the detection of another object, the touch of another object, etc. Behavior-event complexes can be chosen and concatenated by an intuitive user interface. The resulting story lines are then played-out by the tool in different scenarios, yielding different videos about socially similar interactions.

However, the precise mechanism that underlies this effect remains unclear, and prior modeling efforts have been unable to pinpoint specific gender differences in behavioral aspects of the IGT. Our results replicated the behavioral gender difference finding and showed that females select the disadvantageous Deck B more than males. We fit the data with versions of the Expectancy Valence and Prospect Valence Learning models that included a parameter to account for participants' perseverative tendencies. The addition of this parameter to the models led to a substantial improvement in the fit to the data. An examination of the best fitting parameter differences suggests that females give greater weight to recent events than males, which may lead females to discount the large, infrequent losses given by Deck B more and select that option more frequently.",>Kaileigh A.

Past research has shown that the salience of landmarks can influence their use, with salience based on perceptual features, or on the spatial relation between the landmark and a target location. In two experiments, students were asked to give directions to locations on campus to other students, alumni, or visitors. In Experiment 1, speakers’ ratings of the imaginability and frequency of use for 20 buildings along the directed paths impacted whether they were included in their directions to other students. In Experiment 2, these features did not impact speakers’ directions to alumni or visitors, suggesting a different prioritization of salience.

We propose to create a large stimulus set of spatial relations that covers the space of possible relations in a more comprehensive way and includes the TRPS as a subset. The extended set will be systematically generated from a large family of spatial features describing relations between figure and ground objects, such as contact, support, attachment-by-spiking, and others that have been previously proposed.

An important question is the degree to which past exploration and learning experiences affect exploration in novel contexts. In particular, children often get information about the difficulty of a completed task (“that was hard!”), but we do not know whether such information affects how children approach new tasks. We present preschoolers with information about an initial task, explaining that it was hard or easy (or no information). Preschoolers are then invited to explore a novel toy where no information about the difficulty of the toy is given. We find that preschoolers explore and discover more features following information that the initial task was difficult, than following easy or neutral descriptions. We suggest that children are extending expectations about previous events to novel ones.",>Amanda Castro>Elizabeth Bonawitz,">Rutgers University , Newark , New Jersey , USA>Rutgers University, Newark",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0512/index.html
2015,Using Wordless Picture Books during Shared Reading Boost Language Production in Preschoolers,"Prior research shows that shared book reading promotes preschoolers´ language and literacy skills. However, little is known about the potential role of books´ features –e.g., wordless picture books vs. books with text– in children and teachers´ spontaneous language production. In this study, we transcribed verbal interactions of thirteen Colombian teachers reading to groups of preschooler students (aged 43 to 55 months) during reading sessions in Spanish using wordless picture books (condition 1) and prototypical storybook with text (condition 2). Books were matched for page length, genre and theme. Using Computerized Language Analysis (CLAN), we found important differences in children and teachers´ spontaneous language production. Specifically, paired t-test comparisons revealed that in the wordless-picture-book condition: (a) children produced significantly more word tokens, word types, utterances and questions (all p´s < .05), and (b) teachers produced significantly more word tokens, questions and levels of instructional support (all p´s <.05).",>Leydi Chaparro-Moreno>Florencia Reali>Carolina Maldonado-Carreño,">Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia>Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia>Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0513/index.html
2015,The Breadth and Depth of E-reading and Paper-reading,"The present study investigated the differences between e-reading and paper-reading in their breadth and depth. Our results showed that (1) breadth and depth of reading were both greater in e-reading than in paper-reading; (2) possession of a tablet tended to facilitate breadth of e-reading; (3) breadth of e-reading was greater than breadth of paper-reading for news, magazines, and others, but not for novels; (4) depth of e-reading was greater than depth of paper-reading for novels, but the reverse was true for news and magazines; (5) people tended to read research articles, books and magazines on paper, but news and others on digital devices; (6) people tended to read longer on paper than on digital devices, but the percentage of contents they could remember was no different between e-reading and paper-reading.

2015,Analyze Chinese Lexicon Project in the Chinese Character norms of traditional scripts,"Chinese Lexicon Project (Sze et al., 2014) summarized lexical decision response data of 2,500 Chinese characters. The original analysis has showed that the newest character frequency norm accounts the most variance of reaction times. The variance of these response data are analyzed in terms of the character frequency, strokes, and structures in use of the norms from Taiwan. First of all, simplified characters ranked as high frequency have greater performance on reaction times, but these characters ranked as lower frequency in traditional scripts have overestimated response points. Secondly many simplified characters are transformed from complex to simple, and strokes are substantial discrepancy between Chinese scripts. Finally, stuructre of character takes a large proportion of variance in the response data. The covariance of structure and character frequency also shows a significant trend. Our current work reveals some critical thinkings on using mega-data as the approach to study Chinese character processing.",>Sau-chin Chen>Chung-Ching Wang>Jon-Fan Hu,">Department of Human Development, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>Department of Psychology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0515/index.html
2015,Implicit Association in Mathematics and Science,"Previous work using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) has revealed an implicit association between academic disciplines and gender (Nosek et al., 2002). Namely, participants appear to have an implicit association between men and science, and women and the humanities. The purpose of this research is to examine whether the former implicit association is rooted in an association between men and mathematics or math-heavy fields. This might explain the fact of relatively low representation by women in math-heavy sciences, and relatively high representation by women in areas of science that do not require advanced mathematical training. One hypothesis is that this difference in representation can be at least partially explained by an implicit association between math or math-intensive fields and men. We hypothesize that subjects will exhibit an implicit association between women and non-math intensive sciences, and men and math-intensive sciences.

2015,Age differences in information search: An exploration-exploitation tradeoff model,"Past research often found that older adults searched less in terms of browsing and generating keywords; few studies examined the processes and underlying mechanism that caused the age-related reduction on search. In the current study, 20 younger and older adults performed ill-defined search tasks with a search box we implemented. In addition to the age differences in the quantities of search, results showed that there were qualitative age differences in allocating resources to exploration and exploitation across tasks varying in difficulties. Older adults were found to do more exploitation within one information cluster as defined by the keywords than younger adults. There was also age difference in the ways to reformulate keywords, that older doing more total changes in keywords and younger doing more partial changes in terms of narrowing or broadening the search. The links between search processes and the age differences in cognitive profiles were also discussed.",>Jessie Chin>Evan Anderson>Chieh-Li Chin>Wai-Tat Fu,">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, UIUC>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0517/index.html
2015,An Embodied Cognition Approach to Studying Emotional Words: The Impact of Positive Facial Experiences on Semantic Properties Judgment,"Embodied cognition is a theory that emphasizes the importance of sensorimotor experiences for cognition. Therefore, the present study focused on how the facial expression manipulation influences the property judgments toward Chinese emotional words. 41 college students were divided into “biting the pen with smile” group and control group to rate the same 26 Chinese emotional words chosen from a Chinese Emotions Corpora (Cho, Chen, and Cheng, 2013). After having the instructed expression, subjects evaluated several semantic dimensions of emotional words immediately. The findings show that the “biting the pen with smile” group has higher rating values for dimension ‘valence’, ‘frequency’ and ‘continuance’ for the ‘disgust’ words, and the dimension ‘valence’ for the ‘angry’ words. The study found that positive facial expression indeed influenced the semantic properties of negative words, not the positive emotional words. The results are useful for investigating how word meaning is built in children and clinical applications.",>Ching Chu>Chi-Lin Yu>Ya-Yun Chuang>Yueh-Lin Tsai>Jon-Fan Hu,">National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0518/index.html
2015,Conceptual Combination Modulated by Action using Tangible Computers,"We studied the role of action in a conceptual combination task by varying whether word stimuli could be physically grasped and arranged (words displayed individually on tangible cubes) or only touched and pointed to (words printed on a poster paper). Middle-school aged participants combined nouns from different taxonomic categories then described creative meanings. Descriptions contained more between-category relations (e.g., “shaped like” and “looks like” analogies) in the poster condition than when combining words using cubes. Conversely, participants produced more within-category descriptions (e.g., taxonomic declarations “it’s a X”, and metaphorically blended categories) when interacting with cubes than with a poster. These results suggest embodied explanations, and are consist with developmental studies that find categorization is differentially organized by shape and taxonomy. We propose that hardcopy and traditional keyboard-display computers which afford pointing and touching may engage categorization differently than tangible computers based on physical objects which afford grasping and arranging.",>Timothy Clausner>Mary Lou Maher>Berto Gonzales,">University of Maryland>University of North Carolina, Charlotte>University of North Carolina, Charlotte",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0519/index.html
2015,Violence Metaphors in Presidential Debates,"In an election year, political messaging can become feisty or even violent. In the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Americans were inundated with statements that metaphorically referred to violence, such as “Romney slams Obama” and”Romney slaughtered Obama.” Such expressions grab our attention and resonate with our understanding of actual physical violence. Despite their frequent use in election discourse, little is known about how such messages affect voters. Here we report the results of a novel experiment that examines how varying degree of violence in these metaphors influences inferences people make about politicians and election outcomes. Our results indicate that participants perceive candidates differently depending on degree of violence in descriptions of their performance in presidential debates. The results are informative and valuable because they shed new light on how framing works in election messages, especially how varying source domain information can lead to notable differences in reasoning.",>Chelsea Coe>Till Bergmann>Teenie Matlock,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0520/index.html
2015,Optimal stopping in a natural sampling task,"Sampling biases are often assumed to arise from the type of information that learners sample (Fiedler, 2008), the possibility of negative payoffs (Denrell, 2001), or the prevalence of small samples (Kareev et al., 2002). Here, we show that even in a natural sampling situation (repeated Bernoulli trials), in which a learner's only decision is when to stop sampling, different sampling goals can have an impact on sample composition and on inferences drawn from them. Specifically, we find that learners sampling with a binary goal (""more heads/tails?"") versus a distributional goal (""how many heads?"") end up with samples that differ not only in size but also content. Binary sampling leads to more samples with extreme distributions (many more heads or tails) compared to distributional sampling. In this project, we explore the impact of those sampling goals on subsequent decision-making on the basis of those samples.",>Anna Coenen>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0521/index.html
2015,Exemplar models can’t see the forest for the trees,"We investigated human learning and generalization of three novel category structures based on eight exemplars in a continuous (9x9) stimulus space. Each category requires attention to both dimensions, but they differ in their organization. Critically, all three category types are matched on within- and between-category exemplar distances. The first category structure conforms to a condensation or information-integration type of problem with two classes separable by a diagonal bound. The other category structures cannot be solved with a linear decision boundary. We found that learners trained on the diagonal bound structure showed significantly better learning and generalization performance. In computational simulations, we found that an exemplar model (ALCOVE) could not account for the observed pattern. We posit that ALCOVE is constrained by the matched distances to learn these category structures at the same speed. Another similarity-based model with different basic design principles (DIVA) provided a good account of the behavioral data.",>Nolan Conaway>Kenneth Kurtz,>Binghamton University>Binghamton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0522/index.html
2015,That's not the whole story: The role of reliability and credibility in evidential reasoning,"How do people reason about complex bodies of legal evidence? The story model of juror decision-making posits that people construct stories to determine guilt. But the story model does not model how evidence items relate to elements within the story, how the credibility and reliability of the evidence (e.g., witness testimony) is assessed, or how this affects story evaluation. Recent empirical work suggests that people reason using qualitative causal networks. In two studies mock jurors read a real legal case and judged the probability of the defendant’s guilt, the credibility of the victim and of key witnesses. Study 1 showed that an inconsistent testimony decreased the victim’s credibility and defendant’s guilt, also increasing the defendant’s credibility. Study 2 replicated this finding with a different population. These findings suggest that people draw inferences about credibility and reliability of evidence that filter into their network of beliefs about the crime.",>Saoirse Connor Desai>David Lagnado,">City University, London, United Kingdom>University College London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0523/index.html
2015,A holistic advantage in face drawing: higher accuracy when drawing upright faces,"This study looks into the conception that drawing or copying a face that is vertically inverted will improve the accuracy of the drawing by preventing holistic interference. We had participants draw parameterized face profiles (both upright and inverted) that were sampled from face space (see Davidenko, 2007). In each trial, participants were shown a face on the left side of the screen and asked to copy it on the right side. We then recorded the location of 66 landmark points on each face drawing, allowing us to compute a distance metric between each drawing and its corresponding original face. This distance metric served as a measure of accuracy, with higher distances corresponding to greater errors. Contrary to common belief, people's drawings were significantly more accurate for upright versus inverted faces (t(15) = 4.9; p=0.0002). Our results suggest that holistic processing improves, rather than impairs, the accuracy of face drawing.",>Jennifer Day>Nicolas Davidenko,">UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA, USA>UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0524/index.html

In this naturalistic comparative study, we term this kind of triadic socio-cognitive activity ‘fluid collaboration’. Fluid collaboration occurs when participants establish the pace of ensemble activity mutually, with their moves flexibly adjusted and responsive to one another and to the demands of their shared endeavors. The moves of a fluidly collaborating ensemble depend on each other and might be described as harmonious. This kind of ensemble behavior appears to be the activity of “one organism with many limbs”. Utilizing a micro-analytic qualitative method, our finding of cultural differences in fluid collaboration relates to previous ethnographic and comparative work involving patterns of collaborative activity in Indigenous and Indigenous heritage communities in the Americas.",>Andrew Dayton>Barbara Rogoff,">University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz>University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0525/index.html

Several processes have been proposed for how people control for alternative causes, including probabilistic contrasts within focal sets and associative processes. We investigated another mechanism called the informative transitions heuristic; people selectively attend to temporally adjacent observations (informative transitions; IT) in which the state of the target cause changes but the alternative causes remain the same. Within ITs, whether the effect also changes in the same direction, does not change, or changes in the opposite direction implies that the target cause has a positive, neutral, or negative influence on the effect. Participants judged the strength of the relationship between two drugs and a side effect in a trial-by-trial learning task. Causes with more positive as opposed to neutral ITs were judged to have stronger causal relations, consistent with the IT heuristic.",>Cory Derringer>Benjamin Rottman,">University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0526/index.html

We will report preliminary results from a test of (a) the Somnolent Mentation theory (SMT) of sleep onset (SO) and (b) a new cognitive treatment for insomnia, the cognitive shuffle (CS), derived from the SMT (Beaudoin, 2013, 2014). According to SMT, incoherent mentation characteristic of SO is not merely a side-effect of the SO period but promotes it, meaning it is somnolent. The SMT identifies several types of insomnolent mentation, which involve sense making (e.g., problem solving). SMT postulates counter-insomnolent mentation, thought patterns that interfere with insomnolent mentation. The CS is predicted to be both somnolent and counter-insomnolent (super-somnolent).

2015,Natural language quantifiers are exclusively linked to exact number skills,"Knowledge of natural language quantifiers (like all, some, many) correlates with number acquisition (i.e., counting abilities). At the same time, number acquisition and approximate number skills are closely linked. These findings raise the question whether quantifier comprehension is exclusively related to exact number skills like counting or whether the relationship also extends to approximate number skills. To find out, we tested 3- to 6-year-old German speaking children on a quantifier comprehension task and on two counting tasks (‘how-many task’, ‘give-a-number task’). Additionally, we assessed children’s approximate number skills (ANS acuity) in a non-symbolic number comparison task. Quantifier comprehension was found to correlate with exact number skills even when age was controlled for. However, no significant correlation between quantifier comprehension and ANS acuity was obtained. Our findings support the notion of two distinct number systems: Only exact number skills appear to benefit from quantifier comprehension, whereas approximate number skills do not.",>Sarah Dolscheid,">University of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0528/index.html
2015,Acoustic Correlates of Speaker Confidence: Can They Tell I Don’t Know?,"When nervous, unprepared, or less knowledgeable about a subject area, speakers may become increasingly worried that they are revealing telling acoustic cues about their anxiety level (e.g., hesitation before speaking or vocal jitter) to their audience. The current study is a two-part (production/perception) experiment that sought to evaluate when 1) speakers produce telling acoustics and 2) listeners become sensitive to vocal confidence cues produced by the speaker. The results indicated that when a speaker produced discriminating (un)confidence cues (e.g., rising intonation and delayed speech onset), the listener was significantly better able to predict the speaker’s confidence level. Interestingly, the speaker was significantly more likely to produce discriminating acoustic cues when more social pressure was applied, suggesting that speakers may intentionally communicate information about confidence. This indicates that confidence cues may be produced for the benefit of the listener and not to the detriment of the speaker.",>Krystal Duchi>Alison Kristoff>Schea Fissel>Jennifer Roche,">Kent State University, Kent, Ohio, United States>Kent State University, Kent, Ohio, United States>Kent State University, Kent, Ohio, United States>Kent State University, Kent, Ohio, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0529/index.html
2015,Influences of task difficulty on initiation time and overall use of an external strategy,"Humans readily deploy external strategies in an attempt to offload cognitive work, a process commonly referred to as cognitive offloading. For example, individuals will often rotate their head in an attempt to normalize a rotated display (i.e., external normalization). Previous work has emphasized how various manipulations affect the overall use of the behavior to better understand the underlying decision processes. This approach, however, has overlooked the potential utility in investigating how these manipulations affect the time to initiate the use of strategy. We manipulated task difficulty with upright and rotated displays and measured initiation time and the overall use of external normalization. Analyses demonstrated that when individuals rotate, rotations take the same amount of time to initiate across tasks, whereas overall frequencies of rotations varied as a function of task. This dissociation suggests that the time to initiate the strategy and external strategy selection are at least partly independent.",>Timothy Dunn>Evan Risko,">University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0530/index.html
2015,Body-centric and world-centric components of the large-scale horizontal-vertical illusion,"In the classic horizontal vertical illusion (HVI), vertical lines appear 5-6% longer than horizontal lines. However, in outdoor scenes vertical poles of several meters appear as much as 25% longer than frontal ground extents. This large-scale HVI is consistent with angular scale expansion theory (Durgin & Li, 2011). It is known that the classic HVI is yoked to the reference frame of the eye itself, such that the illusion reverses when the observer is on his or her side. In a series of experiments conducted both in real outdoor spaces and in immersive virtual environments we examined how the large-scale HVI was affected by reorienting the observer, and found that the large scale HVI was reduced, but not reversed. The amount of reduction was quantitatively consistent with a retinotopic contribution of the classical HVI (6%).

In a standard recognition task, subjects study a list of words, and at test, discriminate between studied items (targets) and novel items (foils). To disentangle the contributions of context and item noise, we systematically manipulated both the contexts in which critical items had been encountered prior to study, and the composition of the recognition list, varying semantic similarity among items. Our results suggest independent contributions of each factor, with word frequency and temporal lag as important mediating variables.

We compared the rate of heuristic responding in a control group with that observed in two experimental groups where participants were either explicitly or implicitly primed to reflect on the logic of sets inclusions prior to completing a conjunction probability task. Explicit priming involved asking them to rate a series of statements such as ‘I am more likely to meet a bank teller than a bank teller who is also a feminist.’ Implicit priming involved experiencing a series of events with the co-occurring presence and absence of a target characteristic (e.g., Feminist) and an alternative characteristic (e.g., Bank Teller) using a computer-based dynamic learning task.",>Jenny Faure-Bloom>Gaëlle Vallée-Tourangeau>Frédéric Vallée-Tourangeau,">Kingston University London, Kingston Upon Thames, United Kingdom>Kingston University London, Kingston Upon Thames, United Kingdom>Kingston University London, Kingston Upon Thames, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0534/index.html

They have the potential to reveal emotion and social functions, analogous to facial expression and body gestures in face-to-face verbal communication. Our findings from a corpus study of online text communication by a group of scientists, some of whom were bilingual and others monolingual, suggested that patterns of emoticon use depend on a variety of factors, including emoticon valence and language of texting (Aragon et al., 2014). In the present study we bring these effects into the laboratory by examining the interrelation of emoticons and words in lexical decision (LD) experiments with sequential (SOA 200 ms) but spatially superimposed emoticon-word pairs. Monolingual speakers showed a reliable interaction of emoticon valence with lexicality but interactions with word valence were unreliable.

The Cast-Net model assumes that several stopping rules can be used simultaneously to determine the stopping point to stop information search and to proceed to making a final decision. We analyzed whether the Cast-net model would pay the price for being more complex when compare to single stopping rule models (critical difference, fixed-sample size and runs). The models were compared under different decision making conditions (time pressure and validity of recommendations). The model fitting procedure was conducted on the full data stopping-value distributions, by simultaneously fitting the correct and incorrect responses. Across variety of experimental conditions, the general results supported the validity of the Cast-Net model.

2015,16-month-olds use language to generate expectations about the visual world,"The capacity to use language to form new representations and to revise existing knowledge is a crucial aspect of human cognition. Here we examined whether infants can use language to adjust their existing representation of a recently encoded scene. Using an eye-tracking paradigm, we asked if 16-month-old infants (N = 26; mean age: 16;03, range: 14;15-17;15) use new linguistic information about an occluded event to inform their expectation about what the visual world should look like. We compared looking time to outcomes that matched this information to those that did not. Infants looked significantly longer when the outcome did not match the input, suggesting that they generated an expectation of the outcome based on language alone. This effect was unrelated to infants’ vocabulary size. Thus, using language to form expectations about the visual world is present at an early developmental stage, even when language skills are rudimentary.",>Allison Fitch>Patricia Ganea>Paul Harris>Zsuzsa Kaldy,">University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, United States>University of Toronto>Harvard University>University of Massachusetts Boston",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0537/index.html

The first is open-ended response mining. Narrative responses on a survey are mined for themes then used to develop new questions. Closed-ended responses identify subgroups who agree/disagree with the question. Then open-ended responses examined for systematic differences which suggest new constructs that distinguish the groups. The second is used during question development. Agree/disagree questions are examined for similarity in language using latent semantic analysis. The matrix of similarity coefficients is used to make scale assembly and predicted item performance decisions in advance of field test data. The third involves replacing zero with LSA-derived coefficients as baseline comparisons for correlation coefficients to identify interesting relationships between rating questions. Semantic similarity of question stems suggests a degree of relationship between questions.

Given that wisdom is usually attributed to large crowds, should committees be larger? Using computer simulations and mathematical analyses we show that group accuracy, averaged across the range of difficulty that would be encountered in real-world tasks, is often maximized for moderate-sized groups. The result holds whenever the accuracy in easy tasks is above chance more than the accuracy in difficult tasks is below chance and the easy tasks are encountered more often. Note that for the result to hold, it is not necessary to assume selective sampling of group members according to their individual accuracy.

2015,The effects of spatial anxiety on memory for spatio-temporal scale,"Previous literature has shown that spatial anxiety relates to navigation abilities (Hund & Gill, 2014). How spatial anxiety effects the spatial-temporal perception of one’s environment is not well known. The present student aimed to examine how spatial anxiety related to the memory of distances and time to landmarks in the surrounding area. Participants completed a battery of navigation questionnaires and reported how far (both in distance and time) different known landmarks in the surrounding area were. Data show a trend suggesting that females overestimated distances whereas males were more accurate in estimates to the five furthest landmarks. Spatial anxiety did not predict distance estimates; however, mobility within the surrounding area was marginally predictive of distance estimates for females. These findings suggest that spatial anxiety does not predict the remembered distances and time estimates to landmarks, but that mobility may be a more important predictive factor in remembered distances to landmarks.",>Devin Gill>Jeanine Stefanucci>Sarah Creem-Regehr>Erica Barhorst,">University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0541/index.html
2015,Analogical reasoning performance and organization is influenced by the type of semantic distractors: an investigation with adults,"The way participants adapt their search to the specifics of different types of analogies is not fully understood. We compared the effects of two types of semantic distractors. The first were related to C by a semantic relation which had nothing to do with the semantic relation used in the A:B pairs, whereas the second, the so-called ""double distractors"", were not only related to C but also had a semantic relation similar to the one linking A to B. We used eye-tracking measurements in addition to reaction time and performance indices. We found that performance decreased, and that the solution set was less explored visually with the double distractors than with the former. This suggests that the analysis of the A:B pair activates a set of relations which can prime irrelevant relations which compete with other relations while searching for the relevant dimensions.",>Yannick Glady>Bob French>Jean-Pierre Thibaut,">CNRS, Dijon, France>LEAD-CNRS, U. of Burgundy>LEAD-CNRS, U. of Burgundy",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0542/index.html
2015,"Individual Differences, Confirmation, and the Consideration of Alternative Causes","In causal inference, people place greatest weight on cases where a hypothesized cause and its outcome are simultaneously present, potentially reflecting a positive test or confirmatory strategy. We hypothesized that individuals may display more confirmation seeking when an outcome has few, versus many, causal alternatives and that this relation may vary with actively open-minded thinking (AOT) or need for cognition (NFC). Subjects learned about implausible or plausible causes of outcomes that had many or few causal alternatives (e.g., stress vs. colon cancer). On each of 16 trials, subjects received frequency data and made a causal judgment, after which they completed the AOT and NFC scales. As hypothesized, subjects weighted confirming data more heavily with fewer vs. many causal alternatives, but this relationship only held for plausible causes. AOT interacted with causal alternatives: With few alternatives, AOT was unrelated to data-weighting. However, with many alternatives, data-weighting increased with increases in AOT.",>Kelly Goedert>Michelle Ellefson>Victoria Kerns,>Seton Hall University>University of Cambridge>Seton Hall University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0543/index.html
2015,The Increased Use of Tablets In Education: Why Physical Learning Is Sometimes Better,"Digital devices are becoming ubiquitous fixtures in classrooms nationwide. Despite this, the costs and benefits of digitization are understudied. For example, Mangen et al. (2013) found advantages in reading with physical books compared to digital readers. The current study extends these findings to physical and digital versions of spatial puzzles. Participants completing a series of physical tangram puzzles were both faster and more accurate than those completing digital versions of identical puzzles on tablet computers. Those in the physical condition were also faster and less error-prone on a subsequent arithmetic test. These results suggest that the current trend of increased digitization in education may have far-reaching and unexpected implications that could compromise learning. Follow-up studies aim to identify the cognitive mechanisms that cause these differences. These findings can be used to develop a set of best practices for incorporating digital teaching tools in the classroom.",>Sara Goodman>Travis Seymour>Barrett Anderson,>University of California Santa Cruz>University of California Santa Cruz>University of California Santa Cruz,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0544/index.html
2015,Exploring the mechanism of context-dependent memory,"Many experiments within the memory literature show evidence for context-dependent effects in memory (Gieselman & Bjork, 1980; Godden & Baddeley, 1980; Marian & Neisser, 2000; Smith, 1986; Smith & Vela, 2001). There have also been a number of failed replications of this effect (Farnsworth, 1930; Reed, 1931; Smith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978; Godden & Baddeley, 1980; Jacoby, 1983). If the context-dependent effect exists, there are many unanswered questions about it, such as the mechanism behind the phenomenon and at what level of detail context is encoded. In order to explore these questions, we need a reliable way of observing context-dependence that holds across experiments. Here we attempt to find a paradigm that can be reliably used to elicit context-dependence, so that we can begin answering some of these questions.",>Chelsea Gordon>Michael Spivey,">University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, United States>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0545/index.html
2015,Economic Behavioral and Semantic Analysis of Generosity and Fairness in L’Arche Caregivers,"Persistent virtue requires commitment to values not easily operationalized in the metrics of cognitive science. Caregivers living in L’Arche communities commit years and decades of their lives to compassion and social justice in caring for unrelated developmentally disabled adults. We examine generosity and fairness among 48 L’Arche caregivers using economic behavioral tasks and life and identity narrative interviews. Analysis of forced dictator economic behavioral tasks found heterogeneity in generosity and in approaches to fairness utilizing economic equity and efficiency. Latent semantic analysis of transcribed interviews showed a significant difference between probes measuring just, brave, caring, and interpersonal generosity characteristics for all participants. The integrative analysis of economic behavioral tasks and semantic analyses of life and identity narrative interviews illuminates challenges in using laboratory methods to examine qualities of exemplary virtue and demonstrates the fruitfulness of examining exemplars of caring for insight into moral cognition.",>Mark Graves>Kevin Reimer>Andrea Beckum>Shaina Smith>Remya Nair>Michael Spezio>Warren Brown>Steven Quartz,">Fuller Theological Seminary; California Institute of Technology>University of California, Irvine>Fuller Theological Seminary>Fuller Theological Seminary>California Institute of Technology>Scripps College, Claremont; California Institute of Technology; University of Hamburg Medical Center>Fuller Theological Seminary>California Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0546/index.html
2015,Do infants compare ratios or use simpler heuristics in probabilistic inference?,"Empirical evidence suggests infants can make inferences about uncertain future events using probabilistic data (Denison & Xu, 2010; Teglas et al., 2007). However, it is unclear if infants are using information about proportions to make these decisions. Infants were presented with population jars that contained large distributions of objects, and were tasked with deciding which of the two jars was more likely to yield a desirable object on a single draw. In Experiment 1, most infants chose the jar that contained only preferred objects over a jar that contained a 3:1 ratio of preferred objects. Most infants also made the correct choice when presented with the reverse ratios (choosing a 1:3 over a 0:1 ratio). In Experiment 2, infants correctly chose the jar that contained a 4:1 ratio of preferred objects over a jar that contained a 1.5:1 ratio.

In this study, we compared three types of UI, an embodied agent system equipped with a direct anthropomorphization robot, an only voice agent, and without agent system condition, of a microwave oven. Thirty-six older (65 years or above) and 36 younger adults (undergraduate students) participated in the usability testing experiment with one of the three agent conditions. Analysis of interaction between a participant and the oven, through participants' utterance and the personal-space data, showed large differences between two age groups; younger adults entertained the interaction both the voice and the embodiment agent conditions, while older adults evaluated higher only with the embodiment agent condition.

Products' information was manipulated on scale and order dimension. Participants made a decision on three situations choosing music(mp3) download plan, cell phone data plan, drinks voucher plan for a coffee shop as well. All stimuli were appeared through the computer monitor in laboratory. Preference and purchase intention were measured by 7 likert scale on two kinds of plans presented in two different scales. Findings show that consumers had more preference and purchase intention when the product's information was displayed on an expanded scale than on a contracted scale. Unfortunately the displaying order didn't have any significant impact on preference of products. However, effect of an order on preference appeared differently depending on the product type.

2015,Social Influences on the Spatial Perspective-Taking Abilities of Males and Females,"Female performance on tests of spatial ability may be hindered by the presence of stereotype threat. We examined sex differences in performance on two perspective taking tests when these tests were framed as measuring either spatial or social (empathy) abilities. In the spatial condition, the tasks were framed as spatial and participants were reminded of the male advantage on some spatial tasks. The social condition included modified versions of the tasks to include avatars of human figures, and framed the tasks as social tasks with a female advantage. Results showed a gender difference in favor of males in the spatial condition, but not in the social condition. Framing did not affect male performance. However, females in the social condition outperformed females in the spatial condition. These results suggest that females may underperform on spatial tests in part because of negative performance expectations rather than their actual spatial abilities.",>Nahal Heydari>Mary Hegarty>Margaret Tarampi,">University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California, Santa Barbara>SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind, University of California Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0550/index.html

We showed twelve- and thirty-month-old children videos of conversation featuring puppets using typical (200ms inter-turn silence) and atypical (1200ms silence and 3+ syllables vocal overlap) turn-timing. We assessed children’s timing preferences by then showing them the two puppets (typical and atypical) for a sustained period and then by asking them to choose one puppet to hold. Preliminary results suggest that, overall, children were more likely to discriminate between typical and atypical timing for vocal overlap than long silent gaps. This maps nicely onto findings about children’s spontaneous turn-taking: they learn to minimize overlaps before gaps.",>Elma E. Hilbrink>Marisa Casillas>Imme L. Lammertink>Stephen C.

We examined which components of this underlining strategy could facilitate comprehension. The effects on comprehension of lined traces and hand movement were examined independently. Eighty-two undergraduates were assigned to one of the four conditions: both traces and movement, movement and no trace, traces and no movement, and neither trace nor movement. After reading the expository text as instructed for ten minutes, participants were instructed to solve a Sudoku puzzle as a distracter task for three minutes. They were then asked to summarize, title, and generate three keywords for the text in ten minutes. The results showed that hand movement facilitated appropriate summarization and that lined traces enhanced appropriate titling.

2015,The influence of an inherence heuristic on scientific explanation,"What cognitive processes underlie scientific explanation? Although scientific reasoning is often careful and methodical, we hypothesize that it is also influenced by an intuitive explanatory process: namely, an inherence heuristic (Cimpian & Salomon, 2014, BBS). The central claim of the inherence heuristic proposal is that, when people construct explanations, they oversample inherent facts about the entities whose behavior they are attempting to explain. We investigated the influence of this heuristic process on explanations for novel and historical scientific phenomena in chemistry, biology, and physics. Participants were provided with short vignettes describing unexpected outcomes of experiments and were asked to explain these outcomes. As predicted, explanations were couched primarily in terms of inherent features of the entities involved. Importantly, this was so even though such features were not mentioned in the vignettes but extrinsic factors were (e.g., high altitude, unusual location). These findings elucidate the psychological processes that underlie scientific explanation.",>Zachary Horne>Andrei Cimpian,">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States of America>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0553/index.html

The purpose of the study is to explore the link between empathy and humor use in teenagers and to investigate if gender differences exist as well. 115 adolescents between 11-12 years old participated the study and filled out The Empathy Quotient and Taiwanese Adolescent Humor Instruments. We found that empathy and the sense of humor had a significant correlation both in boys and girls. However, the scenarios of humor using and the purposes of humor using only had a positive correlation with empathy in girls. The findings offer a supplementary evidence for the developmental link between empathy and humor.

2015,The Relationship between Theory of Mind Abilities and Humor Comprehension,"According to Howe (2002), humor originates from perceiving the thoughts of the subject of the humor, implying the involvement of perspective-taking or related mental processes. However, how does the ability to infer the mental states of others, or theory of mind (ToM) operate with the comprehension of humor is yet certain. The current research continued to examine this idea using fMRI, hoping to investigate the underlying neural substrates of those with high and low ToM related ability when processing humor. In fMRI, participants read 64 stories, including ToM-funny, ToM-unfunny, nonsensical-funny, and nonsensical-unfunny conditions. Empathy Quotient is used to assess participants’ ToM ability. The results revealed a positive correlation between EQ scores and left ACC under the comparison between ToM conditions and nonsensical conditions.

The National Hurricane Center displays hurricane forecasts using a track forecast cone, depicting the expected track of the storm and the uncertainty in the forecast. Our goal was to test whether different graphical displays of a hurricane forecast containing uncertainty would influence a decision about storm characteristics. Participants viewed one of five different visualization types.

2015,The Color of Music: Synesthesia or emotion-mediated cross-modal associations?,"The cross-modal literature posits a weak-to-strong continuum of synesthesia. One extreme views cross-modal associations as idiosyncratic and unique to synesthetes. The other extreme suggests that cross-modal associations follow a general pattern across individuals, and are mediated by emotional associations. We tested these views by examining differences between music-color synesthetes and non-synesthetes in their consistency of color associations and memory for music. We find that music-color associations follow the same general pattern across these groups. A two-dimensional mapping is found to mode (major/minor) and tempo. Slow-minor music (thought to convey sadness) is associated with blue, fast-minor with red (anger), fast-major with yellow (happiness), and slow-major with green (calmness). Both groups are consistent in their associations over time, and synesthesia has no effect on memory. We conclude that music-color synesthesia may be an extension of normal psychological processes that govern cross-modal associations, with individuals aligning music and color based on emotional congruence.",>Erin Isbilen>Carol Lynne Krumhansl,">Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States>Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0557/index.html

Focusing on attitudes and behaviors in appreciation and creation as mediating variables, it was hypothesized that (a) the method of appreciation with comparison between one’s creations and others’ creations is the best predictor of artistic inspiration, and (b) art experiences might affect artistic inspiration, meditated by competence in artistic creation and the method of art appreciation. A total of 185 Japanese undergraduate and graduate students completed the research questionnaire. Data was analyzed using multiple linear regression for the first hypothesis and structural equation modeling for the second hypothesis. The two hypotheses were supported.

2015,Effect of language on discrimination between warm and cold color hues.,"It has been argued that linguistic color categories, despite their number can vary between languages, are themselves universal and based on physiologically conditioned distinctions. Recently it has been demonstrated that Russians, whose language has separate terms for light and dark blue, discriminate faster between objects of corresponding hues than Englishmen. In our study we tested if language also conditions the physiologically more sound discrimination between cold and warm hues. We compare Russians to speakers of Komi language, where green and yellow make up the same category and there is only one category for blue. Russians outperformed Komi in discriminating between light and dark blue objects as well as yellow and green objects. However Komi were faster in discriminating yellow and green objects then light and dark blue objects. Therefore, language influences discrimination between warm and cold hues, but this impact is weaker than in the case of two cold hues.",>Kirill Istomin>Irina Ilina>Oleg Uliashev,">Institute of Language, Literature and History, Komi Science Center, Russian Academy of Science, Syktyvkar, Russia>Institute of Language, Literature and History, Komi Science Center, Russian Academy of Science, Syktyvkar, Russia>Institute of Language, Literature and History, Komi Science Center, Russian Academy of Science, Syktyvkar, Russia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0559/index.html
2015,The specificity of the labeling effect on memory: what kinds of labels improve retrieval?,"Relational retrieval—retrieval that is based on common relational structure, such as an underlying principle or pattern, is typically rare. Previously, we found that providing relational labels at encoding and/or test can improve relational retrieval (Jamrozik & Gentner, 2013). In the current work, we tested the specificity of the labeling effect by comparing the effects of relational labels (e.g., inoculation) with domain labels (e.g., psychology). Because people are naturally likely to attend to domain information, we predicted that domain labels would have a smaller effect on domain retrieval. Using a cued-recall paradigm, we varied the presence of relational and domain labels at encoding and test. Relational labels increased relational retrieval, but domain labels had no effect on domain retrieval. These results suggest that relational labels have a strong effect on retrieval (relative to other kinds of labels) since they increase people’s attention to information that is not naturally salient.",>Anja Jamrozik>Dedre Gentner,>University of Pennsylvania>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0560/index.html
2015,Dogmas of Understanding in Western Art Music Performance,"This paper presents an exploration of the ontological shift from musical materials (i.e. melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, timbre, register) to activities in music performance analysis. The “dogmas” extend Herbert H. Clark’s conceptual framework for the study of joint activity in language use to explore music performance in the WAM tradition. A systematic analysis of London Symphony Orchestra masterclasses examines the basic mechanisms of music making in four main areas: representation, audience, interaction, and tacit knowledge. This exploration leads to a broader account of cognition and creativity in music performance, one that bridges inner and outer processes of awareness around domains of coordination in joint activities. In this view, material conceptualizations are viewed as targets of focal awareness rather than the basis for cognition in music making. This account, grounded in a rich third-person phenomenological analysis of instructional materials, paves the way for a “meaningful analytics” of musical practice.",>Linda T.

We hypothesized an intrinsic link between the ability to update beliefs given evidence and the ability to ask informative questions. To study the developmental trajectory of this behavior, five to ten-year-old children played an iPad game asking them to identify a hidden bug. Learners could either ask about individual bugs, or make a series of feature queries (e.g., “Does the hidden bug have antenna?”) that more efficiently narrow the hypothesis space. The iPad display either assisted children with updating their beliefs or required them to update themselves. We analyze the relationship between belief updating and information seeking behavior as a function of age, along with how their strategies for acquiring information change. The broader context of the work is to better understand how to structure informal science exhibits in ways that are developmentally appropriate.",>George Kachergis>Marjorie Rhodes>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0562/index.html

Compound words are widely accepted to be stored in the lexicon but their constituents need to be accessed during both language learning and production processes. In this study, the use of corpora was investigated for how to differentiate single-stem words from single-word compounds and then how to segment compound words when no phonological information is available. Stems and morphs discovered in manual segmentations of the METU-Sabancı Turkish Treebank and the CHILDES were employed in the compound word recognition task and the results were compared. The METU Turkish Corpus (with about 2 million words) and a web-corpus (with about 490 million of Turkish words) were utilized in the segmentation task. The results emphasize that the lexicon can be morpheme-based; and lexical frequencies are effective heuristics in compound word recognition and segmentation.",>Ozkan Kilic,>Graduate Student,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0563/index.html

NARS is an artificial general intelligence system designed under the assumption that the system usually has insufficient knowledge and resources with respect to the problems to be solved, and must adapt to its environment. Since the human mind was evolved under the same restriction, this normative model shows many human-like properties. In this paper, NARS is used to reinterpret several well-known results in cognitive science, such as Wason’s selection task, the Linda problem, and U-shaped learning. These results cannot be explained by traditional normative models, while now they can be handled by NARS in a unified way.",>Ozkan Kilic>Pei Wang,>Temple University>Temple University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0564/index.html
2015,Social categories as ‘excluders’: Explaining stereotyping with connectionist modeling,"A central idea in social psychology is that people can construe other people in terms of two types of mental representations: social categories (e.g. male) and attributes (e.g. intelligent). It is assumed that assigning a person to a social category (i.e. social categorization) is one of the most important causes of stereotyping. However, no theory has yet successfully explicated the properties that distinguish social categories from attributes and how those distinct properties may cause stereotyping. We show that an interpretation of social categories as mental representations that strongly exclude other mental representations (i.e. 'excluders') can explain how social categories may cause stereotyping. In addition, we present computer simulations that implement the assumed principles in a connectionist model where social categories are interpreted as nodes with strong inhibitory links. We argue that our model solves fundamental ambiguities in social categorization theories and unifies these theories with connectionist models of person perception.",>Andre Klapper>Ron Dotsch>Iris van Rooij>Daniel Wigboldus,">Radboud University Nijmegen, Behavioural Science Institute>Utrecht University &  Radboud University Nijmegen, Behavioural Science Institute>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Behavioural Science Institute",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0565/index.html

2015,Using Real-Time Computational Modeling to Individually Optimize Speech Category Learning,"Acquiring novel speech categories is necessary in spoken language learning. The dual-learning systems (DLS) approach posits that two competitive systems underlie the category learning process: an explicit hypothesis-testing system, and an implicit procedural system. DLS assumes that the explicit system dominates early and control is passed to the implicit system when optimal. Evidence from our work, including the finding that minimally informative feedback enhances speech learning relative to fully informative feedback, supports the claim that the implicit system optimally mediates speech learning in adulthood. Experiment 1 replicates this finding. Experiment 2 tests the DLS prediction that explicit processing dominates early by comparing performance across two conditions. The optimal condition includes full feedback early and minimal feedback later. The suboptimal condition includes minimal feedback early and full feedback later. In both conditions, real-time computational modeling individualized when feedback transitions occurred.

Two experiments, consisting of 59 Japanese university students was conducted using two regular and two honorific Japanese verbs in sentences where participants’ literal or metaphorical interpretation of the verbs was measured by their vertical or horizontal hand movement.

2015,Finding Meaning in Neuroaesthetics,"How might neuroaesthetics move beyond beauty and begin to study meaning? While neuroaesthetics is broadly concerned with the brain’s role in processing art, it has typically focused on perceptual preferences concerning the question of beauty. To cut deeper ontologically the field might consider exploring other basic kinds of meaningful categorical judgments people routinely make about artifacts, including those related to an object’s purpose and status as art. Providing a point of entry for an empirical approach, a methodology is described where participants judge objects (chairs) for higher-order qualities beyond beauty, including functionality, and art-objecthood. Results suggest that artifacts can be used for probing deeper empirical questions concerning the neural basis for aesthetic judgments and object processing.

2015,A Case-Based Reasoning Approach to Providing High-Quality Feedback on Computer Programming Exercises,"Automated assessment and immediate feedback are staple features of modern e-learning systems. In the case of programming exercises, most systems only provide binary (correct/incorrect) feedback, which is often inadequate for students struggling with the material, as they may need expert guidance in order to successfully overcome obstacles to understanding. We propose a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach to improve the quality of feedback on programming exercises. CBR is a machine learning technique that solves problems based on previous experiences (cases). Every time the instructor provides feedback to a student on a particular exercise, the information is stored in a database as a past case. When students experience similar problems in the future, knowledge contained in past cases is used to guide the students to a solution. While the system will provide detailed feedback automatically, this feedback will have been previously crafted by human instructors, leveraging their pedagogical expertise.",>Angelo Kyrilov>David Noelle,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0570/index.html
2015,Linear Versus Non-Linear Policy Capturing in a Dynamic Classification Task,Policy capturing is a decision analysis technique normally using linear statistical models to infer the basis of expert judgments. The purpose of the present work was to test if the C4.5 decision tree (DT) algorithm (a non-linear machine learning method) is more effective at capturing individual’s decision policies than the standard linear technique. Human classification behavior was measured in a simulated naval air-defence task to compare decision tree models and linear logistic regression models in terms of their descriptive and predictive accuracy. Results show that C4.5 was superior in terms of goodness-of-fit and cross-validation performance. Decision tree complexity was significantly correlated to individuals’ response times. The classification rules derived from each individual were actually more reliable than their human counterparts – replicating a classic finding in policy capturing. We conclude that C4.5 is a useful policy capturing tool in the context of a complex dynamic task environment.,>Daniel Lafond>Benoit Roberge-Valliere>Marie-Eve Saint-Louis>Sebastien Tremblay,>Thales Research Technology Canada>U Laval>U Laval>U Laval,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0571/index.html
2015,The Effects of Worked Examples on Transfer of Statistical Reasoning,"Research suggests that guided methods of instruction, such as worked examples, reduce the cognitive load placed on learners, which allows them to learn new information more efficiently and effectively. The current study examined the effect of worked examples on transfer of statistical reasoning, as compared to traditional study techniques. Students from an introductory college-level psychology course learned information related to basic statistics and hypothesis testing from a computerized instructional program. The experimental group completed a computerized program which contained worked examples and practice and feedback. The control group consisted of students who went through a computer program through which they read excerpts from a textbook used in Queens College statistical reasoning classes. The same topics were covered in both computerized programs. On posttests, the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group. This provides support for computerized worked examples as effective instruction on the college level.",>Marianna Lamnina>Daniel Fienup,">Columbia University, New York, New York, United States>CUNY Graduate Center",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0572/index.html
2015,The colors and textures of musical sounds,"Music-to-color associations show emotionally-mediated cross-modal correspondences (Palmer et al., 2013): people choose colors as going best with music when their emotional content matches (e.g., happy-looking colors go best with happy-sounding music). What musical/acoustic features underlie such correspondences? And are music-to-texture correspondences also evident? Experiments using highly-controlled melodies that varied in tonality (major/minor), note-rate (fast/medium/slow), and register (high/low) revealed systematic correspondences between musical/acoustic and colorimetric dimensions: faster, major, higher-pitched melodies were associated with more saturated, lighter, yellower colors, whereas slower, minor, lower-pitched melodies were associated with more muted, darker, bluer colors. Further experiments revealed emotion-mediated associations from music to texture, although agitated/calm and angry/not-angry emotions were stronger with textures, whereas happy/sad emotions were stronger with colors. Systematic associations were also evident between visual/spatial features of texture (e.g., Sharp/Smooth, Curved/Straight) and musical dimensions (e.g., note-rate and piano/cello timbre).",>Thomas Langlois>Joshua Peterson>Stephen Palmer,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0573/index.html
2015,"""No way!"": Similar contribution of visual and auditory cues to sarcasm comprehension","While conversationally common, sarcasm presents identification challenges in writing. For example, ""Oh wow!"" may be expressed both sincerely and ironically. Research suggests that interpretation of ambiguous sarcasm may be context dependent, though precisely how visual and auditory cues contribute to comprehension remains unclear. To explore this, we recorded an actor performing 45 phrases sarcastically and sincerely. In two calibration studies, we selected 16 ambiguous phrases that were identifiable with all cues available. In the main study, participants classified these phrases as sarcastic or sincere in three conditions: audio-video (N=32), audio-only (N=29), or video-only (N=26). Performance was high (91%) with both cues available. Intriguingly, the drops in performance with audio only (82%, p<.001) and video only (80%, p<.0001) were small and not significantly different from one another (p>.5) suggesting auditory and visual cues contribute similarly to sarcasm comprehension. We replicated these results in a separate within-subjects experiment (N=77).",>Alina Larson>John Collins>Nicolas Davidenko,>UC Santa Cruz>UC Santa Cruz>UC Santa Cruz,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0574/index.html
2015,Semantic Richness Effects in Memory,"The semantic richness of a word is multidimensional, and includes dimensions such as semantic neighborhood density, imageability, number of features, and valence. While certain dimensions (e.g., imageability) have been examined in the memory domain, the bulk of semantic richness research has been confined to visual word recognition tasks. Therefore, it is unclear if other dimensions influence memory and in what manner. Our aim was to extend previous works by investigating the relative contributions of these dimensions in memory using the megastudy approach. This approach allows the language to define the stimuli, rather than have the experimenter select stimuli based on a limited set of criteria. 120 participants studied 532 words and they had to either recall or recognize these words. We found that although semantically richer words were generally more memorable, this did not generalize to all dimensions. The implications of these findings will be discussed.",>Mabel Lau>Winston Goh>Melvin Yap,>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0575/index.html
2015,Long-Term Memory and Working Memory can be Improved by Cognitive Training,"Previous research showed improved working memory through cognitive training. However, comparatively little is known about whether long-term memory can be improved by training. Several cognitive processes, including working memory and executive function, subsume long-term memory functioning. Thus, if the cognitive processes that subserve long-term memory could be improved via training, we predicted that it should lead to broad improvements in long-term memory. The current study examined whether training using three different cognitive training conditions would improve performance in tasks measuring executive functions and long-term memory. Participants were assigned one of three possible training conditions (working memory training, mindfulness training, and retrieval practice) over 20 days. Results suggested that retrieval practice and mindfulness led to changes that improve participants' ability to store and retrieve new episodic information formed while reading text passages. Other benefits include improvements in working memory and executive functions. Limitations and directions for future research will be discussed.",>David>Michael,>Nanyang Technological University>Nanyang Technological University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0576/index.html
2015,Vocabulary Size is Correlated with Non-Native Tone Sensitivity In English Learning Infants,"In many languages, tone (i.e., pitch patterns) is part of the phonological system; two words with the same sequences of segments can differ only in tone. Tone does not distinguish word meanings in English, so English-learning infants can ignore tone when learning words, but do they? We examined the encoding of tonal detail in word learning by monolingual English-learning 14- and 17-month-olds. Infants were habituated to a novel word with a Mandarin tone (/ká/) paired with a novel object. Test trials alternated between the same pairing (Same), and the same object paired with the word with a different tone (/kà/, Switch). Longer looks to the unfamiliar mapping indicate infants noticed the switch and attended to tone contrasts. Overall, neither age group discriminated the tone contrast; however, infants with larger vocabularies looked longer to the novel mapping (r=.32, p=.007), suggesting a common underlying mechanism between general word learning and tone sensitivity.",>Candise Lin>Toben Mintz,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0577/index.html
2015,The Cognitive Niches of Knowledge-Based Decision Strategies,"Within the fast-and-frugal heuristics framework several strategies have been proposed to describe how people infer unknown criteria from knowledge stored in memory. An open question is how people select between the set of available strategies. We build upon previous work that maps environmental structures into mental representations to carve out for each strategy a cognitive niche, or area of applicability. Based on patterns of occurrences and co-occurrences of objects and facts in the internet, we predict the probability and latency of retrieval of factual knowledge about these objects. This allows us to simulate the applicability of different knowledge-based strategies as a function of the distribution of decision relevant information in the environment. We conclude that the problem of strategy selection might be restricted when the pattern of information occurrence in the environment and the resulting accessibility of knowledge about the decision objects in memory are accounted for.",>Daniela Link>Julian Marewski,>University of Lausanne>University of Lausanne,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0578/index.html
2015,"Belief in the unbelievable: The relationship between tendencies to believe pseudoscience, paranormal, and conspiracy theories","This research investigated how pseudoscientific, paranormal, and conspiracy beliefs relate to each other. Preliminary research indicates that holding one type of unsubstantiated belief predicts holding other types of belief (Lobato et al., 2014). We administered a survey (n=420) asking about belief in specific pseudoscientific, paranormal, and conspiracy claims. We also examined cognitive predispositions towards analytical and intuitive thinking, open-minded thinking, and ontological knowledge. Pseudoscientific beliefs were predicted by beliefs about paranormal and conspiracy claims; paranormal beliefs were predicted by beliefs about pseudoscientific and conspiracy claims; and conspiracy beliefs were predicted by beliefs about pseudoscientific and paranormal claims. Other individual difference variables were minimally predictive of each kind of belief. However, individuals predisposed towards intuitive thinking and who made ontological confusions were more likely to endorse paranormal and conspiracy claims. These results partially replicate Lobato et al.

2015,Modern Symbolic Communication Through Non-Word Text,"Emoticons are graphic signs, such as :-)(smiley face), that often accompany textual computer-mediated communication (Dresner & Herring, 2010). Emoticons are thought to be used to convey emotion (Derks et al, 2007; Wolf, 2000). Specifically, it is believed that emoticons supplement electronic communication with non-verbal cues, such as those often seen in face-to-face communication (Lo, 2008). We collected text messages from participants who also rated the messages across a number of emotional dimensions. We asked a separate group to rate the same messages on the same dimensions. By comparing when a particular emoticon was used, the emotional qualities of the message as rated by both the sender and reviewer, we aim to investigate which emoticon is likely to be included in text messages according to emotional intent, and whether this emotional intent will likely be understood.",>Milagros Florentina Lopez Obeso>Morgan Magnus Fleming,">University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, United States>University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0580/index.html
2015,P3 as a neural index of response inhibition,"This study aimed to identify which ERP are specifically related to response inhibition. Electrophysiological activity was recorded from 30 subjects, and was submitted to a temporospatial principal component analysis to detect and quantify the main components associated with response inhibition. A modified go/nogo composed of three types of stimuli (frequentGo, infrequentGo, and infrequentNogo) was used to dissociate activity related to response inhibition from that related to novelty processing. InfrequentGo and infrequentNogo trials differed in the type of response (execution vs. inhibition), but not in their frequency of appearance. Neither the anterior nor the posterior N2 displayed larger amplitudes for infrequentNogo than infrequentGo trials. By contrast, both the anterior and the posterior P3 showed larger amplitudes for infrequentNogo than for infrequentGo trials. Present results suggest that P3 plays a key role in motor response inhibition.

2015,Topological Relations between Objects Are Categorically Coded,"The visual system, like the brain more broadly, relies heavily on categorical representations. It is easier to spot a visual difference that crosses a category boundary, e.g., between blue and green, or between vertical and oblique. Here we show that topological relations between objects are similarly categorical. When asked to detect changes between object arrangements, participants were better at detecting those changes that crossed hypothesized category boundaries, such as 'overlapping', or 'touching', compared to equally-sized changes that did not. These effects were magnified at increased memory load, presumably because this categorization forms a more efficient code. This finding, consistent with previous computational modeling work, suggests that categorical relations are critical for remembering and comparing complex images.",>Andrew Lovett>Steve Franconeri,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0582/index.html

Therefore, this study explored a new way in helping elementary children understand abstract science concepts using embodiment, or physically moving their own bodies. Students engaged in activities that helped them learn about abstract science concepts by physically performing tasks related to these science concepts. The purpose of this study was to examine the importance and role of embodiment in students’ understanding and motivation in elementary science learning.

2015,Inferring causal structure and hidden causes from event sequences,"Past research has shown that people use temporal information to detect and discriminate between different causal relationships and that timing-based causal inferences are modulated by explicit information and domain-appropriate expectations. Many of these past results suggest that learners make inferences about hidden causes from timing information, but there have been no systematic studies of the ways in which subtle changes in temporal information can shape inferences about the presence and nature of hidden causes. We present new results showing that people make nuanced causal inferences when faced with streams of events, using temporal information to infer the presence of simple generative relationships, independent and common hidden causes, and causal cycles. Interpreted in a Bayesian framework, these results shed light on the cues and tacit temporal expectations that people use to make efficient use of temporal information.",>Christopher Lucas>Kenneth Holstein>Michael Pacer,">University of Edinburgh>Carnegie Mellon University>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0584/index.html

Different from probabilistic, fuzzy and weighted approaches, this framework considers the strength of arguments and attacks from two aspects: the inner structure of arguments and the beliefs of agents. A key concept in this framework is the notion of satisfiability degree, which is used to define the intrinsic strength of attacks and the extrinsic strength of arguments. These two kinds of strengths are combined into the degree of attack/support. Then, new semantics of this framework are defined and the relation with Dung's approach is discussed.",>Jian Luo>Fuan Pu>Guiming Luo,">School of Software, Tsinghua University, Haidian District, Beijing, China>School of Software, Tsinghua University, Haidian District, Beijing, China>School of Software, Tsinghua University, Haidian District, Beijing, China",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0585/index.html

In Experiment 1, 24 participants read events presented in cause-to-effect or effect-to-cause order without causal conjunctions. The latter received longer reading times and more regressions than the former even when probability and predictability were balanced. Experiment 2 examined whether this reading order effect was derived from a default reasoning asymmetry (i.e., reasoning from cause to effect is favored over that from effect to cause). We utilized epistemic constructions to explicitly identify the reasoning direction. Self-paced reading results from 24 participants showed that readers were more efficient when reading cause-event as the evidence, effect-event as the conclusion vis-a-vis the counterpart, confirming the reasoning asymmetry. However, reading order effect remained robust, presumably reflecting that causal reasoning is temporally embodied.",>Yingyi Luo>Manami Sato>Yunzhu Wang>Satoshi Ito>Hiromu Sakai,">Waseda University, Tokyo, JAPAN>Okinawa International University, Ginowan, Okinawa, JAPAN>Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima, JAPAN>Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima, JAPAN>Waseda University, Tokyo, JAPAN",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0586/index.html

Recently, Nakamura et al. (2014) indicated that physical coldness reduced empathic concern and facilitated utilitarian judgment in personal moral dilemma. It is also shown that tactile sensations such as softness and hardness affect our social judgment and empathic feeling to others. In this experiment, participants palmed either a soft cotton cushion or a hard iron tube while making moral judgments. Results showed that the hardness did not solely facilitate utilitarian judgment, however sex-tactile sensations interaction was modestly significant in personal dilemma. Specifically, males seemed to be more utilitarian while palming the iron tube. Results also showed that males were more utilitarian when they felt the sacrificed individuals were socially distant. Furthermore, contrary to expectation, high empathic feelings strengthened utilitarian judgment.",>Yoshimasa Majima>Hiroko Nakamura,">Hokusei Gakuen University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, JAPAN>Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0587/index.html
2015,Neural precursors of decisions that matter – an ERP study of the role of consciousness in deliberate and random choices,"Neural precursors of voluntary actions appear before subjects report having decided on their behavior, leading some to dismiss a causal role for consciousness in decision-making. But the voluntary actions studied are typically arbitrary – bearing no purpose, meaning or consequence. We used EEG to directly compare deliberate and arbitrary decisions in a donation-preference task. Two NPOs appeared on the left/right of the screen, and subjects pressed the left/right button with the corresponding hand. In the deliberate condition, subjects’ choices led to monetary donations to the NPOs. In the arbitrary condition, both NPOs received donations irrespective of the choice. Early left/right ERP differences appeared ~1s before the action only for arbitrary decisions. Following our earlier work, we interpreted these ERPs as reflecting random bias activity disjoint from decision-making processes. Our findings challenge previous studies, suggesting that early predictability of voluntary action does not generalize from arbitrary to more-interesting deliberate decisions.",>Uri Maoz>Liad Mudrik>Ram Rivlin>Gideon Yaffe>Ralph Adolphs>Christof Koch,">California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA>Tel Aviv University>Hebrew University of Jerusalem>Yale University>California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA>Allen Institute for Brain Science",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0588/index.html

Discpline-based education research (DBER) acknowledges similarities in learners’ cognitive architecture that allow interventions to transfer among domains, but it also argues that each domain has characteristics that might affect how interventions impact learning. The present study uses an instructional design technique that had previously improved learners’ problem solving performance in programming: subgoal labeled procedural instructions and worked examples. The present study explores the effect of this technique for solving problems in statistics and chemistry. The problem solving procedures in the three domains have different characteristics. Similarly, each of the three experiments has a different pattern of results for problem solving performance. This study concludes that subgoal labeled worked examples seem to be equally effective across the different domains.

Undergraduates’ beliefs about where a coin falls when dropped by someone walking were assessed. A common misconception is that a coin will fall straight down, but its forward motion actually continues before it hits the ground. 135 students who expressed this misconception read one of three passages about the issue. The passages differed in whether the misconception was explicitly stated, only implied, or not mentioned at all. Past research shows that calling a misconception to the foreground helps people overcome the misconception (Broughton & Sinatra, 2010). We found a significant difference across conditions, with 86% of those who saw the explicit misconception, 72% of those who saw the implicit reference to the misconception, and 59% of those who saw no reference to the misconception correcting their mistake (χ2(2, N = 135) = 8.22, p = .016).",>Amy Masnick>Kristin Weingartner>Marisa Cohen,>Hofstra University>Hofstra University>St. Francis College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0590/index.html

In a corpus analysis, the vocabulary in picture books was richer and more extensive than that found in child-directed and even adult-directed speech. The grammar and complexity of these communication media, measured by reading grade level, indicated that picture books averaged two grades higher than child-directed speech and one grade higher than adult-directed speech. These differences between written and spoken language can be more adequately described by formal versus informal genres rather than their oral or written media. Given that the child will read words and grammar not experienced in speech, these results question the feasibility of the popular view that a child’s reading task is simply to “decode” the written language into spoken language.

2015,How soon is now? The language of timing in joint activities,"A key problem for models of joint action is to explain how co-ordination is established and sustained. Existing accounts emphasize the importance of interaction, demonstrating how collaborative feedback leads to more systematized, stable, and partner-specific referring conventions. However, in addition to conventionalizing referring expressions, recent work demonstrates how interlocutors also rapidly establish procedural conventions for resolving sequential and temporal co-ordination problems in the interaction. It is unclear, however, whether interlocutors associate these procedural conventions with specific conversational partners. To address this question, we report a collaborative, 3-participant, computer-mediated task which presents participants with the recurrent co-ordination problem of ordering their actions and utterances into a single sequence. Artificially generated clarification requests are inserted into the dialogue, that appear, to each participant, as if they originate from either of the 2 other participants. We argue that participants' responses to these clarifications provide evidence of interlocutors associating procedural conventions with specific partners.",>Gregory Mills,">University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0593/index.html

Through a computer game simulating different virtual scenes, pairs of participants sent and interpreted non-linguistic, minimal signals to achieve common goals. Participants’ signalling and interpretative actions demonstrated both flexibility and sensitivity to variations in the context of the shared visual scene: the same signal in one context could ‘flip’ its meaning in a new context. Such ‘invertible’ signals in the lab have their counterparts in patterns of real-world natural language use—from the phenomenon of enantiosemy (words/phrases that contain their ‘opposite’ meaning) to the pragmatics of satire and irony. But the emergence of such signals in our experiment challenges both correlational associative and recursive-mentalizing (‘mind-reading’) accounts of human communication and language. Instead, we point to a pragmatics-central perspective in which what is vital is our capacity for joint inference and coordination.",>Jennifer Misyak>Takao Noguchi>Nick Chater,>University of Warwick>University College London>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0594/index.html

Four different words - two positive and two negative - were simultaneously presented at the four corners of a display. Participants' eye movements were recorded as they search a word on the display after hearing it. We analyzed the gaze duration in each region of the display (target/distractors). In the ill-harmonized condition the target was found earlier compared with the harmonized condition. However the words were finished reading at same time in both condition. The results imply that the target and distractors were processed automatically because of the increase in words' perceptual fluency due to harmonization, thereby resulting in the delayed finding of the target.",>Kozue Miyashiro>Etsuko T.

The goal of this work is to better understand the potential mechanisms. We hypothesized that vocabulary diversity and sentence complexity might vary between picture books and child-directed speech, and we wanted to quantify those potential differences. We built a corpus consisting of the text of 100 picture books that caregivers might read to pre-literate children. We compared the distributions of vocabulary and certain complex sentences of that corpus to child-directed speech from the CHILDES corpus. We found that picture books contained a higher number of unique word types for a given number of tokens, and contained a higher proportion of complex sentences. The mechanisms by which shared book reading may contribute to improved language outcomes is by exposing children to words and sentence structures that they would not encounter otherwise.",>Jessica Montag>Michael Jones>Linda Smith,">Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0596/index.html

Such a model will be useful to support memory problems caused by such as aging. Based on this idea, we constructed an image recommender system including an ACT-R model. We build the model using the first author's private photo library, consisting 3,202 photos. We run a simulation manipulating the activation noise of declarative chunks. As a result, we found strong influence of the noise on memory retrieval. When the noise level was low, the model retrieved a few memory items that occurred recently. On the other hand, when the noise level was high, the retrieval process was like random walk over a memory network. Repeated recalls of old photos occurred.

Here, we presented masked pairs of images, which could be unrelated (e.g., a broken plate and an eagle), associatively related (e.g., a broken plate and a fork) or abstractly related (e.g., a broken plate and a fighting couple). Low-level features of the pairs were controlled for. In each trial, a masked pair (prime) was followed by a second pair (target) of a similar or different type. When the prime pair was visible, equal priming effects were found for both associatively related and abstractly related pairs. Yet when primes were rendered invisible, only associatively related pairs affected target processing. Our findings go beyond previous ones by demonstrating that two simultaneously presented distinct objects can be unconsciously integrated. Critically however, they suggest a crucial role for consciousness in processing semantic relations that transcend those of simple categorical associations.",>Liad Mudrik>Nathan Faivre>Sid Kouider>Christof Koch,>Teal Aviv University>École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne>Ecole Normale Supérieure>Allen Institute of Brain Science,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0598/index.html

We present extensions to a cross-situational learner that enable the first computational study of word generalization integrated within a word learning model.

I report an observational study of betting adverts over the 2014 soccer World Cup. Bet types vary in complexity, with complex types having the highest expected losses. Bookies herded on a common strategy of advertising special bets on two levels: by almost exclusively advertising complex bet types with high expected losses, and by advertising representative events within a given complex bet type. This evidence is most consistent with bookies’ advertising targeting a representativeness heuristic amongst bettors.

Children completed one of two conditions of the dimensional change card sort (DCCS), wherein children are asked to sort items by one dimension (e.g., shape), and then to switch and sort by another (e.g., color). In the standard condition, children were instructed to switch and sort by the second dimension after 6 pre-switch trials. In the choice condition, children were additionally allowed to make a choice before the rule switch (e.g., to touch either a sun or a moon icon). Children’s post-switch performance was significantly higher in the choice condition than in the instructed condition, indicating that giving children choice can aid their cognitive flexibility, even if this choice is not task relevant.",>Allison O'Leary>Vladimir Sloustky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0601/index.html
2015,Alternating Estimation of Local Objective and Global Purpose by Two-Layer Model of Emphasizing Factors,"To facilitate collaborative tasks that include different but related subordinate tasks, it is important to consider the consistency and coordination between the objectives of the subordinate tasks (local objectives) and the purposes of the entire task (global purposes). In this study, we propose a method that alternately propagates local objectives and global purposes during a collaboration through interactions using a two-layer model. We investigated the effects of the proposed method on human stress levels. We conducted an experiment in which we used two types of agents to evaluate the effect. Questionnaires confirm that the proposed method significantly improved impressions of consistency and naturalness. The results of our electrocardiogram analyses confirm that the participants' stress levels increased throughout the task when they interacted with the traditional agent. The analyses show the possibility that physiological indices can use to evaluate the collaborative task performance from the viewpoint of human stress.",>Yoshimasa Ohmoto>Asami Matsumoto>Toyoaki Nishida,>Kyoto University>Kyoto University>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0602/index.html
2015,The Effect of the Structural Differences of Concepts on Learning by Drawing versus Reading Diagrams,"Considerable studies indicate that structuring concepts within a diagram enhances learning (e.g. concept mapping), as opposed to learning by just reading the information. We examine whether the differences in the structure of information (hierarchical or linear string) affect learning based on the formation and drawing of a diagram. In our experiment, participants learned a family tree consisting of 6 members (Hierarchical) or the order of 6 participants in a relay race (Linear). While learning, half of the participants in each condition produced a drawing of the family tree or flow diagram of relay order (Drawing). In contrast, the other half read presented diagrams and wrote down the names (Reading). The results revealed that while participants in Hierarchical- Drawing performed better on the post-test than those in Hierarchical-Reading, there was no difference between the performance of participants in Linear-Drawing and Linear-Reading. That suggests the structural factor would affect the learning.",>Kayoko Ohtsu,>Waseda University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0603/index.html
2015,Individual differences in the use of cues during insight problem solving,"Previous studies indicated that facilitating effects of implicit hints on insight problem solving are not universal. To clarify the mechanisms of this variability, the relationship between the use of hints and individual differences in personality traits were investigated. Participants engaged in a Remote Associates Test in which solution words were subliminally presented in one third of the trials. During the test, participant’s pulse rate was measured as an indicator of arousal. After the test, participants completed the Big Five personality scale (TIPI-J). The participants’ “extroversion” and “openness” were positively correlated with the effect of hints during low pulse rate, whereas they were negatively correlated during high pulse rate. These results suggest that solver during low arousal could utilize the cues, and their search through the problem space may become broader. During high arousal, however, their focus attention may become narrower, and extrinsic cues may not be associated with the problem.",>Ryo Orita>Masasi Hattori,>Ritsumeikan University>Ritsumeikan University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0604/index.html
2015,Individual differences in older adults’ working memory capacity and speed of using touch interfaces,"I examined the effect of the working memory capacity (WMC) of older adult participants on tasks using touch interfaces, by using an extreme-groups design. Older participants (N = 100) completed a single tapping task and verbal, numerical, and spatial WMC tasks. To test whether the response time in the single tapping task differed as a result of the WMC, I performed a 2 x 2 Analyses of Variance with WMC (high, n = 25 /low, n = 25) as the between-subjects factors and the tapping interface (a touch pen, a finger, or a computer mouse) as within-subject factors. This indicated a significant interaction between the WMC and the tapping interface. The results suggested that the response time of participants with high WMC was shorter than the response time of participants with a low WMC, when using a touch pen and a computer mouse interface.",>Kazunori Otsuka,>University of Nagasaki,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0605/index.html
2015,How did Homo Heuristicus become ecologically rational?,"Gigerenzer and colleagues have proposed the ‘adaptive toolbox of heuristics’ as an account of resource-bounded human decision-making. According to these authors, evolution has endowed such toolboxes with ‘ecological rationality’, defined as the ability to make good quality decisions in their specific environments. Here we explore to what extent the mechanisms of evolution alone are sufficient to explain the emergence of ecologically rational toolboxes. It is not clear how evolution can lead to ecologically rational toolboxes within the space of possible toolboxes. That is, even if one assumes a very simple environment (e.g., 10 cues and 50 decisions), the number of possible toolboxes (10^72) is still astronomical. By using artificial evolution simulations we investigated the evolvability of ecologically rational toolboxes. We present preliminary results showing that evolution can produce toolboxes of heuristics that are “good enough” to survive, but those toolboxes are not ecologically rational.",>Maria Otworowska>Marieke Sweers>Robin Wellner>Todd Wareham>Iris van Rooij,">Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Department of Computer Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0606/index.html

The correct use of causal action components in speech and iconic gestures referring to these actions were coded. Results indicated that LHD patients were less accurate in using both components in speech compared to RHD and controls. There was no difference in the number of iconic gestures among groups. Yet, LHD patients were more likely to omit or misuse both components in speech and in gesture than RHD and controls. Particularly, damage to the left inferior and middle frontal gyrus resulted in problems in both modalities, suggesting conceptual deficits of causality.",>Demet Ozer>Idil Bostan>Anjan Chatterjee>Tilbe Goksun,>Koc University>Koc University>University of Pennsylvania>Koc University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0607/index.html
2015,"Sex Differences in Virtual Navigation Influenced by Scale, Visual Cues, Spatial Abilities and Lifetime Mobility","There are mixed findings with respect to individual or gender differences in virtual Morris water maze tasks, which may be attributed to variations in the scale of the space, the cues provided, and differences in spatial navigation experience and abilities. We explore the question of scale and context by presenting participants with either a large (146 m) or small (36 m) outdoor virtual Morris maze, along with a measure of lifetime mobility and mental rotation skills. Results of this study suggest that, for the small-scale environment, males and females performed similarly when asked to navigate with only close visual cues. However, males outperformed females when only far cues were visible. In the large-scale environment, males outperformed females in both cue conditions. Additionally, mental rotation abilities predicted better navigation performance with close cues only. Finally, we found that highly mobile females and males perform equally well when navigating with close cues.",>Lace Padilla>Sarah Creem-Regehr>Jeanine Stefanucci>Elizabeth Cashdan,">Department of Psychology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA>Department of Psychology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA>Department of Psychology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA>Department of Anthropology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0608/index.html

Neither magnitude knowledge nor procedural knowledge is necessary or sufficient for learning the other, and yet, correlations between the two are ubiquitous (e.g., Siegler & Pyke, 2013). Using correlational data (Structural Equation Models) and accuracy data (Knowledge Space Theory), potential causal models to describe the data were tested. Structural equation models did not differentiate between learning magnitude knowledge helping to learn procedural knowledge or vice versa. However, knowledge space model testing models of accuracy data provides support for the notion that learning procedural knowledge helps learning magnitude knowledge, and evidence against the reverse notion that learning magnitude knowledge helps learning procedural knowledge.

2015,Finger Gnosis And Symbolic Number Comparison as Robust Predictors of Adult Numeracy,"Finger gnosis and magnitude comparison were examined as predictors of adult numeracy. Previous findings were extended by (1) controlling for domain-general comparison processes (using a luminance judgment task), (2) controlling for visuo-spatial memory, and (3) examining the robustness of the relations across different numeracy tests, including exact and approximate calculations. Control variables were entered in the first step of a multiple regression, with finger gnosis and magnitude comparison entered as a second step. Finger gnosis and symbolic magnitude comparison predicted unique variance in adults’ calculation fluency, computational estimation, and Woodcock Johnson calculation scores. The control variables, luminance comparison and visuo-spatial memory, did not account for significant variance in the numeracy outcomes, nor did non-symbolic magnitude comparison. These findings suggest that (1) the relation between finger gnosis and numeracy does not reflect visuo-spatial memory and (2) the relation between magnitude comparison and numeracy reflects number representations, rather than domain general processes.",>Marcie Penner-Wilger>Rylan Waring>Adam Newton>Cindel White,>King's University College at Western University>King's University College at Western University>King's University College at Western University>King's University College at Western University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0610/index.html
2015,Emotionally mediated crossmodal correspondences affect classification performance,"Crossmodal music-to-color correspondences are mediated by emotion for classical music (Palmer et al., 2013) and diverse other genres. People tend to choose colors as going best with music when both have similar emotional associations (e.g., happy-looking colors go best with happy-sounding music). Lower level musical stimuli, including single-line melodies, two-note intervals, and instrumental timbres show analogous emotional effects, as do music-to-texture associations (Peterson et al., VSS-2014). Other crossmodal correspondences without emotional mediation (e.g., size/pitch associations) affect classification performance, modulate motion perception, and influence multisensory integration/perception (Spence, 2011). Do emotionally mediated crossmodal correspondences also produce such effects? We find that people are slower and/or less accurate at classifying the emotionality of stimuli (e.g., saturated yellow as happy) when simultaneously presented auditory stimuli are emotionally incongruent (e.g., the sad sound of a clarinet or minor chord) than when it is congruent (e.g., the happy sound of a piano or major chord).",>Joshua Peterson>Stephen Palmer,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0611/index.html
2015,"Semantic, not positional distances between words affect processing difficulty for sentences with relative clauses","Linearly organized structures in language are supposed to be easy, while hierarchical information is difficult to process. Traditional accounts attribute the difficulty of processing hierarchical sentences (the dog the man walks, barks) to the long positional distances between dependencies (Gibson, 1998). Alternately, linear structures (the man walks the dog that barks) are easier to process. In a sentence comprehension study, structure (i.e., positional distance between dependencies) was manipulated (hierarchical versus linear), and congruency between the semantic and the positional dependencies, being either congruent as in the dog the man walks, barks, neutral, as in the dog the man sees, walks, or incongruent as in the man the dog walks, barks (barks being syntactically dependent on man, but semantically on dog). The data show that structure did not, whilst semantic-syntactic congruency did strongly affect comprehension, suggesting a striking new perspective on the cognitive versus formal complexity of human language.",>Fenna Poletiek>Jun Lai,>Leiden University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0612/index.html
2015,A PDP Account of Transitions in Conceptual Development,"As children gain knowledge about the world, the organization of their conceptual knowledge becomes increasingly complex, as reflected by the successive emergence of sensitivity to different types of similarity over the course of development. At the start, when judging the similarity of two objects, infants rely on perceptual similarity. By age 3, children often make these judgments based on object co-occurrence, or thematic similarity. Finally, after ages 5-6, children reliably start to prefer taxonomic similarity. Though these phenomena have been well-studied, they are often explained by reference to separate mechanisms that are stipulated to come on-line at specific ages. We present a PDP model that learns from the structure of its environment and exhibits transitions in the relative salience of perceptual, thematic, and taxonomic similarity, as observed empirically, without any changes in its underlying learning mechanism or training environment.",>Robert Powers>David Plaut,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0613/index.html
2015,How is the result of the categorization process represented?,"How is the outcome of the categorization process represented? This question has gone virtually unaddressed. A notable exception is Barsalou (2012) which proposes that categorization results in a type–token predication, whereby the type representation (e.g. DOG) is predicated of the token representation of the categorized individual (e.g. Fido). Another is Jackendoff (1983) which proposes that categorization results in a token representation being related to the type representation via a two-place IS-AN-INSTANCE-OF function. Despite important differences, both proposals assume that type and token representations are extrinsically related to one another. This contrasts with recent research (Prasada & Dillingham, 2009; Prasada, 2013) which makes use of instance-of-kind representations in which type and token are intrinsically related. This poster identifies theoretical and empirical implications of the two approaches for representing the output of categorization, and argues that these favor the instance-of-kind representations.",>Sandeep Prasada,">Hunter College, CUNY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0614/index.html

Previous research indicates an interaction between walking and expressive and receptive language development. Given that phonology underlies expressive language production, in this study we are exploring potential relationships between locomotion and phonological development by examining phonetic inventories of age-matched peers who are walking or crawling. We are transcribing canonical utterances from high-volubility samples taken from daylong home audio recordings of 18 English-learning infants. Various phonetic features of the infants’ productions are compared across locomotor groups, in search of an interaction between phonological and locomotor development.

Simulated environments often show little or no transparency about the underlying structure. Making information about the system and the consequences of decisions available to users has been found to enhance learning. We tested a glass-box approach using highly interactive feedback tools to support implicit learning in a 3-hour DDM training session. Ninety participants were assigned to either the control (no training) or implicit learning condition. While performance on the training scenario improved over time, learning took place mostly in the beginning of the training session, and final performance remained far from optimal. Performance in the training scenario was positively correlated to performance in a test scenario.

In Chinese, classifiers (e.g., a sheet of) must be used whenever any noun is quantified or specified and must be congruent with noun meaning. Thirty-three Mandarin speakers read 120 sets of sentences that manipulated classifier-noun congruency (There is a machine-like-classifier/sheet-like-classifier computer on the table) and classifier presence (a machine-like-classifier computer vs. *a computer). A larger N400 component in the incongruent condition suggests that classifier-noun integration is primarily semantic. In the classifier-absent condition, a P600 was observed during the first half of the experiment but that diminished during the second half and an apparent Anterior Negativity emerged, suggesting that readers changed their processing strategy over time.",>Zhiying Qian>Susan Garnsey,>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0617/index.html

2015,The Social Evolution and Communicative Function of Noun Classification,"A central goal of typological research is to characterize linguistic features in terms of both their functional role and their fit to social and cognitive systems. One longstanding puzzle concerns why certain languages employ grammatical gender, which assigns nouns to distinct classes and marks neighboring words for agreement. While historically noun classification has been viewed as a useless ornament with little apparent rhyme or reason, there is an accumulating body of evidence that native speakers use determiners to guide lexical access. Here, we compare the communicative function of gender marking in German (a deterministic system) to that of prenominal adjective use in English (a probabilistic one), finding that despite their differences, both systems efficiently smooth information over discourse, making upcoming nouns more equally predictable in context. We hypothesize that evolutionary pressures may favor one system over another on account of how easy they are for children and adults to acquire.",>Michael Ramscar>Melody Dye>Petar Milin>Richard Futrell,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>Indiana University>University of Novi Sad>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0620/index.html

But we also experience untruthful, uninformative, and misleading communication when these norms are violated. How do people draw upon this experience when attempting to conceal the truth? We introduce a computational model which predicts how people should best conceal the truth when required to reveal information to another (and lying is not an option). We argue that when placed in such situations, people will take into account the other’s expectations of whether Gricean norms apply. This notion is incorporated in our model, which we test with an experiment that manipulates people’s assumptions in this regard. Results show that revealing informative but misleading information is an acceptable strategy when the other expects cooperation; otherwise, being uninformative is overwhelmingly preferred.

2015,Modeling the Role of Hippocampus in Extinction and Spontaneous Recovery,"The ability of animals to learn complex tasks from reward is still not fully understood. While models of such reinforcement learning exist (e.g., Sutton & Barto 1990), it is unclear how these models might reflect the functioning of biological neural networks. One recent model has shown how networks of spiking neurons can model reinforcement learning in animals (Chorley & Seth 2011), however, it and the existing models of animal behavior do not fully account for learning phenomena such as extinction, spontaneous recovery, and gradual extinction (Gershman et al. 2013). Interestingly, the model’s failures in extinction and spontaneous recovery are the same as those of rodents with hippocampal lesions (e.g., Kimble & Kimble 1970), suggesting that adding a spiking model of the hippocampus will better model these phenomena.

ETSI is a comprehensive 6-year science curriculum being implemented at Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in India, representing the most significant change in 600 years for the Tibetan Buddhist monastic curriculum. This two-way exchange between science and Buddhism offers potential for mutual enrichment leading to new discoveries.

The level of sensorimotor activation has been shown to be highly correlated with the concept of musical groove. We presented musical stimuli with high and low groove ratings to participants (N=40) as center of pressure (CoP) was recorded using a force platform. We found an effect of groove on radial sway in both non-musician and musician groups, with the high groove condition accompanied by the least amount of sway. Further analysis revealed a stronger correlation between musical events and postural sway deviations in the high groove condition when compared with the low groove condition, providing support for auditory-motor entrainment in postural sway. Our results show that periodicity in music can reduce sway variability in standing balance, possibly due to involuntary motor entrainment.",>Jessica Ross>Anne Warlaumont>Lillian Rigoli>Ramesh Balasubramaniam,">The University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, USA>The University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, USA>The University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, USA>The University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0624/index.html
2015,Asking useful questions: Active learning with rich queries,"Recently, both psychology and machine learning have explored the ability of learners to ask questions. However, much of this work has focused on a single type of question: a “label query”. When making a label query, the learner selects an unfamiliar (unlabeled) item and requests a label for it (e.g., ""What is this?""). We hypothesized that people often prefer much richer types of questions (e.g., feature queries: “Is this feature relevant?”, demonstration queries: “Can I see an example of a ladybug?”, etc.). To study this behavior, we had people play a simple game where they generated natural language questions to determine a hidden configuration of objects. We compute the normative value of these rich questions as measured by model-based analyses (e.g., information gain). A second experiment evaluates the ability of human observers to judge this value when the demands of question generation are removed.",>Anselm Rothe>Brenden Lake>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0625/index.html

While these elucidated the contribution of targets in the control, how trajectory itself influences movement strategy has received little attention. Here, using event-related fMRI, we examined neural processes of trajectory-based movement control as well as those of target-based control; we manipulated the focus of movement control by varying the size of a target (target-based control) or the window through which the movement had to pass (trajectory-based control). The brain activation maps showed that the increase in task difficulty with target-based control was associated with greater activation at right parietal and ventrolateral occipital regions, while that with trajectory-based control was correlated with more extensive activation at medial frontal and ventromedial occipital regions. These differential brain activities indicate that the neural mechanisms for target selection and trajectory control are distinct during visually-guided movements.",>Je-Kwang Ryu>Hee Sun Eum>Kyoung-Min Lee,>Seoul National University>Seoul National University>Seoul National University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0626/index.html

We found that in aggregate participants achieved only 56.0% success in correctly identifying whether images have been manipulated or not in verbal responses.

2015,Individual Differences in Base-rate Neglect: A Computational Dual Process Model,"Dual-process theories (DPT) of cognition posit that performance differences in reasoning stem from an interplay between heuristics-based processing (i.e., System 1) and more controlled, rule-based processing (System 2). Emerging evidence suggests that solving classic base-rate problems via Bayesian inference depends on adequately inhibiting the prepotent representations elicited by System 1 (De Neys, 2014). We propose that DPTs may benefit probabilistic models of reasoning by providing a framework on which to map individual difference predictions (e.g., how inhibitory capacity, prior knowledge, and motivation influence adherence to probabilistic rules). We present a dual-process computational model that implements various normative (i.e., Bayesian) and non-normative rules, which in turn are probabilistically fired based on a functional relationship between relative (de)activations of each system and variability in agents’ inhibitory capacity and motivation. Simulation results map onto behavioral data and replicate a variety of base-rate performance patterns, including base-rate neglect.",>Carlos Salas>Tim Sparer>Sabrina Velez>Thomas Griffin,>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Ilinois at Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0628/index.html
2015,"Inference, Not Dilution in the Dilution Effect","When asked to combine two pieces of evidence, one diagnostic and one non-diagnostic, people show a dilution effect: the addition of non-diagnostic evidence dilutes the overall strength of the evidence. This non-normative effect has been found in a variety of tasks and has been taken as evidence that people inappropriately combine information. We investigated the dilution effect using simple perceptual stimuli but unlike in previous work we asked participants to judge likelihoods ratios, allowing us to assess not just ordinal relationship between judgments but also whether each individual judgment was accurate. We found the dilution effect, but surprisingly it was not due to inaccurate combination of diagnostic and non-diagnostic information. People were accurate at judging diagnostic evidence combined with non-diagnostic evidence, but overestimated the strength of diagnostic evidence alone. We explain this within-participants dilution effect as the result of inference about missing features rather than incorrect combination of information.",>Adam Sanborn>Takao Noguchi>James Tripp>Neil Stewart,>University of Warwick>University College London>University of Warwick>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0629/index.html
2015,Giving dyads the silent treatment: Anticipatory joint action and the need for external action feedback,"Participants pressed computer keys to keep a moving dot stimulus within a rectangle, either alone or with a partner they could neither see nor hear. Pressing the A-key or L-key caused the dot to move right or left, respectively, for as long as the key was pressed. Switching between the A and L keys (i.e., turning) proved challenging: concurrently pressing both keys made the stimulus move upward, while pressing neither key made it move downward. Individuals performed better than dyads because they turned the dot near the edge of the rectangle and let it coast back and forth within the rectangle. Dyads turned the dot in the middle of the rectangle because they pressed their buttons as quickly as possible.

2015,"Apple, pomme, manzana: Productive vocabulary and cognitive flexibility in bilingual preschoolers","Little is known about how the experience of being bilingual and speaking two languages leads to advantages in cognitive control and flexibility (e.g., Bialystok & Martin, 2004). This study investigated productive vocabulary and knowledge of translation equivalents (TEs) as possible mechanisms underlying the bilingual advantage in cognitive flexibility and control. Spanish-English bilingual two-year-olds performed the Reverse Categorization Task (RCT; Carlson et al., 2004), which requires cognitive flexibility and control. Each child’s caregiver also completed the MCDI for English and Spanish to obtain a measure of each child’s productive vocabulary and knowledge of TEs. Correlation analyses showed that performance on the RCT was significantly correlated with productive knowledge of TEs but not cognates. These findings suggest that the experience of producing different words with the same meaning in two languages, as well as choosing between those words, may be an early mechanism underlying the bilingual advantage in cognitive control.",>Christina Schonberg>Natsuki Atagi>Catherine Sandhofer,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0631/index.html
2015,The Effect of Spatial Representations on Discounting Rates,"Prior research suggests that discounting rates– how much interest a person requests for waiting a period of time before collecting benefits– are influenced by perceptions of time. Other research, however, suggests people understand time via spatial representations. Thus, the current research examined whether underlying spatial representations of time influence these rates. Interest rate preferences were assessed twice over a semester from forty students in either art or cognition courses after drawing a picture with perspective or no perspective. Results revealed that drawing pictures without perspective led to higher average interest rates than drawing pictures with perspective. Additionally, there was an interaction of session and course; cognitive students’ rates increased substantially over time, while art students (i.e., students with practiced spatial representations) did not show this effect. These results are a preliminary step in suggesting that spatial priming can affect temporal representations, which in turn change discounting rates.",>Andrea J.

2015,The effect of empathy on comprehension and attitude in text reading,"This study investigated the effect of empathy in text comprehension. After 89 university students read a document which described how to write an educational practical report, they took a comprehension test and responded on the following scales: parallel empathy, reactive empathy, subjective comprehension, and attitude. In the framework of dual-process theory, parallel empathy depends on system 1 while reactive empathy is controlled by system 2. As a result, the mean comprehension test score in the condition in which students read the document describing only procedure and some cautions was higher, but the mean reactive empathy score was lower than that in the condition in which students read the document including empathic episodes of the author with illustrations, in addition to the procedure and cautions. An analysis by structural equation modeling with previous data suggested that adding empathic episode disturbed text comprehension, but enhancing empathy promoted subjective comprehension and attitude change.",>Hideaki Shimada,>Shinshu University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0633/index.html
2015,Decreasing Music Familiarity Increases Incorporation of Music Themes in a Generation Task,"We examine whether the familiarity of thematic music affects the degree to which concepts associated with the music are activated after listening to the music and subsequently affect generation task performance. In two experiments, participants listened to one of two excerpts of war-themed music varying in familiarity either before or after completing Amabile’s (1985) American Haiku task. Haikus were examined to determine the degree to which concepts associated with the music were affected by music familiarity. Experiment 1 demonstrated that associated music concepts for both familiar and unfamiliar music were included in the haiku at equal rates when the music was listened to prior to writing the haiku. Experiment 2 demonstrated that listening to moderately familiar rather than unfamiliar music before the haiku task resulted in more music associates being included. Explanations of how familiarity and other factors affect incorporation of war-themed music concepts into the haiku will be discussed.",>Cynthia Sifonis>Jonathan Saulter>William Fuss,>Oakland University>Oakland University>Oakland University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0634/index.html
2015,Contextual determinants of category-based expectations during single-word recognition,"Highly predictive sentential contexts can facilitate the generation of expectancies for low-level physical form-based properties of upcoming linguistic input. When contextual information (such as words in a sentence) constrains upcoming input to a specific syntactic category, words with category-typical physical form-based properties are processed more quickly than category atypical words. We aim to determine whether expectancies for grammatical category can be induced in experimental paradigms where words are presented in isolation. We demonstrate that properties of the stimuli to which participants respond can facilitate, through experience with the task, the generation of category-based expectancies. When all words were nouns, participants were more accurate on lexical decision and category judgments when targets possessed category-typical form-based features. When words from multiple categories were present, however, the typicality effect disappeared, suggesting higher-level expectancies can be induced without sentential context and modulate the effects of lexical- and form-based properties of words.",>Francis Smith>Danielle Reece>Padraic Monaghan>Morten Christiansen>Thomas Farmer,>University of Iowa>University of Iowa>Lancaster University>Cornell University>University of Iowa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0635/index.html

2015,Alien Bacteria Found on Mars! A Model of Conceptual Change using the Re-categorization Paradigm,"Many conceptual change theories posit that change occurs due to a variety of cognitive, social, and emotional factors (Dole & Sinatra, 1998; Ohlsson, 2011), however, few theories have tested these claims via computational models of conceptual change. In this paper, we present a hierarchical Bayesian model that addresses change processes and their effects on re-categorization, a form of concept change. Human data from a study using the re-categorization paradigm (Ramsburg & Ohlsson, 2013) are compared to the computational model. The structure of the human data suggests the ‘non-monotonic’ nature of conceptual change (Ohlsson, 2011) as indicated by the best-fit learning curves. For several such curves, model comparisons suggest good fits between the computational simulations and human data. The nonlinear form of the model’s update functions lends additional support to concept change as a non-monotonic process. The model is discussed as a “proof of concept” for future conceptual change modeling endeavors.",>Tim Sparer>Jared Ramsburg>Carlos Salas>Stellan Ohlsson,">University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America>University of Illinois at Chicago",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0637/index.html

2015,Topological Dependence of Rate Code Stability,"How does network topology affect neural coding? We approached this question with a large parametric study simulating clustered network topologies of cortical excitatory spiking neurons with inhibitory interneurons, while taking into account variance in axonal length and spike propagation times. To evaluate the stability of rate coded information, we systematically varied within cluster conduction delay means, variances, and connection densities, as well as between cluster conduction delay means, variances, and connection densities. Networks received rate coded stimulation from one cluster, and we varied frequency and spike jitter of this input. Networks contained 960 excitatory and 240 inhibitory neurons, divided evenly between 6 recurrently connected clusters. We found that variances of inter-spike intervals in the presence of rate coded stimulation were greatly increased with the introduction of even small variances in between cluster conduction delays and by changes in inter-cluster and within-cluster connection density, identifying topologies that resist stable rate coding.",>William B.

2015,Is the listener really listening? Exploring the effect of verbal and gestural speaker cues on backchanneling.,"It is well known that listeners of probably all languages give verbal and non-verbal signals, called backchannels, to their interlocutors. However, it is not well understood what drives listeners to backchannel. To what degree are they an indicator of listener attention? Are backchannels semantically motivated, performed when the message has been parsed and comprehended? Or are they automatic responses triggered by overt cues from the speaker (such as eye contact, gestures, or prosodic information), requiring minimal comprehension? An important first step in answering this question is identifying what overt speaker cues trigger backchannels, and to what degree. This preliminary study looks at storytelling data from conversational dyads. We find that the speaker cue most likely to ‘successfully’ trigger a backchannel is making eye contact. Interestingly, however, other cues are more likely to trigger different kinds of backchannels: gestural cues trigger more head nods, while prosodic cues trigger more verbal backchannels.",>Matthew Stave>Eric Pederson,>University of Oregon>University of Oregon,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0641/index.html

In two experiments, students translated between diagrams of molecules and received verbal feedback in one of three intervention conditions: with concrete models, with virtual models, or without models. Learning was measured in three posttests (with models, without models, and after a 7-day delay). Virtual models had either low (Study 1) or high (Study 2) congruence between actions performed with the input device and resulting movements of the virtual model. In terms of learning outcomes, model-based feedback was superior to verbal-feedback alone, models functioned as a scaffold rather than as a crutch, and learning with model-based feedback was resilient over a 7-day delay. Finally, concrete and virtual models were equivalent in promoting learning, and action congruence did not affect learning.",>Andrew Stull>Mary Hegarty,">University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0642/index.html

There are two paradoxical, yet “rational”, strategies to approach this decision-making problem. We addressed this debate by testing the paradox in a real world experiment. Analyzing participants' mouse movements allowed us to reveal the internal cognitive dynamics of their thought process during the task explanation as well as the actual decision. This knowledge of internal processes helped us to accurately (73%) predict their decision before it was made. Moreover, the consistency of mouse movements before and during the actual decision significantly interacted with RT. This suggests that subjects were revealing their indecision in the mouse movement, and that this indecision weighed on both possibilities.

2015,Imagine That: The Relationship between Imagery Measures and Imagery Types,"Imagery is an important feature of mental simulation, which is central to human cognitive functions from decision making to joint action to language production. Imagery is often used as a mental rehearsal strategy in areas of expertise, such as music, athletics and surgery, but also in movement rehabilitation. Individual imagery abilities may vary by general, modality-unspecific imagery capacity, as well as by imagery types. Within the literature, multiple tests have been used to measure imagery ability in various modalities such as visual, auditory, motor and spatial imagery. Participants (n=301) completed common imagery questionnaires (MIQ3, VMIQ2, BQMI, VVIQ, MASMI, OSIVQ, BAIS, CAIS). Findings suggest that greater reported dance, video game or music experience is related to increased kinesthetic, spatial or auditory imagery ability respectively. Other individual differences were found across subscales of the same modality, suggesting issues with reliability between questionnaires.

In this study (N = 30), we examined fixation and duration data on interface-related areas of interest (AOI)-pairs as indicators of cognitive and metacognitive SRL strategies, and whether the frequencies of fixations and proportion of time spent on these AOI-pairs differed between prior knowledge groups. Results indicated that high prior knowledge learners selected significantly more cognitive (e.g., summarize) SRL strategies than learners with low prior knowledge. Additionally, learners with low prior knowledge spent a significantly higher proportion of time engaging in help seeking behavior, compared to high prior knowledge learners.

Both classic research and recent work suggest the benefit of paired comparisons in PL, but no previous work has used adaptive techniques to trigger comparisons. We asked whether PL can be enhanced by adaptively triggered comparison trials, in which erroneous responses led to comparisons designed to distinguish confusable categories. Undergraduates learned to interpret basic patterns from electrocardiograms (ECGs) with either: (1) adaptive PL based on single category exemplars, (2) adaptive PL combined with adaptively triggered comparisons, (3) adaptive PL combined with non-adaptive comparisons.

Here, we use a different population (from India) to further investigate this possibility. We also test whether nuanced factors like language proficiency, usage context, and age of acquisition affect the degree to which people show a foreign language effect. We do not find a strong difference between native and second language speakers. However, we do find a more nuanced effect of language proficiency: people who are more proficient in the target language show more loss aversion. We also find that proficient English speakers are more willing to take on risk in both experiments, suggesting that English, itself, may lead people to think differently – possibly because it is a highly agentive language or because it is associated with individualistic cultural values.",>Paul Thibodeau>Evelyn Kalafus-Mastenbrook>Matias Berretta>Aliya Tuzhilin>Nupur Agrawal,>Oberlin College>Oberlin College>Oberlin College>Oberlin College>Trinity University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0648/index.html

Participants were shown two statements describing attributes and asked to estimate how many people had either one attribute, conjunction, or disjunction of attributes. In our Bayesian simulations we compare models in which participants either adopt a single strategy or sample from a set of strategies when forming estimates of both conjunctions and disjunctions. We compared every permutation of models in which a participant is responding based on a single component, a weighted average of the two events, probability theory, or combination of strategies.

The concepts behind emotional words have both affective and cognitive components, hence emotional concepts might have unique pattern of semantic properties. The present study then strives to compare the semantic properties of the three kinds of concepts. Concrete, abstract, and emotional words were selected, and participants had to report the property freely. Collected properties were categorized according to the semantic frame proposed by Wu and Barsalou (2009), and distributions of properties across three kinds of concepts were examined.

You are then asked if you think EE is a valid word. Most people identify EE as a valid word; they are sensitive to the fact that all the valid words consist of two identical letters, whereas the invalid words do not. This is known as an identity effect, and has been observed in artificial language learning experiments and in a diverse range of natural languages. I give a formal proof that many popular learning framework, including methods for training neural network of arbitrary number of layers, cannot learn such identity effects. The proof exploits symmetries in the architectures and their training regimes to show that such learners cannot perform with human-like behaviour on these grammatical judgment tasks.",>Paul Tupper,>Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0651/index.html
2015,Induction with Familiar and Newly-Learned Categories in Young Children,"Accounts of induction development suggest that young children’s inferences are based either on object kind knowledge (Gelman & Markman, 1986), or on perceptual similarity (e.g., Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004). However, both accounts suggest that inferences with familiar and newly-learned categories engage a common set of psychological processes (determination of object kind or perceptual similarity). Alternately, young children may perform similarity-based induction with newly-learned categories, but use prior knowledge to make inferences with familiar categories. In this study, children complete two versions of a task in which a property attributed to a target can be extended to a category match or a perceptual match. In one version, items belong to familiar biological categories; in the other, items belong to two novel pseudo-biological categories. Preliminary findings indicate that although Kindergarten-age children learn to accurately categorize the novel items, they make similarity-based inferences with newly-learned categories, and category-consistent inferences with familiar categories.",>Layla Unger>Anna Fisher,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0652/index.html

Reduction can be interpreted in terms of demonstrating automatization of effort (Vajrabhaya & Pederson, 2014). This study specifically investigates a special type of gesture used when speakers are accessing a low-familiarity lexeme. These gestures are assumed to aid lexical retrieval (Rauscher, Krauss, & Chen, 1996) and might be expected to not reduce as long as lexical access remains difficult. Unexpectedly, results show that these gestures also reduce across repetition like any other gesture and independent of lexical access difficulties.

2015,Social network structure contributes to differences in language use,"Some theories of language see it as a complex and highly adaptive system. For example, language may adapt to certain social or demographic variables of a linguistic community. If so, language may be used as an indication of certain social influences. Studies have begun to explore how the structure of social-networks contribute to language use. Until recently, datasets large enough to test how subtle effects of socio-cultural properties—spanning vast amounts of time and space—influence language change have been difficult to obtain. We analyzed over one million online business reviews using network analyses and information theory to quantify social connectivity and language structure. Results indicate that sometimes a surprisingly high proportion of variance in individual language use can be accounted for by differences in social structure. We consider how big data can be used as an arena for testing the influence of social variables on language use.",>David Vinson>Rick Dale,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0655/index.html

In this presentation we will present an experiment designed to investigate the visual-analytic shift in knowledge about molecular structure in 132 11th graders. The results showed that the students, who were novices in chemistry, could solve the items requiring visual strategies but not those requiring analytic strategies, suggesting that they had not achieved the visual/analytic shift.

This pattern is referred to as monotonic generalization. In earlier work, we have found evidence for non-monotonic generalization when negative observations are involved. For example, we presented participants with the information that Mozart’s music has a certain property, asking to judge the likelihood of the conclusion that Metallica’s music too has the property. We found people more willing to accept the conclusion if they were additionally informed that the sound of a falling rock does not have the property. Here, we test the hypothesis that non-monotonic generalization following negative observations crucially depends on the reasoner’s assumptions regarding the way the arguments were constructed.

To that end, participants read easy and difficult texts while their eye movements were recorded. After each reading, participants filled-in comprehension questionnaires. We investigated classical measures of the reading process related to comprehension (fixation duration, regressive eye movements), as well as power-law scaling in eye movements that are indicative of degree of cognitive coordination during reading. The results show that text difficulty led to longer fixation durations and stronger power-law scaling in eye movements. Moreover, the degree of power-law scaling in eye movements was predictive of text comprehension. In line with previous research on natural text reading that utilized the self-paced reading method, power-law scaling turned out to be a superior predictor of reading comprehension compared to standard measures, suggesting that it is an effective measure of cognitive performance in complex reading tasks.",>Sebastian Wallot>Charles Coey>Mike Richardson,">Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0658/index.html

However, little is known about whether the two processing types are affected by spatial attention. In our study, spatial attention was manipulated by asking participants to attend to the left or right visual field. We found that configural face processing elicited a larger P1 compared to featural face processing when they were attended. In contrast, the P2 was larger for featural relative to configural face processing when they were attended. Therefore, the results suggested that configural and featural face processing are differentially affected by spatial attention at different time windows.",>Hailing Wang>Shimin Fu,>Tsinghua University>Tsinghua University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0659/index.html

Learning words from cross-situational statistics (Yu & Smith 2007) has been argued to be critical for lexical acquisition, but the resulting representations are not well understood. Here, we examine the claim from Hamrick & Rebuschat (2014) that cross-situational learning results in implicit representations. Three experiments provide evidence to the contrary. First, we establish that confidence ratings positively correlate with accuracy. By using a cover story where participants were not told to infer word meaning, only highly confident answers were above chance, contrary to what accounts of implicit memory would predict.

2015,Developing an Integrated and Comprehensive Traditional Chinese Corpus Based on Multi-Character Words for Studying relations between words and lexicons,"Most of Chinese corpus were created for single-character words with indexes, such as frequency, stroke number, and phonetic information, for the purposes of basic research. However, multi-character Chinese words are recognized of referring alterations of meaning and more useful for investigating reading processes and comprehension. Therefore, for studying complete relations between words and lexicons of Chinese, a corpus requires statistics based on more than single-character words with valid and reliable indexes. In this study, we illustrate a corpus of Traditional Chinese providing five word indexes, including word sound, word position, word form, semantics, and competence of forming multi-character words by integrating current credible corpus. The integration approach of the present study is beneficial not only for minimizing inconsistencies of word entities between corpus, but also for calculating quantitative properties of character-to-character relationship. The utilization of the present corpus will significantly impact the studies of Chinese words and reading comprehension.",>Chung-Ching Wang>Sau-chin Chen>Yueh Lin Tsai>Yong-Ru Hsiao>Jon-Fan Hu,">National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>Department of Human Development, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung Univeristy, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0661/index.html
2015,Getting what you Ordered: Symbolic and Non-Symbolic Ordinality as Predictors of Exact and Approximate Calculation in Adults,"Performance on symbolic and non-symbolic numeric order determination tasks was examined as predictors of Woodcock Johnson calculation (exact) and computation estimation (approximate) scores among university aged adults. For Woodcock Johnson scores, only the symbolic task variant was found to be a significant predictor of performance outcomes after entering both task variants into a multiple regression. For the computational estimation task, both symbolic and non-symbolic task variants were significant predictors of performance outcomes. However, when controlling for general math ability (using Woodcock Johnson scores in the first step of a multiple regression), only the non-symbolic task variant remained predictive of computational estimation scores. Predictors remained significant for each outcome measure after controlling for non-numerical (luminance) order determination tasks through regression. These findings suggest that 1) the relations are due to numeric (not general order) judgements, and 2) both symbolic and non-symbolic task variants are related to specific mathematical outcome measures.",>Rylan J.

In this study, Chinese (n=110) 4-and 6-year-olds were directly compared to the U.S. children in Seiver, Gopnik & Goodman (2013). Children were shown covariation evidence that varied across conditions to imply that a person, situation, or neither was the cause of a person’s actions. Following observation, children were asked to explain why the person engaged in the actions. Findings indicate that U.S. children significantly increased the amount of person attributions they made with age, while Chinese 4-and 6-year-olds answered comparably. Children from both cultures were sensitive to covariation manipulations when they suggested a person was the cause of an action. Only U.S. children were sensitive to evidence when it favored the situation.",>Adrienne Wente>Sophie Bridgers>Xin Zhao>Yixin Cui>Elizabeth Seiver>Li Zhanxing>Liqi Zhu>Alison Gopnik,">University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>Stanford University>Cornell University>Columbia University>University of California, Berkeley>Chinese Academy of Science>Chinese Academy of Science>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0663/index.html
2015,Context vs. Compositionality: How Do Context-induced Ad-hoc Affordances Interact with Semantically Stored Telic Information? – An ERP Study,"In an ERP study we investigate the time course of the interaction between the lexically specified telic role of a noun and the contextually provided ad-hoc affordance induced by a linguistic discourse. If preceded by a neutral discourse context, a verb inconsistent with the telic role in a sentence elicits an enhanced N400 compared to a congruent verb. However, if the preceding discourse context induces an ad-hoc affordance for the object that conflicts with the lexically specified telic role of the referring noun, we observe a crossing-over: compared to the neutral context, the N400 elicited by the inconsistent verb is significantly reduced in this context, whereas the N400 elicited by the congruent verb is significantly enhanced. We interpret these results as a consequence of the immediate functional replacement of the telic role with the contextually triggered ad-hoc affordance, thus supporting a single-step model of sentence meaning composition.",>Markus Werning>Jarmo Kontinen>Erica Cosentino,">Ruhr Universtity Bochum, Bochum, NRW, Germany>Ruhr Universtity Bochum, Bochum, NRW, Germany>Ruhr Universtity Bochum, Bochum, NRW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0664/index.html
2015,Multisensory Integration Induces Body Ownership of an External Tool,"Bodily self-consciousness (BS) refers to self-knowledge like body shape, position and ownership. BS relies on the integration of multisensory bodily signals and can be experimentally manipulated with the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI). In this illusion, the incorporation of a rubber hand into the BS is facilitated by visual similarity to the participant’s hand. Neurophysiological research indicates that tool use alters neural networks mapping body shape and posture for coordinating motor actions. The present experiment sought to unify perceptual and motoric BS accounts using a modified RHI. We found that synchronous multisensory stimulation induced perceptual embodiment of an external tool. The RHI was stronger if multisensory stimulation was preceded by tool use, highlighting the motor system’s role in embodiment. The illusion, as measured by proprioceptive drift and questionnaires, was stronger for skilled individuals but also occurred for untrained participants. This experiment helps to clarify the role of perceptual and motoric embodiment.",>Veronica Weser>Gianluca Finotti>Dennis Proffitt,">University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA>University G.

2015,Semantic Processing in the Context of the PRP Paradigm: Structurally or Strategically Bottlenecked?,"It is widely believed that semantic activation from print is not capacity limited (i.e., that it does not need attentional resources). Prior research has tested this assumption by examining the Stroop effect in the context of the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. These studies yielded additivity of the Stroop effect and SOA on RT, consistent with the hypothesis that semantic activation is itself capacity limited (given demonstrations that prior processes are not capacity limited). There is, however, an alternative explanation for such additivity: performance optimization (Miller and colleagues, 2009). Given that participants in PRP experiments are told to respond as quickly as possible, they may opt to process serially to improve performance. We investigated whether additivity of the Stroop effect (standard and semantic) and SOA in the context of PRP is best explained in terms of a structural bottleneck or performance optimization.",>Darcy White>Derek Besner,">University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0666/index.html
2015,Historical Cognition: An Investigation of Factors Affecting Reasoning about Historical Causality,"We assessed whether students’ reasoning about historical causality is biased by accessibility and previous knowledge. Undergraduates in Canada provided explanations for historical events: the attacks on Pearl Harbor and September 11, 2001. Participants were then given several explanations for these events, including conventional historical and alternative conspiracist explanations, and reported how satisfying they found them. Overall, historical explanations were more satisfying than alternative explanations. Historical explanations were more satisfying for Pearl Harbor than 9/11, and alternative explanations were more satisfying for 9/11 than Pearl Harbor. Similarly, ease of generating an explanation was associated with satisfaction with historical explanations for Pearl Harbor, and with satisfaction with alternative explanations for 9/11. Participants’ general conspiracist beliefs were also associated with acceptance of alternative and historical explanations. Students learn about Pearl Harbor in history class, whereas information about 9/11 comes primarily from the media, leaving the door open to a multiplicity of ahistorical explanations.",>Cindel White>Marcie Penner-Wilger>Graham Broad,>King's University College at Western University>King's University College at Western University>King's University College at Western University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0667/index.html
2015,Perspective Taking in Communicative Pointing: An Optimal Feedback Control Modeling Approach,"Pointing movements can serve instrumental goals (‘pointing to press a button’) or communicative goals (‘pointing to indicate to someone which button to press’). Previous work has shown that communicative pointing follows different trajectories, and has different end points than instrumental pointing movements, depending on the addressee’s spatial location. This suggests that motor control processes are affected by communicative intentions, but the nature of this interface remains unknown. Using optimal feedback control theory, we construct a model of instrumental pointing, and explore how this model can be adjusted to reproduce the dependency between communicative trajectories and addressees’ locations. Our results show that the variations in end points cannot account for those trajectories. Instead, the kinematic data are best explained by ‘perspective taking’ on the part of the communicator, i.e., communicative pointing movements seem to be planned in a frame of reference that is adjusted to the addressee’s point of view.",>Tobias Winner>Luc Selen>Lennart Verhagen>Pieter Medendorp>Ivan Toni>Iris van Rooij,">Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0668/index.html
2015,"Gestures in the TV News reflect mental number space: ""Tiny"" and ""low"" numbers","Past research suggests that people think about numbers in terms of multiple spatial mappings. For instance, they think of “more” as “bigger” or “higher” (e.g., Andres et al., 2008; Sell & Kaschak, 2012). Here, we investigate mental number space by looking at naturally occurring co-speech gestures. Using the TV News Archive (archive.org/details/tv), we selected a random sample of 1,320 videos containing the phrases “tiny number,” “huge number,” “high number” and “low number,” of which 314 had associated manual gestures. Our analysis shows that with “tiny number,” speakers produce pinching gestures; with “huge number,” they move their hands outward; with “high numbers,” the palms are oriented and move upward; and with “low numbers,” the palms are oriented and move downward. Speakers did not gesture systematically along the horizontal axis. This work provides new insights into how people’s spatial conceptualizations of numbers shape communicative practice in naturally occurring discourse.",>Bodo Winter>Marcus Perlman>Teenie Matlock,">University of California, Merced, Cognitive and Information Sciences>University of Wisconsin, Madison, Department of Psychology>University of California, Merced, Cognitive and Information Sciences",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0669/index.html
2015,Children’s ability to infer beliefs and desires from emotional reactions,"Children can recover beliefs from knowledge of an agent’s actions and desires, or desires from her actions and beliefs. However, both beliefs and desires are sometimes unknown and underdetermined by agents’ actions. Here we ask how emotional expressions might support mental-state inferences that are otherwise ambiguous given agents’ actions. We present two experiments, showing that children (mean: 5.9 years) can infer beliefs and desires simultaneously from change or stability in the valence of emotional expressions between when agents expect and observe outcomes. However, children did not infer that surprised expressions indicated false beliefs, or the absence of surprise, true beliefs, in the context of joint belief-desire reasoning. Rather they inferred that positively valenced responses to outcomes indicate true beliefs and negative responses indicated false beliefs. We propose that emotional expressions support rational inferences about mental states, consistent with the expectation that agents act on their desires given their (probabilistic) beliefs.",>Yang Wu>Chris Baker>Josh Tenenbaum>Laura Schulz,>MIT>MIT>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0670/index.html
2015,A model comparison on perception of arm movements in point-light display,"Since Johanson (1973), it is well known that people perceive human behavior, not only familiar ones such as walking and dancing but also unfamiliar behaviors in point-light display. While categorization among well-known behaviors has been well studied, it is not clear yet how people extract the cues that are useful for perceiving unfamiliar behaviors. We hypothesized that the hierarchical information in human structure was playing an important part for perception of unfamiliar behaviors, and examined this hypothesis by comparing performances of three kinds of models in categorization tasks of unfamiliar arm movements. While the first model was based only on local motion of the point lights, the second model used hierarchical ordering information to analyze the local motion. The third model used strict positioning following the hierarchical structure in addition to the ordering information. The comparison suggested that hierarchical ordering was important information to producing close performance to human performance.",>Reiko Yakushijin>Sachiyo Ueda,>AOYAMA GAKUIN UNIVERSITY>OCHANOMIZU UNIVERSITY,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0671/index.html
2015,Adaptation to Unexpected Word-Forms in Highly Predictive Sentential Contexts,"Readers and listeners rely upon previous experience to generate predictions about multiple aspects of an unfolding linguistic signal. Error signals elicited by unexpected input feed forward to higher-level units, serving in the adjustment of expectancies and thus increasing the precision of predictions in that context. When a syntactic ambiguity is resolved with a dis-preferred continuation, a garden-path effect occurs, but decreases in magnitude as a function of exposure to the unexpected event. But, can readers adjust lower-level expectations about word forms in contexts that do not permit overt higher-level ambiguity? We monitored eye-movements as participants read expected or unexpected words in highly-constraining sentences. Half of items contained the predicted word and half contained a plausible but unexpected word. Adaptation—in the form of decreased fixation duration on unexpected words—was observed on first fixation duration but nowhere else, suggesting that adaptation occurs at different levels of a multilayered processing system.",>Shaorong Yan>Thomas Farmer,">Department of Psychology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA>Department of Psychology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0672/index.html
2015,Neural Basis of Episodic Memory Development: Evidence from Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms,"Episodic memory involves a mechanism that binds information into a coherent representation structure. Especially, more complex memory structures are required when there are more overlapping elements among different episodes (Humphreys, Bain & Pike, 1989), and the ability to use memory structures of different complexities increases throughout development (Yim, Dennis, & Sloutsky, 2013). Although the major neural structures considered to underlie the development of episodic memory are the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus, it is possible that the development of episodic memory involves multiple brain mechanisms interacting with different types memory structure. The current study tries to examine the division of labor between the PFC and hippocampus when forming different types of binding structure in episodic memory development. We utilized a multinomial processing tree (MPT) model, and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) genotyping approach to elucidate the division of labor between different brain areas involved in forming different memory structures.",>Hyungwook Yim>Simon Dennis>Christopher Bartlett>Vladimir Sloutsky,">The Ohio State University, USA>University of Newcastle, Australia>The Ohio State University, USA>The Ohio State University, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0673/index.html

The use of these kinds of information in L1 can also be easily transferred to deal with L2 listening for bilingual listeners. In the present study, a word-spotting experiment was conducted to examine this issue and the results revealed that the Cantonese-English bilingual listeners might not make use of all their L1 probabilistic phonotactics in segmenting the L2 speech.",>Michael C.

2015,Using false belief task to explore the effect of empathy situation on Theory of Mind function,"Theory of Mind (TOM) is an ability to simulate mental activities, attribute intention, and predict behaviors of others. According to Ickes’s study (1990), there are strong correlation between empathy and TOM. However, whether they have any causal-effect relationship is still unclear. It is possible to differentiate the two processes from a developmental perspective since TOM ability develops later than empathy. This study aimed to study the influence of empathy on TOM processes. In the experiment (N=28), 4-year-olds children received a traditional false belief task first; and then after a week, they were divided into two different empathic situations: bullying condition and bully-victim condition. The study found a trend that the TOM score is lower in the bullying condition but higher in the bully-victim condition compared to the baseline condition despite of the insufficient subjects. It suggests that empathic states indeed impact TOM processing.",>Chi-Lin Yu>Min-Ying Wang>Pei-Wen Chen>Joe-Yi Yap>Jen-Shen Chang>Yong-Ru Hsiao>Jon-Fan Hu,">National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0675/index.html
2015,What senses of agency can infants have?,"The ‘sense of agency’—the feeling of doing—is a phenomenological experience that cannot be taken for granted in infants. Researching the development of this phenomenon hinges on its conceptualization. Although it may seem natural to ask “When do infants have sense of agency?”, this binary view on the presence (or absence) of a sense of agency seems conceptually problematic. Cognitive phenomenological research reveals that sense of agency is a complex set of agentive experiences with different contents (e.g. ‘the experience of acting’, ‘the experience of volition’) that are often conflated. Given that different contents presuppose different representational capacities, developmental psychology may better target the question “What senses of agency can infants have at different developmental stages?” We show how this re-conceptualization impacts the interpretation of existing empirical findings in infant research, and how it can improve our understanding of the developmental trajectory of infants’ experiences of agency.",>Lorijn Zaadnoordijk>Sabine Hunnius>Marlene Meyer>Johan Kwisthout>Iris van Rooij,">Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0676/index.html
2015,Categorical Perception of Labeled and Unlabeled ASL Facial Expressions in Hearing Non-signers,"Previous research has demonstrated categorical perception (CP) of facial expressions from American Sign Language (ASL) in hearing, English-speaking non-signers. Notably, CP was observed even for faces with no obvious linguistic labels in English, suggesting the existence of covert categories based on nonlinguistic facial properties. However, in the earlier work, CP was assessed using memory procedures, leaving open the possibility that such categories have no impact on the discrimination of simultaneously presented faces. Here, we used a visual search task with no memory component to test for CP for both labeled (happy/sad) and unlabeled (adverbial expressions with no lexical signs) categories of ASL facial expressions. CP was observed for both sets of categories, suggesting that unlabeled covert categories——not just labeled ones——are accessed even when stimuli are readily available to perception.

However, little work has examined how these processes relate to one another and their associated learning outcomes. In this study we explored two methodologies to measure and relate these processes to one another by investigating students verbal protocols and task-based self-reports during a learning task. We investigated (1) whether specific metacognitive skills are more likely to occur before, during, or after self-explanation and analogical comparison, (2) individual differences in students’ use of these skills, and (3) whether specific skills results in better learning outcomes.

2015,Learning multiple kinds of associations during cross-situational word learning,"Learning the meanings of words involves not only forming connections between individual words and concepts but also building a network of connections across objects and words. Previous studies reveal that infants and adults can learn word-referent links across multiple ambiguous training instances by tracking the statistical co-occurrence of labels and objects (Smith & Yu, 2008; Dautriche & Chemla, 2014). We asked whether adults are sensitive to multiple types of statistical structure in these learning instances by manipulating the frequency with which objects co-occurred with each other during training trials. Across several studies (n=150), we find that adults not only learned to disambiguate label referents, but simultaneously formed connections both between the frequently co-occurring objects themselves and between the labels of frequently co-occurring objects. These findings indicate that learners exploit statistical regularities to form multiple types of associations during word learning.",>Martin Zettersten>Erica Wojcik>Viridiana L.

2015,Statistical learning of auditory patterns as trajectories through a perceptually defined similarity space,"Most accounts of statistical learning (e.g., Saffran et al., 1996) assume that the learner computes cooccurrence statistics over units, such as syllables, that abstract away from the physical features of the input. This assumption need not hold when the units are underlearned, unfamiliar, or uncategorizable. We tested statistical learning with variable, unfamiliar units and show that if the featural variation is small, adults treat words differently from part-words and non-words, as if learning were occurring over abstract units. When the featural variation is large, and the categorical boundaries are unclear, participants can still learn statistical regularities defined over trajectories through this space: Words, part words and even non-words that follow trajectories consistent with the familiarization set are rated as equally familiar, whereas non-words that take trajectories opposite the familiarized direction are rated as less familiar. Conceiving of statistical learning over trajectories through perceptual space explains the results under both conditions.",>Jason Zevin>Hao Wang,">University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA>University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0680/index.html

2012,"Women in Cognitive Science sponsored interactive panel discussion: Professional advancement, leadership and international collaboration","Women in Cognitive Science conducts panels at yearly meetings of several professional societies. Their goal is to increase attention to the situation of women cognitive scientists, to better understand the reasons for existing problems of under representation in key positions, and to provide a forum for professional development that encourages both junior and senior scientists to consider the ways in which they might work with their own home institutions to effect change. Specific topics have addressed networking and collaboration, best practices for institutional transformation, and issues of family and academic careers. Speakers and panelists have included both women and men who represented senior and junior scientists and topics have focused on the experience of both faculty and administration in negotiating these issues and in developing policies that are likely to support women’s success. Its history demonstrates that WICS is in a unique position to address the concerns of junior as well as senior scientists in their professional careers.",>Laurie Beth Feldman>Janet van Hell>Judith Kroll>Suparna Rajaram,>University of Albany>Pennsylvania State University>Pennsylvania State University>Stony Brook University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0001/index.html
2012,"Teleoperated Android as a Tool for Cognitive Studies, Communication and Art","Teleoperated androids are robots owning humanlike appearance equipped with semi-autonomous teleoperation facility. Since their birth, Geminoids and Telenoids have been used in a variety of domains throughout the world, from studies in various fields such as in cognitive psychology / neuroscience, social psychiatry, developmental psychology, robotics, and human-machine interface to philosophy and art. One example is the android drama which showed new possibilities on not only on usage for teleoperated android robots but for artistic representations as well as seeking purity in the natures of human beings. In this workshop, we will focus on the further enhanced and broadened usage of teleoperated androids that can provide new means for cognitive science studies, and can bridge the gap between cognitive neuroscience and the behavioral sciences, as well as philosophy, social science and arts, leading to a new way of understanding human beings.",>Shuichi Nishio>Hiroshi Ishiguro,">ATR, Japan>Osaka University, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0002/index.html
2012,Modeling the Perception of Intentions,"Attributing intentions to others based on observations of their behavior is a core cognitive ability. It is also a necessary precursor to social judgments such as judgments about responsibility and morality. The seminal work of Heider and Simmel (1944) highlighted the spontaneity, richness, and range of intention attributions that can be elicited by a stimulus as impoverished as moving geometric figures. Subsequent research has revealed a wide range of visuospatial cues that suggest specific intentions as well as observer attributes that influence judgments. How are such cues and observer attributes integrated into an inferred specific intention? A handful of processing models have used frameworks such as schema-matching or probabilistic inference to integrate such cues. This workshop will address two questions: 1) How have different fundamental paradigms fared in the quest for a model of human intention perception? and 2) What questions about this topic are most in need of answers?",>Barbara Tversky>Shimon Ullman>Dare Baldwin>Frank E.

2012,And Now for Something Completely Different: Python in Cognitive Science,"The objective of this tutorial is to introduce and motivate the use of the Python programming language in cognitive science research. Within the last 10 years, the development of scientific and numerical libraries in Python has grown to the point where Python can now be used as a scientific and numerical computing environment comparable to products like Matlab and Mathematica. As of yet, however, it appears that knowledge of the potential applications of Python to research in cognitive science is still rather limited. The aim of this tutorial, therefore, is to describe these areas of application and to advocate the advantages and appeals of using Python as the principal programming language in cognitive science research. Given the generality of the tools being discussed, it is hoped that this tutorial will have widespread appeal and relevance.",>Mark Andrews>Jesse Diaz,>Nottingham Trent University>Nottingham Trent University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0004/index.html
2012,Full day tutorial on Quantum models of cognition and decision,"This full day tutorial is an exposition of a rapidly growing new alternative approach to building computational models of cognition and decision based on quantum theory. Quantum theory provides a fundamentally different approach to logic, reasoning, probabilistic inference, and dynamical systems. For example, quantum logic does not follow the distributive axiom of Boolean logic; quantum probabilities do not obey the disjunctive axiom of Kolmogorov probability; quantum reasoning does not obey the principle of monotonic reasoning. It turns out that humans do not obey these restrictions either, which is why we consider a quantum approach. This tutorial will provide an exposition of the basic assumptions of classic versus quantum information processing theories. These basic assumptions will be examined, side by side, in a parallel and elementary manner.",>Jerome Busemeyer>Peter Bruza>Taiki Takahashi>Jennifer Trueblood,>Indiana University>Queensland University of Technology>Hokkaido University Japan>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0005/index.html
2012,Using Bayes to Interpret Non-significant Results,"The purpose of the tutorial is to present simple tools for dealing with non-significant results, an area which cognitive scientists have consistently found problematic. In particular, people will be taught how to apply Bayes Factors and likelihood intervals to draw meaningful inferences from non-significant data, using free easy-to-use on-line software: Software which allows one to determine whether there is strong evidence for the null and against one’s theory, or if the data are just insensitive, a distinction p_values cannot make. These tools have greater flexibility than power calculations and allow null results to be interpreted over a wider range of situations. Such tools should allow the publication of null results to become easier.",>Zoltan Dienes,">University of Sussex, Brighton, East Sussex, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0006/index.html
2012,Nengo and the Neural Engineering Framework: From Spikes to Cognition,"As we learn more about the neural activity underlying cognitive function, there is an increasing demand to explicitly and quantitatively connect cognitive theories to neurological details. Bridging these levels provides benefits in both directions; aspects of the cognitive theory can predict and be constrained by neurological details, and the neurological details can in turn identify important modifications to the overall cognitive theory.",>Chris Eliasmith>Terrence Stewart,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0007/index.html
2012,"Probability, programs, and the mind: Building structured Bayesian models of cognition","Human thought is remarkably flexible: we can think about infinitely many different situations despite uncertainty and novelty. Probabilistic models of cognition (Chater2006) have been successful at explaining a wide variety of learning and reasoning under uncertainty. They have borrowed tools from statistics and machine learning to explain phenomena from perception (Yuille2006) to language (Chater2006a). Traditional symbolic models (e.g. Newell1958, Anderson1998), by contrast, excel at explaining the productivity of thought, which follows from compositionality of symbolic representations. Indeed, there has been a gradual move toward more structured probabilistic models (Tenenbaum2011) that incorporate aspects of symbolic methods into probabilistic modeling. Unfortunately this movement has resulted in a complex ""zoo"" of Bayesian models. We have recently introduced the idea that using programs, and particularly probabilistic programs, as the representational substrate for probabilistic modeling tames this unruly zoo, fully unifies probabilistic with symbolic approaches, and opens new possibilities in cognitive modeling. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce probabilistic models of cognition from the point of view of probabilistic programming, both as a unifying idea for cognitive modeling and as a practical tool.",>Noah Goodman>Joshua Tenenbaum,>Stanford University>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0008/index.html
2012,Using Machine Learning for Exploratory Data Analysis,"This tutorial will introduce attendees to fundamental concepts in the clustering and dimensionality reduction fields of unsupervised machine learning. Attendees will learn about the assumptions algorithms make and how those assumptions can cause the algorithms to be more or less suited to particular datasets. Hands-on interaction with machine learning algorithms on real and synthetic data are a central component of this tutorial. Students will use the software platform Divvy (freely available from the Mac App Store or divvy.ucsd.edu) to visualize and analyze data in real time while testing the concepts learned during formal instruction. We encourage attendees to bring their Mac laptops and their own datasets for the hands-on portion of the tutorial, and if possible to email their datasets ahead of time to josh@cogsci.ucsd.edu. Attendees will leave the tutorial with a much better understanding of basic concepts in unsupervised machine learning. Pragmatically they will understand when to apply, e.g., k-means to a dataset versus single linkage clustering. Attendees will also learn how to integrate Divvy into their existing research workflow so that they can quickly test and compare machine learning algorithms on their data.",>Joshua Lewis>Virginia de Sa,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0009/index.html
2012,Practical Advice on How to Run Human Behavioral Studies,"The lack of materials on the details of running human experiments can lead to a gap between theory and practice, which is particularly acute in cognitive science done outside of psychology depart¬ments. Conse¬quently, labs frequently must not only impart these practical skills to students infor¬mally but also must address misun¬derstandings arising from this divorce of theory and practice in their formal education. Researchers in psychology often end up appalled by the lack of this common but undocu¬mented sense when behavioral research is reported by researchers outside of psychology. This tutorial provides practical advice on how to run studies for beginning students and researchers coming starting to run studies.",>Frank Ritter>Jong kim,>psu>UCF,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0010/index.html
2012,Robotics and Emotion,"Robotics studies have developed at many places across the globe and explored many different approaches. Among others, Japan has been one of the leading countries promoting robotics studies, breaking new ground with establishing Human Robot Interaction as an international society and leading the world with very human-like Geminoids. In the 1940’s, Masanao Toda, a founder of cognitive science in Japan, proposed a visionary robotic system to explore and understand the function of emotion as a trigger of cognitive mechanisms for survival. For example, when a human was exploring in the ancient wilderness, fear must have worked as a switch between the exploratory mode and the find-an-escape mode to promote survival. The thought-experimental robot, the Fungus Eater, seeded some of the early AI research when it was introduced to psychologists in the U.S. and the Netherlands (Toda, 2000, 1982).",>Rolf Pfeifer>Hiroshi Ishiguro>Yuichiro Anzai>Naomi Miyake,">University of Zurich>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science>The University of Tokyo",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0011/index.html
2012,Computational Models of Intuitive Physics,"People have a powerful “physical intelligence” – an ability to infer physical properties of objects and predict future states in complex, dynamic scenes – which they use to interpret their surroundings, plan safe and effective actions, build and understand devices and machines, and communicate efficiently. For instance, you can choose where to place your coffee to prevent it from spilling, arrange books in a stable stack, judge the relative weights of objects after watching them collide, and construct systems of levers and pulleys to manipulate heavy objects. These behaviors suggest that the mind relies on a sophisticated physical reasoning system, and for decades cognitive scientists have been interested in the content of this knowledge, how it is used and how it is acquired. In the last few years, there has been exciting progress in answering these questions in formal computational terms, with the maturation of several different traditions of cognitive modeling that have independently come to take intuitive physics as a central object of study. The goals of this symposium are to: 1) highlight these recent computational developments, focusing chiefly on qualitative reasoning (QR) models and Bayesian perceptual and cognitive models; 2) begin a dialog between leading proponents of these different approaches, discussing a number of dimensions along which the approaches appear to differ and working towards bridging those differences; 3) enrich these models with perspectives from empirical work in cognitive science.",>Peter Battaglia>Tomer Ullman>Joshua Tenenbaum>Adam Sanborn>Kenneth Forbus>Tobias Gerstenberg>David Lagnado,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of Warwick>Northwestern University>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0012/index.html
2012,"The role of comparison in structure learning: Developmental, learning science, and computational perspectives","The ability to perceive, comprehend and reason about relations (i.e., relational thinking) is central in human cognition. Relational thinking is powerful because it is structured. Specifically, relational thought allows inferences and generalizations that are constrained by the roles that elements play, rather than strictly the properties of the elements themselves. The role of relational comparisons in learning is emerging as an important area of developmental and learning science research. Relational comparisons allow learners to derive symbolic, abstract, and conceptual knowledge representations that are generative, in that children and adults can then use them broadly in new contexts to reason about new elements. Indeed, comparison seems to underlie the very development of the structured relational representations that underlie relational cognition. This symposium aims to bring to together research on the role of comparison in developmental and adult learning. Specifically, we present research on the role of comparison in the development of spatial reasoning, language learning, adult mathematics learning, and computational approaches to learning structured (i.e., symbolic) representations.",>Stella Christie>Dedre Gentner>Mutsumi Imai>Etsuko Haryu>Hiroyuki Okada>Ji Y.

2012,Thirty years of Marr's Vision: Levels of Analysis in Cognitive Science,"Thirty years after Marr’s landmark posthumous book, Vision (Marr, 1982), the argument for which he is most cited remains the distinction between computational, algorithmic and representational, and the implementation levels. In the interim, many reformulations of this basic distinction have been proposed, but is it still relevant? This symposium will discuss whether there is still a place for the algorithmic and representational level, with its cognitive-level concepts, given the rise in reductionist neuroscience from below and Bayesian analysis from above.",>Chris Eliasmith>Tom Griffiths>Valerie Gray Hardcastle>Brad Love>William Bechtel>Richard P.

2012,New Frontiers in Computational Models of Grammatical Development,"How children acquire the grammar of their native language has been a central topic in cognitive science since its outset, and has been the focus of much debate. One view assumed an innate Universal Grammar which genetically endowed the child with highly structured knowledge of language (Chomsky, 1965). An opposing position argued against both the assumptions of innate knowledge and structured representations, instead using connectionist architectures with distributed representations to learn grammatical patterns (e.g., Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986).",>Micah Goldwater>Scott Friedman>Dedre Gentner>Kenneth Forbus>Cynthia Fisher>Michael Connor>Dan Roth>Franklin Chang>Gary Dell,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Liverpool>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0016/index.html

2012,Governing Board Symposium: Cognitive Science and the Learning Sciences,"The focus of the symposium is on real world implementations of educational innovations based on cognitive and learning science principles and research. These real world implementations can be in physical classrooms, on-line courses, informal educational settings, as well as other learning environments. The innovations can include new ways of conceptualizing and presenting a domain, computer-based multimedia learning tools, and other innovations. The common thread though is that these innovations are beyond lab-testing and are guided by principles and research from the cognitive and learning sciences.

2012,How Vertical Spaces Are Perceived and Represented,"The purpose of this symposium is to highlight how the vertical dimension is perceived and represented differently from the horizontal dimensions, and the role of this dimension in spatial learning. This is a new and important issue because literature on spatial cognition has hitherto neglected the study of the vertical dimension, under the assumption that space can identically be investigated in the horizontal plane. This notion, while untested, ignores a crucial, unique property of the vertical dimension – that of being parallel to the force of gravity, which poses constraints on affordances and energetic potential. Additionally, the ability to move freely in three dimensions imposes computational complexities not present in two. New research impetus is trying to clarify the role of the vertical dimension in space. The present symposium will try to tie together different perspectives (psychophysics, cognition, neurophysiology), using different animal models (human and non-human), and different experimental methods (real and virtual environments), in order to provide a synthetic view on this issue, and to establish future goals of common interest. We focus here on two aspects of three-dimensional space: surface properties (e.g., hills and valleys) and volumetric properties.",>Daniele Nardi>Frank Durgin>Kate Jeffery>Steven Weisberg,">Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy>Swarthmore College, PA, USA>University College London, UK>Temple University, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0019/index.html
2012,What Can Cognitive Science Say or Learn about Economic Crises?,"Economic crises bring to the fore deep issues for the economic profession: why are such crises often not foreseen, and what does this entail for economic theory? In this symposium we also adopt a self-critical analysis, by asking the following: what can the cognitive science community say or learn about cognition and behavior in the context of economic crises? After all, cognitive science shares one of its principle objectives with economics: to investigate and model the principles that underlie and govern human behavior.",>Magda Osman>Björn Meder>Gerd Gigerenzer>Nick Chater>Daniel Read>Hansjörg Neth,>Queen Mary University of London>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Warwick Business School>Warwick Business School>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0020/index.html
2012,"Dynamic decision making: neuronal, computational, and cognitive underpinnings","As complexity in our everyday environment increases (e.g., mobile applications for monitoring energy consumption), how do we adapt and react to the changing demands placed on us? In dynamic decision making (DDM) problems, the environment changes over time due to previous decisions made and/or factors outside the control of the decision-maker. To maximize his/her reward, an agent effectively needs to control a complex dynamic system. This often involves planning in the face of uncertainty about how decisions change the state of the system and the rewards that can be obtained. Thus, DDM refers to a process by which an agent selects a course of action in a manner that achieves or maintains a desired state in a dynamic environment. This includes balancing exploration and exploitation, distinguishing between different sources of variability within the environment, and tracking the current state of the environment (i.e., filtering).",>Magda Osman>Maarten Speekenbrink>Peter Dayan>Masataka Watanabe>Nigel Harvey,>Queen Mary University of London>University College London>University College London>Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0021/index.html
2012,Grammatical Approaches to Written and Graphical Communication,"The notion of mental grammar has been at the heart of linguistic theorizing for much of the past century. The arguments for the existence of grammar, a set of mental rules/constraints governing the well-formedness of linguistic structures, are vast and varied, however the central argument that has been made in its favor is that speakers are capable of producing (and understanding) an infinite set of systematically structured words (phonology, morphology) and utterances (syntax).",>Colin Wilson>Neil Cohn>James Myers>Stephen Goldberg>Ariel Cohen-Goldberg,">Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD>Tufts University, Medford, MA>National Chung Cheng University, Minhsiung, Chiayi, Taiwan>Hamilton College, Clinton, NY>Tufts University, Medford, MA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0022/index.html
2012,Constructing a hypothesis space from the Web for large-scale Bayesian word learning,"The Bayesian generalization framework has been successful in explaining how people generalize a property from a few observed stimuli to novel stimuli, across several different domains. To create a successful Bayesian generalization model, modelers typically specify a hypothesis space and prior probability distribution for each specific domain. However, this raises two problems: the models do not scale beyond the (typically small-scale) domain that they were designed for, and the explanatory power of the models is reduced by their reliance on a hand-coded hypothesis space and prior. To solve these two problems, we propose a method for deriving hypothesis spaces and priors from large online databases. We evaluate our method by constructing a hypothesis space and prior for a Bayesian word learning model from WordNet, a large online database that encodes the semantic relationships between words as a network. After validating our approach by replicating a previous word learning study, we apply the same model to a new experiment featuring three additional taxonomic domains (clothing, containers, and seats). In both experiments, we found that the same automatically constructed hypothesis space explains the complex pattern of generalization behavior, producing accurate predictions across a total of six different domains.",>Joshua Abbott>Joseph Austerweil>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0023/index.html
2012,Predicting focal colors with a rational model of representativeness,"Best examples of categories lie at the heart of two major debates in cognitive science, one concerning universal focal colors across languages, and the other concerning the role of representativeness in inference. Here we link these two debates. We show that best examples of named color categories across 110 languages are well-predicted by a rational model of representativeness, and that this model outperforms several natural competitors. We conclude that categorization in the contested semantic domain of color may be governed by general principles that apply more broadly in cognition, and that these principles clarify the interplay of universal and language-specific forces in color naming.",>Joshua Abbott>Terry Regier>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0024/index.html
2012,Gestures in Communication through Line Graphs,"Line graphs are widely used in communication settings, for conveying information about states and processes that unfold in time. The communication is achieved by the contribution of other modalities than graphs, such as language and gestures. In a set of experimental investigations, we analyzed the production and comprehension of gestures during communication through line graphs. The findings reveal a systematic use of gestures as well as the limitations of cognitive resources due to the split of attention between the modalities.",>Cengiz Acarturk>Ozge Alacam,">Cognitive Science, Informatics Institute, Middle East Technical University, Turkey>Cognitive Science, Informatics Institute, Middle East Technical University, Turkey",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0025/index.html
2012,Distributional Learning of Vowel Categories Is Supported by Prosody in Infant-Directed Speech,"Infants' acquisition of phonetic categories involves a distributional learning mechanism that operates on acoustic dimensions of the input. However, natural infant-directed speech shows large degrees of phonetic variability, and the resulting overlap between categories suggests that category learning based on distributional clustering may not be feasible without constraints on the learning process, or exploitation of other sources of information. The present study examines whether mothers' prosodic modifications within infant-directed speech help the distributional learning of vowel categories. Specifically, we hypothesize that `motherese' provides the infant with a subset of high-quality learning tokens that improve category learning. In an analysis of vowel tokens taken from natural mother-infant interactions, we found that prosody can be used to distinguish high-quality tokens (with expanded formant frequencies) from low-quality tokens in the input. Moreover, in simulations of distributional learning we found that models trained on this small set of high-quality tokens provide better classification than models trained on the complete set of tokens. Taken together, these findings show that distributional learning of vowel categories can be improved by attributing importance to tokens that are prosodically prominent in the input. The prosodic properties of motherese might thus be a helpful cue for infants in supporting phonetic category learning.",>Frans Adriaans>Daniel Swingley,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0026/index.html
2012,Emotion-Based Reinforcement Learning,"Studies have shown that counterfactual reasoning can shape human decisions. However, there is a gap in the literature between counterfactual choices in description-based and experience-based paradigms. While studies using description-based paradigms suggest participants maximize expected subjective emotion, studies using experience-based paradigms assume that participants learn the values of options and select what maximizes expected utility. In this study, we used computational modeling to test 1) whether participants make emotion-based decisions in experience-based paradigms, and 2) whether the impact of regret depends on its degree of unexpectedness as suggested by the current regret theory. The results suggest that 1) participants make emotion-based choices even in experience-based paradigms, and 2) the impact of regret is greater when it is expected than when it is unexpected. These results challenge the current theory of regret and suggest that reinforcement learning models may need to use counterfactual value functions when full information is provided.",>Woo-Young Ahn>Olga Rass>Yong-Wook Shin>Jerome R.

2012,Cooperation in risky environments: Decisions from experience in a stochastic social dilemma,"Often in cooperative situations, many aspects of the decision-making environment are uncertain. We investigate how cooperation is shaped by the way information about risk is presented (from description or from experience) and by differences in risky environments. Drawing on research from risky choice, we compare choices in stochastic social dilemmas to those in lotteries with equivalent levels of risk. Cooperation rates in games vary with different levels of risk across decision situations with the same expected outcomes, thereby mimicking behavior in lotteries. Risk presentation, however, only affected choices in lotteries, not in stochastic games. Process data suggests that people respond less to probabilities in the stochastic social dilemmas than in the lotteries. The findings highlight how an uncertain environment shapes cooperation and call for models of the underlying decision processes.",>Florian Artinger>Nadine Fleischhut>Vittoria Levati>Jeffrey R.

2012,Modeling individual differences in socioeconomic game playing,"Game theory has been useful for understanding risk-taking and cooperative behavior. In the present study, subjects played the Hawk-Dove game with simulated and embodied (robotic) neural agents which used a neurobiologically plausible model of action selection and adaptive behaviors. Subjects had their serotonin levels temporarily altered through acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). The traditional assumption for subject data from Game-theory-ATD or human robot interaction (HRI) studies is that all participants come from the same underlying distribution or same group. We used probabilistic graphical models in order to determine potential sub-group affiliations based on the subjects’ responses while playing the Hawk-Dove game. The results from the models indicate sub-groups within a subject population exist. We find that two-group, one that tends toward cooperation and the other that tends toward aggression, best describes the effect of subject behavior in response to ATD and embodiment.",>Derrik Asher>Shunan Zhang>Andrew Zaldivar>Michael Lee>Jeffrey Krichmar,">Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine>Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine>Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine>Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine>Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0029/index.html
2012,Lexical Access Across Languages: A Multinomial Model of Auditory Distraction,"Recall in many types of verbal memory task is reliably disrupted by the presence of auditory distracters, with verbal distracters frequently proving the most disruptive (Beaman, 2005). A multinomial processing tree model (Schweickert, 1993) is applied to the effects on free recall of background speech from a known or an unknown language. The model reproduces the free recall curve and the impact on memory of verbal distracters for which a lexical entry exists (i.e., verbal items from a known language). The effects of semantic relatedness of distracters within a language is found to depend upon a redintegrative factor thought to reflect the contribution of the speech-production system. The differential impacts of known and unknown languages cannot be accounted for in this way, but the same effects of distraction are observed amongst bilinguals, regardless of distracter-language.",>Philip Beaman,>University of Reading,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0030/index.html

2012,Route choice in individuals—semantic network navigation,"In a novel experimental task, individuals are asked to navigate from a goal word to an end word through a semantic network. In this forced choice task, individuals perform with a high success rate (73%) and frequently navigate to the target in the minimal number of required step (22%). We utilize these experimental results to explore different search and decision strategies. Our modeling results suggest individuals are not guessing at random (or utilizing only local information) and that knowledge of the global structure is necessary for individuals to succeed. We further show that a latent semantic space model, such as word association space, can capture much of the global semantic knowledge necessary to explain participant decisions. We suggest that performance in this task might shed light on the underlying structure of memory and more importantly search within memory.",>Nicole Beckage>Mark Steyvers>Carter Butts,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0032/index.html
2012,Competent Deontic Reasoning: The Abstract Deontic Selection Task Revisited,"The abstract deontic selection task was developed with the aim of demonstrating abstract rule use in a specific domain (i.e., deontic rules). Yet, the solution rate, while being substantially higher than with abstract non-deontic tasks, did not reach the level obtained with concrete deontic tasks. What are the reasons for this—difficulties with abstract rule use? A task analysis based on deontic principles uncovers several problems with the formulation of the task. Three experiments replicate the difficulties with the original task and show that performance increases, when the problems are resolved. The results provide novel insights into the interpretation of deontic rules and into the role that such content-specific, but abstract tasks can play for the study of reasoning processes.",>Sieghard Beller>Andrea Bender,">Center for Interdisciplinary Research (ZiF), Bielefeld University, Germany>University of Freiburg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0033/index.html
2012,That's what she (could have) said: How alternative utterances affect language use,"We investigate the effects of alternative utterances on pragmatic interpretation of language. We focus on two specific cases: specificity implicatures (less specific utterances imply the negation of more specific utterances) and Horn implicatures (more complex utterances are assigned to less likely meanings). We present models of these phenomena in terms of recursive social reasoning. Our most sophisticated model is not only able to handle specificity implicature but is also the first formal account of Horn implicatures that correctly predicts human behavior in signaling games with no prior conventions, without appeal to specialized equilibrium selection criteria. Two experiments provide evidence that these implicatures are generated in the absence of prior linguistic conventions or language evolution. Taken together, our modeling and experimental results suggest that the pragmatic effects of alternative utterances can be driven by cooperative social reasoning.",>Leon Bergen>Noah Goodman>Roger Levy,>MIT BCS>Stanford Psychology>UCSD Linguistics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0034/index.html
2012,Word predictability and frequency effects in a rational model of reading,"This paper presents results from the first rational model of eye movement control in reading to make predictions for the full range of the eye movement record. The model identifies the text through Bayesian inference and makes eye movement decisions to maximize the efficiency of text identification, going beyond leading approaches which select model parameters to maximize the fit to human data. Two simulations with the model demonstrate that it can produce effects of word predictability and frequency on eye movements in reading similar to those produced by humans, providing evidence that many properties of human reading behavior may be understood as following from the nature of efficient text identification.",>Klinton Bicknell>Roger Levy,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0035/index.html

2012,Inducing Mathematical Concepts from Specific Examples: The Role of Schema-Level Variation,"Previous research suggests that comparing multiple specific examples of a general concept can promote knowledge transfer. The present study investigated whether this approach could be made more effective by systematic variation in the semantic content of the specific examples. Participants received instruction in a mathematical concept in the context of several examples, which instantiated either a single semantic schema (non-varied condition) or two different schemas (varied condition). Schema-level variation during instruction led to better knowledge transfer, as predicted. However, this advantage was limited to participants with relatively high performance before instruction. Variation also improved participants’ ability to describe the target concept in abstract terms. Surprisingly, however, this ability was not associated with successful knowledge transfer.",>David Braithwaite>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0037/index.html
2012,Learning to recognize unfamiliar voices: the role of language familiarity and music experience,"Speech not only transmits semantic information through words and syntax, but also provides cues to a talker’s identity. Differences in a listener’s ability to recognize voices can be attributed to their language background, and in rare cases voice recognition can be selectively damaged in neurological patients. In this study we investigated a group of Korean- English bilinguals and non-Korean speakers’ ability to learn to recognize unfamiliar Korean and English talkers by voice, and to generalize to utterances not heard during training. We observed an interaction between language background and stimulus language for speed of learning, however generalization performance indicated no such interaction when compared to baseline performance. Bilinguals’ performance recognizing English (but not Korean) voices, was predicted by the age they learned English. We also observed that individuals who actively participated in music production exhibited significantly faster task learning than those who did not produce music. This study indicates that language background has a gradient effect on voice learning among bilinguals, and that non-linguistic auditory processing differences, such as music perception, impact voice identification.",>Micah Bregman>Sarah Creel,">UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0038/index.html

However, little consideration has been given as to whether some misconceptions manifest more frequently in one domain than another, or take on a different character depending on the agents or phenomenon involved. We examined participants' explanations of emergent phenomena from three domains. We found significant differences between domains, showing greater or lesser evidence of misconceptions. We propose that that novices bring prior knowledge, folk psychology, and folk biology to bear in determining the capabilities of the agents involved in a phenomenon, and that these beliefs guide their explanations. We believe that the study of how people perceive emergence would benefit from drawing upon research on folk theories, anthropomorphism, developmental constraints, and other areas that will help us understand how learners characterize agents, environments, and their interactions.",>Sarah Brem>Glenda Stump>Gale Sinatra>Raymond Reichenberg>Benjamin Heddy,">Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States>Arizona State University>University of Southern California>Arizona State University>University of Southern California",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0039/index.html
2012,Do I know that you know what you know? Modeling testimony in causal inference,"We rely on both our own observations and on others' testimony when making causal inferences. To integrate these sources of information we must consider an informant's statements about the world, her expressed level of certainty, her previous accuracy, and perhaps her apparent self-knowledge -- how accurately she conveys her own certainty. It can be difficult to tease apart the contributions of all these variables simply by observing people's causal judgments. We present a computational account of how these different cues contribute to a rational causal inference, and two experiments looking at adults' inferences from causal demonstrations and informant testimony, focusing on cases where these sources conflict. We find that adults are able to combine social information with their own observations, and are sensitive to the reliability of each. Adults are also sensitive to the accuracy, certainty, and self-knowledge of the informant, a result confirmed by comparing predictions from models with and without these variables.",>Daphna Buchsbaum>Sophie Bridgers>Andrew Whalen>Elizabeth Seiver>Tom Griffiths>Alison Gopnik,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0040/index.html

To study this system, Sholl, Kenny, and DellaPorta (2006) developed a heading-recall task and found that task accuracy correlated highly with self-reported SOD measures. This study attempts to replicate and extend their findings, by increasing task accuracy, and testing alternative hypotheses about factors that could affect task performance. In a heading-recall task, participants estimated allocentric heading from pictures of familiar locations on a college campus. Previous results were replicated, but a weaker relationship between SOD and performance, and a novel relationship between location familiarity and performance were found. These results provide support for a human allocentric heading system but suggest that self-reported SOD potentially measures a range of abilities and not solely the operation of this system.",>Heather Burte>Mary Hegarty,">University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0041/index.html

Is time mapped metaphorically onto space, or do the two domains share a common representational format? In the present paper, participants touched (but could not see) physical sticks while listening to an auditory note. Judgements of stick length were affected by concurrent note duration, but not vice versa. When participants were allowed to see as well as touch the sticks, however, the effects reversed. These findings run counter to the spatial metaphor account of time, which claims that effects of space on time should always be stronger than those of time on space. Rather, our findings support the spatial representation account, in which time and space share a common neural substrate that may be affected by concurrent temporal or spatial information, depending on the perceptual acuity of the modality used to perceive space.",>Zhenguang Cai>Louise Connell,>University of Manchester>University of Manchester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0042/index.html
2012,Sentic Panalogy: Swapping Affective Common Sense Reasoning Strategies and Foci,"An important difference between traditional AI systems and human intelligence is our ability to harness common sense knowledge gleaned from a lifetime of learning and experiences to inform our decision-making and behavior. This allows humans to adapt easily to novel situations where AI fails catastrophically for lack of situation-specific rules and generalization capabilities. In order for machines to exploit common sense knowledge in reasoning as humans do, moreover, we need to endow them with human-like reasoning strategies. In problem-solving situations, in particular, several analogous representations of the same problem should be maintained in parallel while trying to solve it so that, when problem-solving begins to fail while using one representation, the system can switch to one of the others. Sentic panalogy is a technique that aims to emulate such process by exploiting graph-mining and dimensionality-reduction techniques to dynamically interchange both different reasoning strategies and the foci around which such strategies are developed.",>Erik Cambria>Daniel Olsher>Kenneth Kwok,>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0043/index.html

The inverse reasoning account proposes that inferences of this kind are carried out by postulating unobserved causes that best support the forward inference from causes to effects. We evaluated the inverse reasoning account by asking people to reason about hidden attractors and repellers that caused an observed particle to move about an arena. We found that people often evaluated specific hypotheses in a manner consistent with the inverse reasoning account but that hypothesis discovery involved processes that were inconsistent with inverse reasoning.,>Christopher Carroll>Charles Kemp,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0044/index.html
2012,Category structure modulates interleaving and blocking advantage in inductive category acquisition,"Research in inductive category learning has demonstrated that interleaving exemplars of categories results in better performance than presenting each category in a separate block. Two experiments indicate that the advantage of interleaved over blocked presentation is modulated by the structure of the categories being presented. More specifically, interleaved presentation results in better performance for categories with high within- and between-category similarity while blocked presentation results in better performance for categories with low within- and between-category similarity. This interaction is predicted by accounts in which blocking promotes discovery of features shared by the members of a category whereas interleaving promotes discovery of features that discriminate between categories.",>Paulo Carvalho>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0045/index.html

We assessed participants’ awareness of the stress rule by verbal reports, confidence rating and a novel methodology: inclusion-exclusion production tasks adapted from Destrebecqz and Cleeremans (2001). Experiment 1 demonstrated the implicit learning of association between the ending phoneme and word stress and experiment 2 the implicit learning of a more abstract rule of stress placement.

2012,Generating Realistic Semantic Codes for Use in Neural Network Models,"Many psychologically interesting tasks (e.g., reading, lexical decision, semantic categorisation and synonym judgement) require the manipulation of semantic representations. To produce a good computational model of these tasks, it is important to represent semantic information in a realistic manner. This paper aimed to find a method for generating artificial semantic codes, which would be suitable for modelling semantic knowledge. The desired computational criteria for semantic representations included: (1) binary coding; (2) sparse coding; (3) fixed number of active units in a semantic vector; (4) scalable semantic vectors and (5) preservation of realistic internal semantic structure. Several existing methods for generating semantic representations were evaluated against the criteria. The correlated occurrence analogue to the lexical semantics (COALS) system (Rohde, Gonnerman & Plaut, 2006) was selected as the most suitable candidate because it satisfied most of the desired criteria. Semantic vectors generated from the COALS system were converted into binary representations and assessed on their ability to reproduce human semantic category judgements using stimuli from a previous study (Garrard, Lambon Ralph, Hodges & Patterson, 2001). Intriguingly the best performing sets of semantic vectors included 5 positive features and 15 negative features. Positive features are elements that encode the likely presence of a particular attribute whereas negative features encode its absence. These results suggest that including both positive and negative attributes generates a better category structure than the more traditional method of selecting only positive attributes.",>Ya-Ning Chang>Steve Furber>Stephen Welbourne,>Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit>Advanced Processor Technologies Group>Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0047/index.html

We also examined the effect of sharing the initial tonal syllable. A significant onset preparation effect and a significant syllable preparation effect were both observed. The latter was found to vary linearly with the number of segments in the syllable. The slope of 63 ms was similar to the 70-ms onset effect, suggesting that the syllable effect was segment-based. The results contrasted with the lack of an onset effect previously reported for speaking, and were interpreted as supporting the Output Constraint Hypothesis which states that the kind of outputs a production system is designed to produce (speaking vs. typing) can flexibly and adaptively alter the way the system is organized and operates.",>Jenn-Yeu Chen>Train-Min Chen,>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0048/index.html
2012,What Counts in Mandarin Chinese: A Study of Individuation and Quantification,"By some accounts, speakers of classifier languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which lack count-mass syntax, require classifiers to specify individuated meanings of nouns. This paper examines this view by testing how Mandarin speakers interpret bare nouns and use classifier knowledge to guide quantification in four experiments. Using a quantity judgment task, Experiment 1 found that Mandarin speakers interpret nouns like English speakers, regardless of their syntactic status as mass or count in English. Experiment 2 showed that Mandarin speakers quantified broken objects like English adults, again suggesting that Mandarin nouns specify criteria of individuation. Experiments 3 and 4 together showed that classifiers are not typically required for individuation, except when the reference of nouns is semantically ambiguous (e.g., rock, string) and can denote either objects or substances. In sum, we argue that individuation can be specified lexically in classifier languages like Mandarin, and does not depend on classifier syntax.",>Pierina Cheung>Peggy Li>David Barner,">University of Waterloo>Harvard University>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0049/index.html
2012,The Role of Preview and Incremental Delivery on Visual Search,"Recent studies show that visual search often involves a combination of both parallel and serial search strategies. Consequently, computational models and theoretical accounts of visual search processing have evolved from traditional parallel or serial descriptions to a continuum from “efficient” to “inefficient.” In our first experiments (1a & 1b), we demonstrate with various conditions that search efficiency does not increase with simultaneous delivery of target features in a conjunction-search task. In the second experiment, we explore effects of incremental non-linguistic information delivery and discover improvement of search efficiency. We find a facilitatory effect when non-linguistic visual delivery of target features is concurrent with the visual display onset, but not when the target features are delivered prior to display onset. The results support an interactive account of visual perception that explains linguistic and non-linguistic mediation of visual search as chiefly due to the incrementality of target feature delivery once search has begun.",>Eric Chiu>Michael Spivey,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0050/index.html

2012,Subject Relative Production in SLI Children during Syntactic Priming and Sentence Repetition,"Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLIC) experience difficulties in processing Subject relative clauses (SRC). This has been interpreted as evidence that they lack syntactic representations for SRC. Our study investigates the spontaneous production of SRC in typically developing children (TDC) and SLIC in a structural priming paradigm, and compares their performance in a sentence repetition task. We demonstrate that SLIC are much more likely to produce SRC during priming than in sentence repetition; moreover, when primed, their performance matches TDC's baseline (unprimed) performance. Furthermore, we design two simple unsupervised Bayesian models, and predict the developmental group (SLI, TD) and priming condition (Primed, Non-Primed). Overall, this study shows that SLIC can spontaneously produce SRC when primed, suggesting their impairment is related to working memory, rather than a deficit in syntactic knowledge.",>Moreno Coco>Maria Garraffa>Holly Branigan,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0052/index.html
2012,Segmenting Visual Narratives: Evidence for Constituent Structure in Comics,"We have proposed that visual narratives in comics are organized with a hierarchic narrative “grammar.” Inspired by classic “click” studies of syntax, we inserted blank “disruption” panels Before, At, or After the constituent boundaries of comic strips. In self-paced viewing, Experiment 1 found that blanks After the boundary were viewed slower than Before or At the boundary. Panels immediately following blanks were slower than corresponding panels in sequences without blank panels, but only when placed Before or After the boundary. Three ordinal panel positions following the boundary, panels following blanks At the boundary or with No-Blanks were viewed faster than panels following blanks After or Before the boundary. This supports constituency because disruptions had greater impact within, as opposed to between, constituents. Using ERPs, Experiment 2 found a larger anterior negativity to blanks within constituents (Before/After) than between constituents (At). This indicates disruptions of constituents are recognized before reaching a subsequent panel. A larger P600 appeared to blanks After the boundary than in the first constituent (Before/At). This positivity may reflect a reanalysis reflecting the inability to integrate all prior panels into a single constituent, since they are divided by the constituent boundary.",>Neil Cohn>Phillip Holcomb>Ray Jackendoff>Gina Kuperberg,>Tufts University>Tufts University>Tufts University>Tufts University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0053/index.html
2012,Framing attention in American and Japanese comics,"Research has shown that Americans focus more on focal objects of a scene while East Asians attend to the surrounding environment (Nisbett, 2003; Nisbett & Miyamoto, 2005). The panels of comic books—the sequential frames of images—highlight aspects of a scene comparably to how attention focuses on parts of a spatial array. Thus, comparison of American and Japanese comics can inform cross-cultural cognition by looking at the expressive mediums produced by these cultures. We compared the framing of figures and scenes in the panels of two genres of American comics (Independent and Mainstream) with mainstream Japanese “manga.” Both genres of American comics focused on whole scenes as much as individual characters, while Japanese manga individuated characters and parts of scenes. We argue that this framing of space in comics simulates a viewer’s integration of a visual scene, and is consistent with cross-cultural differences in the direction of attention.",>Neil Cohn>Amaro Taylor-Weiner>Suzanne Grossman,>Tufts University>Tufts University>Tufts University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0054/index.html
2012,Early-Talker and Late-Talker Toddlers and Networks Show Different Word Learning Biases,"In typical development, word learning goes from slow and laborious to fast and seemingly effortless. Typically developing 2-year-olds are so skilled at learning noun categories that they seem to intuit the whole range of things in the category from hearing a single instance named – they are biased learners. This is not the case for children below the 20th percentile on productive vocabulary (late talkers). This paper looks at the individual vocabularies and word-learning biases of late- and early-talking toddlers. Experiment 1 shows that neural networks trained on the vocabularies of individual late talkers learn qualitatively different biases than those trained on early talker vocabularies. Experiment 2 confirms the novel predictions made by the simulations about word learning biases in late- vs. early-talking children.

While pitch may be described in spatial terms such as “high” or “low”, it is unclear whether pitch and space are associated but separate dimensions or whether they share representational and processing resources. In the present study, we asked participants to judge whether a target vocal note was the same as (or different from) a preceding cue note. Importantly, target trials were presented as video clips where a singer sometimes gestured upward or downward while singing that target note, thus providing an alternative, concurrent source of spatial information. Our results show that pitch discrimination was significantly biased by the spatial movement in gesture. These effects were eliminated by spatial memory load but preserved under verbal memory load conditions. Together, our findings suggest that pitch and space have a shared representation such that the mental representation of pitch is audiospatial in nature.",>Louise Connell>Zhenguang Cai>Judith Holler,">University of Manchester>University of Manchester>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0056/index.html

Using two conceptual combination tasks, we show that this linguistic shortcut is evident in both shallow and deep conceptual processing of novel stimuli. Specifically, in both shallow sensibility judgement and deep interpretation generation tasks, people use the linguistic shortcut as a “quick and dirty” guide to whether the concepts are likely to combine in a coherent situated simulation. Linguistic distributional frequency predicts both the likelihood and timecourse of rejecting a novel word compound as nonsensical or uninterpretable. However, it only predicts the timecourse of successful processing in shallow sensibility judgement because deeper interpretation generation requires conceptual processing in the simulation system.",>Louise Connell>Dermot Lynott,>University of Manchester>University of Manchester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0057/index.html

These assumptions are tested against empirically collected response time distributions. Evidence is found that sampling dynamics can change in response to instructions, and that both independent and correlated accumulators for ""old"" and ""new"" evidence are viable mechanisms for explaining accuracy and response time data.",>Gregory Cox>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0058/index.html
2012,Reverse appraisal: The importance of appraisals for the effect of emotion displays on people’s decision making in a social dilemma,"Two studies are presented that explore the interpersonal effect of emotion displays in decision making in a social dilemma. Experiment 1 (N=405) showed that facial displays of emotion (joy, sadness, anger and guilt) had an effect on perception of how the person was appraising the social dilemma outcomes (perception of appraisals) and on perception of how likely the person was to cooperate in the future (perception of cooperation). Experiment 1 also showed that perception of appraisals (partially and, in some cases, fully) mediated the effect of emotion displays on perception of cooperation. Experiment 2 (N=202) showed that manipulating perception of appraisals, by expressing them textually, produced an effect on perception of cooperation thus, providing evidence for a causal model where emotion displays cause perception of appraisals which, in turn, cause perception of cooperation. In line with Hareli and Hess’ (2010) findings and a social-functions view of emotion, we advance the reverse appraisal proposal that argues people can infer, from emotion displays, how others are appraising a situation which, in turn, support inferences that are relevant for decision making. We discuss implications of these results and proposal to decision and emotion theory.",>Celso de Melo>Jonathan Gratch>Peter Carnevale>Stephen Read,">Institute for Creative Technologies, USC>Institute for Creative Technologies, USC>Marshall School of Business, USC>Department of Psychology, USC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0059/index.html

The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) has been identified as a candidate region for this ability, but the specific processes to which the pSTS contributes remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the neural correlates of social perception using simple animated geometric shape stimuli, separately manipulating the perceived animacy, goal-directedness, and path rationality in the animations. We did not find an increased pSTS response to animate or goal-directed animations. However, we found that across conditions, the pSTS response tracked path rationality, with stronger responses to irrational paths. This is consistent with prior neuroimaging research on the perception of human actions, and supports the claim that the pSTS is involved in action understanding.",>Ben Deen>Rebecca Saxe,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0060/index.html

According to one theoretical account, even early in development, labels are category markers and are different from other features. According to another theory, early in development, labels are part of the input and are no more than other features. The current study addressed this issue by examining the effects of labels on category learning in 8- to 12- month infants. Infants were familiarized with exemplars from one category in either label-defined or motion-defined condition and then tested with prototypes from learned category and novel category. Eye tracking results indicated that infants exhibited better category learning in the motion-defined than in the label-defined condition.

The present investigation explores this notion in the auditory sensory modality. Participants listened to a stream of auditory sounds and spoken words with the instruction to detect repetitions in only the sound stream (i.e., ignore the words). A surprise test measured recognition for the previously played words. Overall, when comparing target-aligned and non-aligned information in a later recognition task, facilitation was observed for words that had been aligned with target repetitions, despite equal presentation frequency and being irrelevant to the primary repetition task. This enhancement was mediated by the sensory modality of presentation in the surprise recognition task. Congruent auditory presentations between the exposure and recognition tasks yielded improved performance, and under cross-modal presentations the magnitude of the enhancement was greatest.",>Andrew Dewald>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawai'i at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0063/index.html

Ideophones are a common feature in many of the world’s languages but are underdeveloped in English and other Indo-European languages. Here we study the meanings of ideophones in Siwu (a Kwa language from Ghana) using a pile-sorting task. The goal was to uncover the underlying structure of the lexical space and to examine the claimed link between ideophones and perception. We found that Siwu ideophones are principally organized around fine-grained aspects of sensory perception, and map onto salient psychophysical dimensions identified in sensory science. The results ratify ideophones as dedicated sensory vocabulary and underline the relevance of ideophones for research on language and perception.",>Mark Dingemanse>Asifa Majid,>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics ,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0064/index.html
2012,The Sound of Thickness: Prelinguistic Infants’ Associations of Space and Pitch,"People often talk about musical pitch in terms of spatial metaphors. In English, for instance, pitches can be high or low, whereas in other languages pitches are described as thick or thin. According to psychophysical studies, metaphors in language can also shape people’s nonlinguistic space-pitch representations. But does language establish mappings between space and pitch in the first place or does it modify preexisting associations? Here we tested 4-month-old Dutch infants’ sensitivity to height-pitch and thickness-pitch mappings in two preferential looking tasks. Dutch infants looked significantly longer at cross-modally congruent stimuli in both experiments, indicating that infants are sensitive to space-pitch associations prior to language. This early presence of space-pitch mappings suggests that these associations do not originate from language. Rather, language may build upon pre-existing mappings and change them gradually via some form of competitive associative learning.",>Sarah Dolscheid>Sabine Hunnius>Daniel Casasanto>Asifa Majid,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, NL>The New School for Social Research>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0065/index.html
2012,What explains variability in brain regions associate with Theory of Mind in a large sample of neurotypical adults and adults with ASD?,"Theory of mind (‘ToM’) tasks elicit highly reliable neural activity across individuals and experimental paradigms. We compared activity in a very large sample of neurotypical (‘NT’, N=477) individuals, and a group of high functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders (‘ASD’, n=27), using both region of interest (‘ROI’) and whole-brain analyses. Although ToM activity showed significant and reliable individual differences, these differences were not explained by participant gender or age, or most experimental parameters. Furthermore, there were no differences between ASD and NT individuals. These results imply that the social cognitive impairments typical of ASD can occur without gross changes in the size or response magnitude of ToM brain regions.",>Nicholas Dufour>Elizabeth Redcay>Liane Young>Penelope Mavros>Joseph Moran>Christina Triantafyllou>John Gabrieli>Rebecca Saxe,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States>University of Maryland

2012,Explanations of Counterfactual Inferences,"When engaging in counterfactual thought, people must imagine changes to the actual state of the world. In this study, participants made counterfactual inferences about a series of causal devices (i.e., they answered questions such as “If component A had not operated, would component B have operated?”) and provided explanations of their reasoning. Participants avoided breaking deterministic causal links (i.e., A always causes B), but were willing to break probabilistic causal links (i.e., A sometimes causes B) to keep prior causal events in the same states as in the actual world. Participants’ explanations of their reasoning were consistent with this pattern of inferences. Our results suggest that people use their explanation of the antecedent event (the “if” clause) to guide their counterfactual inferences. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for two rival Bayes-net theories of counterfactual reasoning (Pearl, 2000; Hiddleston, 2005).",>Brian Edwards>Lance Rips,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0067/index.html
2012,Learning Conceptual Hierarchies by Iterated Relational Consolidation,"Learning new concepts is critical to making sense of the world. Research on analogical reasoning suggests structure mapping and schema induction can enable discovery of new relational concepts. However, existing theories of schema induction and refinement are insufficient to explain acquisition of rich, compositional hierarchies of relational concepts. This paper offers a proposal for this sort of representation construction, founded on reinforcement learning to evaluate the predictive usefulness of higher-order relations, together with a mechanism of relational consolidation by which systems of relations (schemas) can be chunked into unitary entities. A computational model of these ideas is outlined and partially tested in simulations and human experiments. Implications and moderating factors for relational consolidation are considered.",>James Foster>Fabian Canas>Matt Jones,">University of Colorado, Boulder>University of Colorado, Boulder>University of Colorado, Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0068/index.html
2012,“Eyes Closed” and “Eyes Open” Expectations Guide Fixations in Real-World Search,"Investigations of search within realistic scenes have identified both bottom-up and top-down influences on performance. Here, I describe two types of top-down expectations that might guide observers looking for objects. Initially, likely locations can be predicted based only on the target identity but without any visual information from the scene (“Eyes closed”). When a visual preview becomes available, a more refined prediction can be made based on scene layout (“Eyes open”). In two experiments participants guessed the location of a target with or without a brief preview of the scene. Responses were consistent between observers and were used to predict the eye movements of new observers in a third experiment. The results confirm that participants use both types of top-down cues during search, and provide a simple method for estimating these expectations in predictive models.",>Tom Foulsham,>University of Essex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0069/index.html
2012,Maximum utility unitary coherent perception vs. the Bayesian brain,"Our subjective experience of the world is ‘unitary coherent’ (UC). ‘Unitary’ means we only perceive one interpretation at a time rather than a blur of multiple possible worlds. ‘Coherent’ means that we almost always perceive scenes that do not contain contradictory parts. While this form of first-person perceptual experience may seem obvious, it is in opposition to the requirements of optimal decision making, and to some forms of the ‘Bayesian brain’ hypothesis. We hypothesise that there are at least three types of ‘Bayesian’ action selection occurring in cognition, including a ‘maximum utility (MU) percept’ strategy that makes use of UC percepts. We give evidence from a video game experiment that is compatible with MU/UC perception and action selection, and is incompatible with optimal actions. Furthermore, it is compatible with the presence of utility bias in MU/UC perception: by changing the available actions we may be able to manipulate the subject’s percept of a fixed ambiguous stimulus.",>Charles Fox>Tom Stafford,>Sheffield University>Sheffield University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0070/index.html
2012,Measuring children's visual access to social information using face detection,"Other people are the most important source of information in a child’s life, and one important channel for social information is faces. Faces can convey affective, linguistic, and referential information through expressions, speech, and eye-gaze. But in order for children to apprehend this information, it must be accessible. How much of the time can children actually see the faces of the people around them? We use data from a head-mounted camera, in combination with face-detection methods from computer vision, to address this question in a scalable, automatic fashion. We develop a detection system using off-the-shelf methods and show that it produces robust results. Data from a single child’s visual experience suggest the possibility of systematic changes in the visibility of faces across the first year, possibly due to postural shifts.",>Michael Frank,>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0071/index.html
2012,The Effects of Feedback During Exploration Depend on Prior Knowledge,"Providing exploratory activities prior to instruction has been shown to facilitate learning. However, questions remain regarding the provision of guidance during the exploration phase. In this study, we replicated and extended a previous experiment by examining the effects of feedback during exploratory problem solving for children with varying levels of prior knowledge. Ninety-five children (M age ≅ 8 yrs) solved 12 novel math problems and then received brief conceptual instruction. After solving each problem, they received (a) no-feedback, (b) outcome-feedback, or (c) strategy-feedback. Consistent with the previous experiment, the results resembled an aptitude by treatment interaction. Feedback during exploration prior to instruction improved children’s procedural knowledge, but only for those with low prior knowledge. For children with higher prior knowledge, no feedback resulted in better procedural knowledge. Results suggest that providing feedback may not always be optimal.",>Emily Fyfe>Bethany Rittle-Johnson,">Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States of America>Vanderbilt University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0072/index.html

Here we test whether children can leverage this knowledge when inferring the meaning of a novel word. Through a novel word learning experiment we determine that children can use this information, drawing different conclusions for the most likely meanings of novel words in distinct grammatical categories. We use a Bayesian model to formalize the higher level knowledge that children might have about noun and adjective meanings.

2012,Verbal Satiation of Chinese Bisyllabic Words: A Semantic Locus and its Time Course,"Verbal satiation of Chinese bisyllabic words was studied in three experiments to ascertain the phenomenon, to track its time course, and to identify its locus. Experiment 1 asked the participants to judge if an exemplar matched a category in 22 blocks of 40 trials each. Within a block, one category appeared 20 times (repeated trials) while each of the remaining 10 categories appeared only twice (baseline trials). For the first 11 trials, response times (RTs) for the repeated ones were similar to RTs for the baseline ones. For the subsequent trials, repeated RTs were slower (by 9 ms) than baseline RTs, indicating a satiation effect. Its loci could be orthographic, semantic, or both, or on the associative links between form and meaning. In Experiment 2, category names were not shown. Participants judged if two exemplars belonged to the same category. Repeated RTs were faster (by 6 ms) than baseline RTs for the first 12 trials. Then, verbal satiation emerged but was short-lived (between the 13th and the 17th trial) and was of greater magnitude (20 ms) than that observed in Experiment 1. The satiation effect must be semantic, as only meanings were repeated. Experiment 3 asked participants to judge if two category names were identical, mostly an orthographic task. Repeated RTs were similar to baseline ones across all trials, suggesting no orthographic satiation. The results indicate that semantic satiation of Chinese words can be directly semantic (categorical). Its time course conforms to the habituation model described in Rankin, et al. (2009), i.e., sensitization (semantic priming) before habituation (semantic satiation) and habituation followed by dishabituation (recovery).",>Bruno Galmar>Jenn-Yeu Chen,">Institute of Education, National Cheng Kung University>Institute of Cognitive Science, National Cheng Kung University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0075/index.html

We report an experimental study that characterizes human learn- ing in a controlled dynamic game environment, and de- scribe a computational model that is capable of similar learning. The model learns by building up a represen- tation of the hypothesized causes and e ects, including estimates of the strength of each causal interaction. It is driven initially by simple guesses regarding such inter- actions, inspired by events occurring in close temporal succession. The model maintains its structure dynam- ically (including omitting or even reversing the current best-guess dependencies, if warranted by new evidence), and estimates the projected probability of possible out- comes by performing inference on the resulting Bayesian network.

2012,Noisy Newtons: Unifying process and dependency accounts of causal attribution,"There is a long tradition in both philosophy and psychology to separate process accounts from dependency accounts of causation. In this paper, we motivate a unifying account that explains people's causal attributions in terms of counterfactuals defined over probabilistic generative models. In our experiments, participants see two billiard balls colliding and indicate to what extent ball A caused/prevented ball B to go through a gate. Our model predicts that people arrive at their causal judgments by comparing what actually happened with what they think would have happened, had the collision between A and B not taken place. Participants' judgments about what would have happened are highly correlated with a noisy model of Newtonian physics. Using those counterfactual judgments, we can predict participants' cause and prevention judgments very accurately (r = .99). Our framework also allows us to capture intrinsically counterfactual judgments such as almost caused/prevented.",>Tobias Gerstenberg>Noah Goodman>David Lagnado>Joshua Tenenbaum,>University College London>Stanford University>University College London>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0077/index.html

Previous eye-tracking results have shown that children did not visually explore the A:B pair as much as adults in this task. We hypothesized that this lack of exploration could help account for the low scores of children in comparison to adults. The present study shows that children’ performance improves significantly if they are required to look at and process the A:B pair before they are shown the full A:B::C:? problem. This confirms our hypothesis that the A:B pair is insufficiently processed by children during the resolution of such problems.",>Yannick Glady>Jean-Pierre Thibaut>Bob French>Agnes Blaye,">LEAD-CNRS, U. of Burgundy>LEAD-CNRS, U. of Burgundy>LEAD-CNRS, U. of Burgundy>LPC, U. of Aix-Marseille",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0078/index.html
2012,Knowledge and implicature: Modeling language understanding as social cognition,"Is language understanding a special case of social cognition? To help evaluate this view, we can formalize it as the rational speech-act theory: listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to ""invert"" this model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar implicature (""some"" implies ""not all"", and ""N"" implies ""not more than N""). This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation.

2012,Analogical Problem Solving: Insights from Verbal Reports,"Problem solving is a complex cognitive activity that involves the construction of sequences of actions to reach a given goal. One powerful strategy is to identify analogies between the problem at hand and previously encountered ones. Relevant similarities between problems can be detected more easily if there is a high resemblance on the surface or with respect to structure. Earlier theoretical observations and performance data have pointed to two distinct kinds of analogical reasoning, direct solution transfer (transformational analogy) and the creation of a new solution based on adapted past reasoning processes (derivational analogy). In order to gain insights about the cognitive processes involved, we extend this work by an analysis of different kinds of verbal data. Planning protocols were collected prior to problem solving, and retrospective reports, evaluations, and instructions were elicited after the task was completed. Results show that the different kinds of analogical reasoning involved different degrees of analogy awareness, as reflected by the verbalizations. Derivational analogy involved problem solving on a more detailed and structured step-by-step basis than the more superficial transformational strategy, in which a simple matching procedure was employed.",>Linn Gralla>Thora Tenbrink>Michael Siebers>Ute Schmid,>University of Bremen>University of Bremen>University Bamberg>University Bamberg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0080/index.html

The relations between players are operationalized according to Fiske’s relational models theory (Fiske, 1991): communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching, and market pricing. This is achieved by using various ways of distributing the total payoff gained by a dyad of players in a series of Prisoner’s dilemma games: each player receives the total payoff (unity), one of the players receives more than the other (hierarchy), each player receives half of the total payoff (equality), each player receives a portion of the total payoff proportional to his/hers individual payoffs (proportionality). For these four conditions, the cooperation rates, the mutual cooperation, the mutual defection, and the payoffs gained are analyzed and compared for a series of forty games. The results show that in the proportionality condition there is less cooperation, less mutual cooperation, more mutual defection and less total payoff than in the other three conditions.",>Maurice Grinberg>Evgenia Hristova>Milena Borisova,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0082/index.html

In this paper, we examine a particular theory – the error likelihood model (Brown & Braver, 2005) – that attempts to account for the function of a particular brain area (the anterior cingulate cortex).

To address this question we tested participants’ performance in VCL tasks in which stimuli varied in three feature dimensions, one of which was relevant for the task and the other two were irrelevant. The relevant feature could be identified based on trial-by-trial feedback. In one condition the task relevant and irrelevant features were highly-salient. In the second condition all features had low-visual-saliency. Feedback information was also manipulated: In the high-information condition the task relevant feature could be identified by the information provided in each trial whereas in the mid-information condition the feedback was ambiguous and information from several learning trials was required in order to confidently identify the relevant feature. Surprisingly, our data shows that mid- and high-information feedback are similarly effective in high-saliency VCL tasks. In contrast, in low-saliency VCL tasks, mid-information feedback impairs learning. We suggest that VCL can be done effectively either when feedback is ambiguous or in low-saliency conditions, but not in scenarios when both challenges occur concurrently.",>Rubi Hammer>Vladimir Sloutsky>Kalanit Grill-Spector,>Northwestern University>Ohio State University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0084/index.html

Recently, several studies have examined retrieval in an open-interval design in which the participant, not the experimenter, determines when to terminate memory search. The present study performs the first direct comparison between participant-terminated and experimenter-terminated retrieval. No difference was found in the number of items retrieved from memory; however, inter-retrieval times (IRTs) did differ, such that the participant-terminated paradigm did not show the hyperbolic function typically found when using the experimenter-determined, closed-interval design. We were able to account for this result by equipping a simple relative sampling model with a memory search stopping rule that assumes that giving participants a pre-set retrieval interval causes them to search longer (and tolerate more search failures) than they would in the open-interval design.",>J.

Its purpose is to find out, through an experiment, how a whistle-blower (which we called ""Maverick"") affects the facilitation of a breakthrough in a rule-discovery task. In the experiment two hypotheses were tested: 1) Collaborative problem-solving task is facilitated by contribution of member with different perspective. 2) Problem-solving task is facilitated more as the number of participant with a different perspective increases. In the experiment, several sets of figures were presented in three different settings (without a different perspective, with Maverick, three members with a different perspective), where a group of six members (one human and five conversational agents) collaboratively engaged in a rule-discovery task via a text-based chat system.

It is known that people tend to interpret the quantifier ‘some’ as ‘not all’, though logically some means ‘some and possibly all’. However, we argue that this tendency to derive the scalar inference is variable and depends on the attitude of the reader or listener. When the ‘not all’ interpretation implies a confirmation of one’s attitude, we expect a higher endorsement rate of the inference. On the other hand when the ‘some and possibly all’ interpretation contains pro-attitudinal information, we expect a decrease in endorsement rate. These predictions are derived from Kunda’s theory of motivated reasoning (1990) and are supported by the data.

The present study investigates how different types of recipients process iconic gestures in a triadic communicative situation. Participants (N = 32) took on the role of one of two recipients in a triad and were presented with 160 video clips of an actor speaking, or speaking and gesturing. Crucially, the actor’s eye gaze was manipulated in that she alternated her gaze between the two recipients. Participants thus perceived some messages in the role of addressed recipient and some in the role of unaddressed recipient. In these roles, participants were asked to make judgements concerning the speaker’s messages. Their reaction times showed that unaddressed recipients did comprehend speaker’s gestures differently to addressees.

We discuss four experiments and a corpus analysis to investigate whether children and adults can infer information about a speaker’s knowledge based on the choice of an adjective. In Experiments 1 – 3, we found that adults are sensitive to adjective use as an indicator of intended con- trast dimension (e.g. that people say “red” if an object could have been blue, but “tall” if it could have been short). In Experiment 4, we found developmental differences between older and younger 4-year-olds: older children were above chance at selecting the referential dimension of interest, while younger children exhibited some contrast inference but a strong color bias. This suggests that by preschool, children are beginning to make inferences from a speaker’s word choices, but that there are differences between adjective types. We conducted an exploratory corpus analysis to investigate possible causes for this developmental difference.",>Alexandra Horowitz>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0093/index.html

In this paper we present an experiment which artificially truncates genuine contributions in ongoing text-based dialogues, to investigate the effects of lexical, syntactic and pragmatic predictability of the truncation point on the likelihood of one's interlocutor supplying a continuation.

2012,Social Networks are Encoded in Language,"Knowledge regarding social information is thought to be derived from many different sources, such as interviews and formal relationships. Social networks can likewise be generated from such external information. Recent work has demonstrated that statistical linguistic data can explain findings thought to be explained by external factors alone, such as perceptual relations. The current study explored whether language implicitly comprises information that allows for extracting social networks, by testing the hypothesis that individuals who are socially related together are linguistically talked about together, as well as the hypothesis that individuals who are socially related more are talked about more. In the first analysis using first-order co- occurrences of names of characters in the Harry Potter novels we found that an MDS solution correlated with the actual social network of characters as rated by humans. In a second study using higher-order co-occurrences, a latent semantic analysis (LSA) space was trained on all seven Harry Potter novels. LSA cosine values for all character pairs were obtained, marking their semantic similarity. Again, an MDS analysis comparing the LSA data with the actual social relationships yielded a significant bidimensional regression. These results demonstrate that linguistic information indeed encodes social relationship information and show that implicit information within language can generate social networks.",>Sterling Hutchinson>Vivek Datla>Max Louwerse,>University of Memphis>University of Memphis>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0096/index.html
2012,Memory Indexing of Sequential Symptom Processing in Diagnostic Reasoning,"Explaining symptoms by the most likely cause is a process during which hypotheses are activated and updated in memory. By letting participants learn about causes and symptoms in a spatial array, we could apply eye tracking during diagnostic reasoning to trace the activation level of hypotheses across a sequence of symptoms. Fixation proportions on former locations of possible causes reflected the causal strength of initial symptoms, a bias towards focal hypotheses, and the final diagnosis. Looking-at-nothing revealing memory activation consistent with process models of diagnostic reasoning was stable even after one week.",>Georg Jahn>Janina Braatz,>University of Greifswald>University of Greifswald,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0097/index.html
2012,Gestures Alter Thinking About Time,"Can gestures alter thought? Thinking about time is deeply interlinked with actions in space, and gestures are abstracted actions. Four experiments showed that gestures alter thinking about time. Participants heard the same speech accompanied by different gestures. The viewed gestures biased listeners toward circular or linear thinking, toward parallel or sequential thinking, toward moving-ego or moving-time perspectives. Gestures can abstract and show mental models more directly and succinctly than speech.",>Azadeh Jamalian>Barbara Tversky,">Teachers College, Columbia University>Teachers College, Columbia University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0098/index.html
2012,The Role of Task Characteristics in Children's Scalar Implicature Production,"In two experiments, we aimed to show the importance of task characteristics in scalar implicature production. In Experiment 1, we found that five-year-olds were significantly more pragmatic when given an Action-Based Task (ABT), in which they had to respond by performing an action than in a Truth-Value Judgement Task (TVJT), in which they had to evaluate the truth-value of statements. Experiment 2 showed that seven-year-olds were almost exclusively pragmatic on the same ABT and TVJT used in Experiment 1. However, we found a 22% drop in pragmatic responses when the TVJT contained world-knowledge statements (rather than statements about simple objects such as marbles). Together, these two experiments provide evidence that not only the nature of the task, but also its specific content is crucial in determining the extent to which young children produce scalar implicatures.",>Leen Janssens>Walter Schaeken,">KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium>KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0099/index.html
2012,Learning What is Where from Social Observations,"Observing the actions of others allows us to learn not only about their mental states, but also about hidden aspects of a shared environmental situation -- things we cannot see, but they can, and that influence their behavior in predictable ways. This paper presents a computational model of how people can learn about the world through social inferences, extending the Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) model of Baker et al. (2011), which treats agents' behavior as the output of a planning process and then reasons backwards to infer the most likely inputs to the agent's planner. We conducted a large-scale experiment comparing the world-state inferences of the model and those of human subjects, given observations of agents moving along paths in simple spatial environments. The model predicts subjects' graded beliefs about world states with high accuracy, showing the power of social learning for acquiring surprisingly fine-grained knowledge about the world.",>Julian Jara-Ettinger>Chris Baker>Joshua Tenenbaum,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0100/index.html
2012,Generalization of Learning in Games of Strategic Interaction,"We present a laboratory study investigating the generalization of learning across two games of strategic interaction. The participants’ performance was higher when a game was played after, as compared to before, a different game. We found that the generalization of learning from one game to another was driven by both surface and deep similarities between the two games. We developed a computational cognitive model to investigate mechanisms of generalization. Model development highlighted some of the challenges of cognitive modeling in general and modeling strategic interaction in particular. We found that development of reciprocal trust was a key factor that explained the observed generalization effect.",>Ion Juvina>Christian Lebiere>Cleotilde Gonzalez>Muniba Saleem,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0101/index.html
2012,Actively Learning Nouns Across Ambiguous Situations,"Previous research shows that people can use the co-occurrence of words and objects in ambiguous situations (i.e., containing multiple words and objects) to learn word meanings during a brief passive training period (Yu & Smith, 2007). However, learners in the world are not completely passive, but can affect how their environment is structured by moving their heads, eyes, and even objects. These actions can indicate attention to a language teacher, who may then be more likely to name the attended objects. Using a novel active learning paradigm in which learners choose which four objects they would like to see named on each successive trial, this study asks whether active learning is superior to passive learning in a cross-situational word learning context. Finding that learners perform better in active learning, we investigate the strategies that were most successful, discuss the implications, and model the results.",>George Kachergis>Chen Yu>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0102/index.html
2012,Learning Nouns with Domain-General Associative Learning Mechanisms,"Associative learning has been meticulously studied in many species, and diverse effects have been explained using a handful of basic assumptions and mechanisms. Human language acquisition proceeds remarkably quickly and is of great interest, but is arguably more difficult to capture under the microscope. Nonetheless, empirical investigations have led researchers to theorize a variety of language learning principles and constraints. While there may indeed be language-specific learning mechanisms that are distinct from more universal associative learning mechanisms, we seek to explain some basic principles of language acquisition using domain-general mechanisms. Using an experiment and a model, we show how the principles of mutual exclusivity—an assumption of 1-to-1 word-object mappings, contrast, and other constraints related to fast mapping may stem from attention mechanisms attributed to associative learning effects such as blocking and highlighting, but directed by competing biases for familiar and unfamiliar pairs instead of surprise.",>George Kachergis,>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0103/index.html
2012,Testing a Distinctiveness Explanation of the Primacy Effect in Free Recall Using Event-Related Potentials,"The primacy effect in free recall is commonly attributed to more frequent rehearsals for stimuli in the first few serial positions. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we investigated whether the first list position also provides a distinctive feature to the stimulus, which enhances its encoding and aids retrieval on a recall test. The amplitude of the P300 elicited by stimuli that deviate physically or semantically from their context has previously been shown to correlate with the probability of later recall when participants use rote rehearsal. We reasoned that if the temporal distinctiveness of the first item in a list contributes to its enhanced recall, such a P300 subsequent memory effect should be present for this item as well. Participants studied and immediately recalled lists of 15 words including one physically deviant “isolate” while their EEG was recorded. We quantified P300 amplitude by a principal component analysis, and applied a correction for inter-trial latency jitter. The first words in a list and isolates were better recalled than regular words in the middle list positions, and the P300 elicited by these words was correlated with subsequent recall. Regular words in the middle list positions, as well as words in the second list position, did not show such a P300 subsequent memory effect. These results support a distinctiveness-based explanation of the primacy effect in free recall.",>Siri-Maria Kamp>Glen R. Forester>Anthony R.

2012,Modeling Learning of Relational Abstractions via Structural Alignment,"Learning abstract relationships is an essential capability in human intelligence. Christie & Gentner (2010) argued that comparison plays a crucial role in such learning. Structural alignment highlights the shared relational structure between compared examples, thereby making it more salient and accessible for subsequent use. They showed that 3-4 year old children who compared examples in a word-extension task showed higher sensitivity to relational structure. This paper shows how a slight extension to an existing analogical model of word learning (Lockwood et al 2008) can be used to simulate their experiments. This provides another source of evidence for comparison as a mechanism for learning relational abstractions.",>Subu Kandaswamy>Kenneth Forbus,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0105/index.html

The present study showed that understanding dynamic concepts can be enhanced by gestures that convey action. Participants learned how an engine worked from one of two videos, with identical verbal scripts and identical diagrams. One video was accompanied by gestures showing the structure of the system; the other was accompanied by gestures showing the actions of the system. Both groups learned the basics of the system. Participants who saw the action gestures depicted more dynamic information in their visual explanations of the system and included more dynamic information in their verbal explanations of the system.

When explaining data with a graph, writers/researchers must generate graphs whose representation is consistent with the explanation contents. In the current study, we defined those who engage in academic activities using graphs on a daily basis as expert graph users and investigated whether they and undergraduates (non-experts) can adaptively generate a consistent graph with explanations from the viewpoint of the consistency of the contents and graph representation. Experiment 1 indicated that expert graph users adaptively generate a graph whose structure is consistent with the explanation contents. On the other hand, Experiment 2 suggests that undergraduates cannot do so. But in Experiment 3 undergraduates were supported by selecting graphs from provided candidates, but there was a limited concordance between the type of explanation and graph representation.",>Nana Kanzaki>Kazuhisa Miwa,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0107/index.html

We hypothesize that a minimal amount behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human-computer interaction. Further, we examine whether social facilitation effects occur depending on the gender of the participants and the interacting virtual agents. In a 2x2 between subjects design, participants interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm that gender plays a role when interacting with virtual agents that are capable of establishing rapport. Participants’ performance and effort were significantly enhanced when interacting with an agent of opposite gender that displayed rapport.

2012,"A tripartite trans-modal relationship among sounds, shapes and emotions: A case of abrupt modulation","The current project is a case study–and an extension–of the traditional investigation into sound symbolism (Hinton et al., 1994). Several studies have shown that certain sounds evoke images of particular shapes; for example, oral stop consonants are often associated with angular shapes, whereas sonorants (nasals, liquids, and glides) are associated with round shapes (Berlin, 2006; Köhler, 1947). Berlin (2006) attributes these associations to the similarities between abrupt acoustic amplitude modulation of stop consonants and abrupt change of the directions of lines, i.e., abrupt visual changes. In this study, we extend the stop-angular sound symbolic relation to the domain of emotions. Stops not only evoke the images of angular shapes, but are also associated with emotions that involve abrupt onsets. We further show that angular shapes themselves are associated with such emotions. Our three experiments thus establish a tripartite trans-modal symbolic relationship among three domains of cognition (sounds, shapes, and emotions). As an additional general implication, we argue that our experimental results support acoustic, rather than articulatory, bases of sound symbolism.",>Shigeto Kawahara>Kazuko Shinohara,>Rutgers University>Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0109/index.html
2012,Negating compound sentences,"How do reasoners negate compound sentences, such as conjunctions of the form A and B and disjunctions of the form A or B or both? A theory based on mental models posits that reasoners negate each clause independently, and enumerate the various possibilities consistent with the negation. It makes a novel prediction: negations of conjunctions should be more difficult to comprehend than negations of disjunctions. Two experiments corroborate the prediction. Experiment 1 tested participants’ ability to comprehend sentential negations by giving them assertions of the form: Bob denied that he wore a yellow shirt and he wore blue pants on Tuesday. Participants selected the clothing options that Bob possibly wore on Tuesday. Experiment 2 gave participants descriptions such as Bob loves Mary or Mary loves John or both, and they were required to formulate a denial by completing a sentence that started with “No, ...”. In both studies, participants’ responses were more accurate for denials of disjunctions than denials of conjunctions.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Isabel Orenes>Philip N.

2012,mReactr: A computational theory of deductive reasoning,"The mReactr system is a computational implementation of the mental model theory of reasoning (Johnson-Laird, 1983) that is embedded within the ACT-R cognitive architecture (Anderson, 1990). We show how the memory-handling mechanisms of the architecture can be leveraged to store and handle discrete representations of possibilities, i.e., mental models, efficiently. Namely, the iconic representation of a mental model can be distributed, in which each component of a model is represented by a “chunk” in ACT-R’s declarative memory. Those chunks can be merged to create minimal mental models, i.e., reduced representations that do not contain redundant information. Minimal models can then be modified and inspected rapidly. We describe three separate versions of the mReactr software that minimize models at different stages of the system’s inferential processes. Only one of the versions provides an acceptable model of data from an immediate inference task. The resulting system suggests that reasoners minimize mental models only when they initiate deliberative mental processes such as a search for alternative models.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Greg Trafton,>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0111/index.html
2012,The Specificity of Online Variation in Speech Production,"Phonetic variation is sensitive to lexical properties of words, such as frequency and neighborhood density, as well as contextual properties, such as predictability. Previous studies of lexically-induced variation have observed that both vowels and consonants are phonetically enhanced in words from dense neighborhoods, and have suggested that this effect is modulated only by the number and frequency of the neighbors. To determine whether contextual variation is driven by cognitive processes similar to those underlying lexical enhancement, three experiments examined the effect of contextually salient neighbors on the phonetic realization of vowels and initial consonant aspiration. Enhancement was found only for consonants, and only when the neighbor differed from the target word in a single feature. Unlike lexical effects, contextually-driven phonetic enhancement reflects a highly specific competition among words, a finding that can be rationalized in terms of the utility of speaker effort within a Bayesian model of word communication.",>Christo Kirov>Colin Wilson,>Johns Hopkins University>John Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0112/index.html

The idea that there might be no difference has been challenged by recent findings about the action observation network and tacitly challenged by certain tenets in enactive perception.

This model shows how subjects differentially depend on different cues to syntactic structure following changes in the reliability of those cues, as shown by Fine and Jaeger (2011).

This model predicts that these are not two distinct phenomena but rather two points on a continuum. We investigate that prediction here using adaptor stimuli intermediate between those which induce recalibration and selective adaptation, and find that the quantitative predictions of the model fit the data well.

A LAN-like component followed by a P600 was elicited for the anomaly of using a tense-bearing form with the negative ending, while only P600 was observed for the anomaly of using an infinitive form in the same environment. The non-application of morpho-phonological changes of verb roots (“onbin”) yielded an N400 component and a P600. The P600 components observed in all types of errors reflect the cost of processing morphological and/or syntactic anomalies, while the difference in the negativities suggest that two different mechanisms of rule-based computation and lexical memory are involved in the processing of Japanese verb conjugation.",>Yuki Kobayashi>Yoko Sugioka>Takane Ito,>The University of Tokyo>Keio University>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0116/index.html
2012,Event Segmentation of Agent Interactions: Comparing the Whole with Its Parts,"How do observers perceptually organize the events of individual agents when observing interactions among them? Do they readily perceive all events? Do they selectively perceive some events but not others? Do they see events overlooked by observers focusing on the individual agents? To explore these questions, participants viewed the Heider and Simmel (1944) animation, which shows three moving figures and elicits strong impressions of interacting agents. Participants in the default condition segmented the animation into meaningful events. Those in focus conditions did likewise, but focusing on one of the figures. Results indicate that participants in the default condition disregarded many events identified in the focus conditions, but identified only one event missed by focus-condition participants. These findings suggest that observers of interactions do not encode all events or gain additional insight by “seeing the big picture”; rather, they selectively perceive some events at the cost of overlooking others.",>Bryan Koenig>Bryan Koenig>David Pautler>Jonathan Herberg>Kum Seong Wan>Brian Monroe>Brian Monroe>Edwin Wirawan,>Institute of High Performance Computing>National University of Singapore>Institute of High Performance Computing>Institute of High Performance Computing>Institute of High Performance Computing>Institute of High Performance Computing>National University of Singapore>Institute of High Performance Computing,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0117/index.html
2012,Thinking in Patterns: using multi-voxel pattern analyses to find neural correlates of moral judgment in neurotypical and ASD populations,"Intentional harms are typically judged to be less forgivable than accidental harms. This difference depends on mental state reasoning (i.e., reasoning about beliefs and intentions), supported by a group of brain regions, the ‘theory of mind’ network. Prior research has found that (i) interfering with activity in this network can shift moral judgments away from reliance on mental state information, and (ii) high-functioning individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) rely significantly less on mental state information to make moral judgments than matched neurotypical (NT) participants. Across three experiments, we find using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) that, in NT adults, (i) one key region of the ToM network, the RTPJ, shows reliable and distinct spatial patterns of responses across voxels for intentional versus accidental harms, and (ii) individual differences in this neural pattern predict individual differences in moral judgment. By contrast, (iii) in ASD adults, the difference between intentional and accidental harms is not encoded in the voxel- wise pattern in the RTPJ or any other region, and (iv) higher symptom severity scores are predictive of diminished pattern discriminability. We conclude that MVPA can detect features of mental state representations and that these features are behaviorally and clinically relevant.",>Jorie Koster-Hale>James Dungan>Rebecca Saxe>Liane Young,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Boston College>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Boston College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0118/index.html

Simulations show that perception of vowels, fricatives, and stop consonants can all be captured under a single model in which listeners use their knowledge of phonetic categories to infer the sound that a speaker intended.

We find that exposure to examples increases conformity. Early exposure to examples improves creativity (measured by the number of common and novel features in drawings, and subjective ratings by independent raters). Repeated exposure to examples interspersed with prototyping leads to even better results.

While the phenomenon seems too obvious to demand further investigation, pathological conditions such as delusions of control suggest the requirement of further investigation into the phenomenon of sense of agency. The traditional view point regarding the role of intention in sense of agency is complemented by computational models of motor control. Accordingly, we hypothesized and tested the role of error monitoring mechanisms in the sense of agency by manipulating the feedback given independent of the responses of the participant while performing a Flanker task.

After establishing that different prosodic contours map onto these meanings (Experiment 1), we demonstrated that prosodic interpretation is shifted by inclusion of another alternative (Experiment 2); the reliability a speaker’s use of prosody to signal pragmatic alternatives (Experiment 3); and most importantly by the distribution of cue values along a continua (Experiment 4). We conclude that listeners derive linguistically meaningful categories from highly variable prosodic cues through rational inference about assumptions that are shared in the conversational context and adaptation to distributional characteristics of prosodic cues.",>Chigusa Kurumada>Meredith Brown>Michael Tanenhaus,>Stanford University>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0122/index.html

Participants (six experts and six intermediate students) recalled and explained the symptoms and laboratory data of a medical case description in the domain of cardiology.

2012,Concept learning as motor program induction: A large-scale empirical study,"Human concept learning is particularly impressive in two respects: the internal structure of concepts can be representationally rich, and yet the very same concepts can also be learned from just a few examples. Several decades of research have dramatically advanced our understanding of these two aspects of concepts. While the richness and speed of concept learning are most often studied in isolation, the power of human concepts may be best explained through their synthesis. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of one-shot concept learning, suggesting that rich generative knowledge in the form of a motor program can be induced from just a single example of a novel concept. Participants were asked to draw novel handwritten characters given a reference form, and we recorded the motor data used for production. Multiple drawers of the same character not only produced visually similar drawings, but they also showed a striking correspondence in their strokes, as measured by their number, shape, order, and direction. This suggests that participants can infer a rich motor-based concept from a single example. We also show that the motor programs induced by individual subjects provide a powerful basis for one-shot classification, yielding far higher accuracy than state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on just the visual form.",>Brenden Lake>Ruslan Salakhutdinov>Joshua Tenenbaum,>MIT>University of Toronto>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0124/index.html

We provide a probabilistic model that predicts the observed non-linearities and makes quantitative predictions about responses as a function of argument strength. Predictions were tested using a novel experimental paradigm that elicits the previously-reported response patterns with a minimal manipulation, changing only one word between conditions. We also found a good fit with quantitative model predictions, indicating that a probabilistic theory of reasoning can account in a clear and parsimonious way for qualitative and quantitative data previously argued to falsify them. We also relate our model to recent work in linguistics, arguing that careful attention to the semantics of language used to pose reasoning problems will sharpen the questions asked in the psychology of reasoning.",>Daniel Lassiter>Noah Goodman,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0125/index.html

Means of evaluating and comparing low-dimensional embeddings useful for visualization, however, are very limited. When proposing a new technique it is common to simply show rival embeddings side-by-side and let human judgment determine which embedding is superior. This study investigates whether such human embedding evaluations are reliable, i.e., whether humans tend to agree on the quality of an embedding. We also investigate what types of embedding structures humans appreciate a priori. Our results reveal that, although experts are reasonably consistent in their evaluation of embeddings, novices generally disagree on the quality of an embedding. We discuss the impact of this result on the way dimensionality reduction researchers should present their results, and on applicability of dimensionality reduction outside of machine learning.",>Joshua Lewis>Laurens van der Maaten>Virginia de Sa,">University of California, San Diego>Delft University of Technology>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0126/index.html
2012,Modeling Melodic Perception as Relational Learning Using a Symbolic-Connectionist Architecture (DORA),"Like many other cognitive processes, the perception of music involves processes and structural considerations that are highly relational in nature. To date, no physiologically plausible model has been used to simulate and explain how infants perceive melodic content. Here we used DORA (Discovery Of Relations by Analogy; Doumas et al., 2008), a domain-general symbolic-connectionist model of relational learning, to simulate melodic perception and categorization by infants (Chang & Trehub, 1977; Trehub et al, 1984), and to provide an account of the mechanism for melodic processing in infants. Given four input semantic features for each note in the melodic stimuli sequence (two of which could be internally obtained from the other two via a comparator), DORA’s performance matched the behavioral data from the infant studies. Furthermore, the ability of our model to simulate infants’ behavior is evidence that structured representations of relational musical properties can be bootstrapped from unstructured feature representations.",>Ahnate Lim>Leonidas Doumas>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0127/index.html
2012,The persisting benefits of using multiple-choice tests as learning events,"Taking a test tends to improve the retention of the tested information. Additionally, taking a test often influences the later retention of non-tested information, provided such information is related to the tested information in a specific manner. To illustrate, recent research has demonstrated that multiple-choice tests containing competitive alternatives can improve retention of both tested and non-tested information pertaining to such incorrect alternatives at least over a short delay. The present research investigated whether such improvements in retention would persist with a delay more likely to occur in educational contexts (i.e., 48 hr). Taking an initial multiple-choice test improved retention more than a comparable cued-recall test—for both previously tested and related information—and over both short and long delays. Moreover, misinformation effects seen for the multiple-choice test at the short delay were reduced. These results thus have important implications for the use of multiple-choice tests as learning opportunities.",>Jeri Little>Elizabeth Ligon Bjork,">Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, United States>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0128/index.html
2012,The perception of simplified and traditional Chinese characters in the eye of simplified and traditional Chinese readers,"Expertise in Chinese character recognition is marked by analytic/reduced holistic processing, which depends mainly on readers’ writing rather than reading experience (Tso, Au, & Hsiao, 2011). Here we examined whether simplified and traditional Chinese readers process characters differently in terms of holistic processing. When processing characters that are distinctive in the simplified and traditional scripts, we found that simplified Chinese readers were more analytic in perceiving simplified characters, which was dependent on their simplified Chinese writing performance. In contrast, the two groups did not differ in holistic processing of traditional characters, regardless of their performance difference in writing/reading traditional characters. When processing characters that are shared in the two scripts, simplified Chinese readers were also more analytic. These results suggest that simplified Chinese readers may have developed better analytic processing skills from experiences with simplified characters, and these skills are transferable to the processing of shared and even traditional characters.",>Tianyin Liu>Janet Hsiao,>University of Hong Kong>University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0129/index.html
2012,The Chinese Route Argument: Predicting the Longitude and Latitude of Cities in China and the Middle East Using Statistical Linguistic Frequencies,"The Chinese Room argument describes a thought experiment that suggests that for symbols to become meaningful, they must be grounded in perceptual experiences. Embodied cognition theorists frequently use this argument to claim that cognition requires perceptual simulation. We shed light on the symbol grounding problem by arguing that the structure of natural language provides language users with cues that allow them to bootstrap meaning from non-grounded symbolic co-occurrences, such that the statistical linguistic structure can bootstrap meaning with minimal grounding. Two studies show that co-occurrences of both Chinese and Arabic city names can reliably predict their longitude and latitude in China and in the Middle East. Using the statistical linguistic technique Latent Semantic Analysis, similarity ratings were obtained for Chinese city names (Study 1) and for Arabic city names (Study 2). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) coordinates of these similarity ratings correlated with the actual longitude and latitude of these cities, showing that cities that are located together share similar semantic contexts. These results suggest that the Chinese Room argument might be substituted with a Chinese Route argument: statistical linguistic frequencies of word co-occurrences provide language users with implicit cues about how to form perceptual representations.",>Max Louwerse>Sterling Hutchinson>Zhiqiang Cai,>University of Memphis>University of Memphis>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0130/index.html

2012,A unified theory of counterfactual reasoning,"A successful theory of causal reasoning should be able to account for inferences about counterfactual scenarios. Pearl (2000) has developed a formal account of causal reasoning that has been highly influential but that suffers from at least two limitations as an account of counterfactual reasoning: it does not distinguish between counterfactual observations and counterfactual interventions, and it does not accommodate back-tracking counterfactuals. We present an extension of Pearl’s account that overcomes both limitations. Our model provides a unified treatment of counterfactual interventions and back-tracking counterfactuals, and we show that it accounts for data collected by Sloman and Lagnado (2005) and Rips (2010).",>Christopher Lucas>Charles Kemp,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0132/index.html
2012,Superspace extrapolation reveals inductive biases in function learning,"We introduce a new approach for exploring how humans learn and represent functional relationships based on limited observations. We focus on a problem called superspace extrapolation, where learners observe training examples drawn from an n-dimensional space and must extrapolate to an n+1-dimensional superspace of the training examples. Many existing psychological models predict that superspace extrapolation should be fundamentally underdetermined, but we show that humans are able to extrapolate both linear and non-linear functions under these conditions. We also show that a Bayesian model can account for our results given a hypothesis space that includes families of simple functional relationships.",>Christopher Lucas>Douglas Sterling>Charles Kemp,">Carnegie Mellon University>Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, Berlin>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0133/index.html
2012,Does the utility of information influence sampling behavior?,"A critical aspect of human cognition is the ability to actively query the environment for information. One important (but often overlooked) factor in the decision to gather information is the cost associated with accessing different sources of information. Using a simple sequential information search task, we explore the degree to which human learners are sensitive to variations in the amount of utility related to different potential observations. Across two experiments we find greater support for the idea that people gather information to reduce their uncertainty about the current state of the environment (a ""disinterested"", or cost-insenstive, sampling strategy). Implications for theories of rational information collection are discussed.",>Doug Markant>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0134/index.html
2012,One piece at a time: Learning complex rules through self-directed sampling,"Self-directed information sampling--the ability to collect information that one expects to be useful--has been shown to improve the efficiency of concept acquisition for both human and machine learners. However, little is known about how people decide which information is worth learning about. In this study, we examine self-directed learning in a relatively complex rule learning task that gave participants the ability to ""design and test"" stimuli they wanted to learn about. On a subset of trials we recorded participants' uncertainty about how to classify the item they had just designed. Analyses of these uncertainty judgments show that people prefer gathering information about items that help refine one rule at a time (i.e., those that fall close to a pairwise category ""margin"") rather than items that have the highest overall uncertainty across all relevant hypotheses or rules. Our results give new insight into how people gather information to test currently entertained hypotheses in complex problem solving tasks.",>Doug Markant>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0135/index.html

Using SimStudent as a teachable agent in an interactive peer-learning environment, we have investigated how tutee (i.e., SimStudent) learning af- fected tutor (i.e., human student) learning. In this paper, we are particularly interested in how tutees’ shallow learning af- fects tutor learning. We are also interested in how the errors that the tutee makes affect tutor learning. The results show that teaching SimStudent on a fixed set of problems makes students easy to tutor SimStudent, which in turn helps stu- dents learn, but is likely to allow SimStudent to commit shal- low learning, which is harmful for tutor learning. It is thus crucial to let the student detect SimStudent’s shallow learning and extend teaching until SimStudent and the student achieve satisfactory competence.",>Noboru Matsuda>Evelyn Yarzebinski>Victoria Keiser>Rohan Raizada>William W.

2012,Causal Status meets Coherence: The Explanatory Role of Causal Models in Categorization,"Research on causal-based categorization has found two com-peting effects: According to the causal-status hypothesis, people consider causally central features more than less central ones. In contrast, people often focus upon feature patterns that are coherent with the category’s causal model (coherence hypothesis). Following up on the proposal that categorization can be seen as inference to the best explanation (e.g., Murphy & Medin, 1985), we propose that causal models might serve different explanatory roles. First, a causal model can serve as an explanation why the prototype of a category is as it is. Se-cond, a causal model can also serve as an explanation why an exemplar might deviate from the prototype. In an experiment, we manipulated whether typical or atypical features were linked by causal mechanism. We found a causal-status effect in the first case and a coherence effect in the latter one, suggesting both are faces of the same coin.",>Ralf Mayrhofer>Anselm Rothe,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0138/index.html
2012,Sparse category labels obstruct generalization of category membership,"Studies of human category learning typically focus on situations where explicit category labels accompany each example (supervised learning) or on situations were people must infer category structure entirely from the distribution of unlabeled examples (unsupervised learning). However, real-world category learning likely involves a mixture of both types of learning (semi-supervised learning). Surprisingly, a number of recent findings suggest that people have difficulty learning in semi-supervised tasks. To further explore this issue, we devised a category learning task in which the distribution of labeled and unlabeled items suggested alternative organizations of a category. This design allowed us to determine whether learners combined information from both types of episodes via their patterns of generalization at test. In contrast with the prediction of many models, we find little evidence that unlabeled items influenced categorization behavior when labeled items were also present.",>John V. McDonnell>Carol A.

2012,Automated and Partner-Specific Factors Influencing Lexical Entrainment,"Both automated priming (Pickering & Garrod, 2004) and partner-specific adaptation (Brennan & Hanna, 2009) have been proposed to underlie lexical entrainment (the repetition of words across interlocutors). Since activation levels of infrequently used words are relatively low, the effect of automated priming is predicted to be weaker in L2- than in L1-conversations, leaving more room for deliberate partner-specificity (Costa, Pickering, & Sorace, 2008). We tested this prediction by means of a production experiment, in which we varied whether participants interacted in their L1 or L2, and whether they addressed the confederate who had introduced a certain reference or another addressee. We found that in their L2, participants repeated references more frequently when addressing the person who had introduced the reference. Yet we did not find this effect of partner-specificity in the L1 conditions. Therefore, our results support the proposed combination of the two accounts.",>Lisette Mol>Rens Bogers>Tommy Bouwens,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0140/index.html
2012,Gesture structure affects syntactic structure in speech,"Different functions have been proposed for the hand gestures speakers spontaneously produce while speaking. The Information Packaging Hypothesis (Kita, 2000) states that gestures can structure rich spatio-motoric information into packages suitable for speaking. It therefore predicts that how information is divided over different gestures affects how it is divided over different processing units in speech: clauses. We indeed found that if participants were asked to express the manner and path of a motion in one gesture, they were also more likely to conflate this information into one clause in speech, whereas if they were asked to produce separate gestures, they were more likely to express manner and path in separate clauses too. These results support the view that there are speaker-internal motivations for gesture production. They confirm predictions made by the Information Packaging Hypothesis, which the Lexical Retrieval Hypothesis and the Image Activation Hypothesis do not make.",>Lisette Mol>Sotaro Kita,>Tilburg University>University of Birmingham,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0141/index.html
2012,Modeling Millisecond Time Interval Estimation in Space Fortress Game,"We investigated sources of the asymmetric bias found in estimation of a time interval (250-400 ms) embedded in the Space Fortress task (Donchin, 1989). Two hypotheses to explain this bias were tested in a behavioral experiment: 1) contamination from a different time interval representation, and 2) pressure to complete the task in time. Participants alternated between producing the target interval and producing either a shorter or a longer interval while the total time allowed for the task was manipulated. The results showed that the target interval estimate was significantly influenced by both manipulations. The effects were captured by incorporating the timing model of Taatgen and Van Rijn (2011) into the ACT-R model for Space Fortress (Bothell, 2010). Time estimation performed in a dynamic task requires understanding the influence of external temporal tasks as well as the procedural demands of performing multiple tasks under time pressure.",>Jungaa Moon>John Anderson,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0142/index.html

The current study investigates how L2 learners use gesture to communicate in conversational settings, and whether their gesturing in these settings facilitates L2 acquisition beyond the immediate context. The results reveal that L2 learners produce more iconic gestures when their interlocutor is visible, and that gesture production predicts their recall for novel words introduced in conversation. As such, they indicate that conversational gesturing enhances acquisition of the target language more broadly, facilitating L2 communication, acquisition, and retention.",>Laura Morett>Ray Gibbs>Brian MacWhinney,">University of Pittsburgh>University of California, Santa Cruz>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0143/index.html
2012,The Role of Imitation in Generating a Shared Communication System,"What types of learning or reasoning are involved in forming a new communication system? To answer this question, this paper presents a computational model for forming a new communication system. The model was developed with ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational). In the model, two agents autonomously assign their roles to themselves. Agents also posses general learning mechanisms implemented in ACT-R. By incorporating imitative learning into these general learning mechanisms, this paper studies the role of imitation in the process of forming a new communication system. Finally, we compared the proposed model against a human experiment. The results of the simulation indicate that through imitation, after a short period of interaction, an isomorphic system is created. The result of the simulation also suggests the existence of imitation in the process of forming a human communication system.",>Junya Morita>Takeshi Konno>Takashi Hashimoto,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0144/index.html

2012,Preservation of the Initial Analysis in Absence of Pragmatic Inference with Japanese Relative Clause Sentences,"Previous studies reported that language comprehenders tend to preserve the initial incorrect analysis with temporarily ambiguous sentences following structural reanalysis (Christianson et al., 2001; van Gompel et al., 2006). One possible criticism is that the sentences tested in previous studies allow comprehenders to pragmatically infer that the initial misanalysis may be true. It is thus unclear whether the tendency can still be observed where such inferences are not possible. The current study therefore tested the relative clause sentences in Japanese, which are temporarily ambiguous between the main clause and relative clause analysis. Crucially, our sentences differed from those in the past studies in that the correct interpretation following reanalysis makes an interpretation for the initial analysis pragmatically incompatible. The results demonstrated that an interpretation for the initial analysis persists even without pragmatic inference and that such incomplete syntactic representations are most likely due to excessive processing load.",>Chie Nakamura>Manabu Arai,">Keio University, Japan>The University of Tokyo, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0146/index.html

Do you know why? (3rd phase) It is because X (4th phase)."" To investigate how the brain responds when an individual finds the answer to the riddle (""It is because X"") humorous, this study used the fMRI method. We found that when a participant judged the answer to the riddle humorous, the bilateral amygdalae had been significantly activated at the 4th phase. When the participant judged the answer to the riddle banal (non-humorous), by contrast, the left amygdala was found to be significantly activated earlier at the 3rd phase. Therefore, we argue that in both cases, activation of the amygdala is related to the detection of optimal relevance.",>Tagiru Nakamura>Tomoko Matsui>Akira Utsumi>Mika Yamazaki>Kai Makita>Hiroki C.

2012,The Footbridge Dilemma Reflects More Utilitarian Thinking Than The Trolley Dilemma: Effect Of Number Of Victims In Moral Dilemmas,"Previous studies on moral judgment have assumed that the trolley and footbridge dilemmas (Thomson, 1985) reflect utilitarian and deontologist thinking, respectively. However, on the basis of the “intervention myopia” hypothesis (Waldmann & Dieterich, 2007) and recent findings in analyses of moral dilemmas (Nakamura, 2011), the current study led a somewhat paradoxical prediction: An effect of the manipulation of the number of victims, considered a utilitarian aspect of moral dilemmas, is larger in the footbridge dilemma than in the trolley dilemma. In order to test this prediction, two experimental studies were conducted in which the number of victims in the trolley and footbridge dilemmas were manipulated. Results of the two studies consistently showed an interaction between the dilemma type and the number of victims, thereby indicating that the manipulation of the utilitarian aspect of moral dilemmas has more effect on the footbridge dilemma, which is believed to reflect deontologist thinking.",>Kuninori Nakamura,>Seijo University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0148/index.html
2012,Anticipating changes: Adaptation and extrapolation in category learning,"Our world is a dynamic one: many kinds of objects and events change markedly over time. Despite this, most theories about concepts and categories are either insensitive to time-based variation, or treat people's sensitivity to change as a result of process-level characteristics (like memory limits, captured by weighting more recent items more highly) that produce irrational order effects during learning. In this paper we use two experiments and nine computational models to explore how people learn in a changing environment. We find, first, that people adapt to change during a category learning task; and, second, that this adaptation stems not only from weighting more recent items more highly, but also from forming sensible anticipations about the nature of the change.",>Daniel Navarro>Amy Perfors,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0149/index.html
2012,Language-induced Biases on Human Sequential Learning,"What are the effects of experience on subsequent learning? We explored the effects of language-specific word order knowledge on the acquisition of sequential conditional information. Korean and English adults were engaged in a sequence learning task involving three different sets of stimuli: auditory linguistic (nonsense syllables), visual non-linguistic (nonsense shapes), and auditory non-linguistic (pure tones). The forward and backward probabilities between adjacent elements generated two equally probable and orthogonal perceptual parses of the elements, such that any significant preference at test must be due to either general cognitive biases, or prior language-induced biases. We found that language modulated parsing preferences with the linguistic stimuli only. Intriguingly, these preferences are congruent with the dominant word order patterns of each language, as corroborated by corpus analyses. These findings suggest that mechanisms of statistical sequential learning are implicated in language, and experience with language may affect cognitive processes and later learning.",>Luca Onnis>EriK Thiessen,>University of Hawaii>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0150/index.html

The extent to which humans can do this distributional learning is an open question – artificial language learning experiments have yielded mixed results, prompting suggestions that distributional cues must be correlated with other cues, such as phonological regularities, for successful learning. We conducted a large-scale experiment comparing how distributional learning is afforded by two different types of cues – phonological regularities and semantic coherence.

It is often proposed that underlying this variation is a universal set of primitive spatial concepts that are combined differently in different languages. Despite the inherently cognitive assumptions of this proposal, such spatial primitives have generally been inferred in a top-down manner from linguistic data. Here we show that comparable spatial primitives can be inferred bottom-up from non-linguistic pile-sorting of spatial stimuli by speakers of English, Dutch, and Chichewa. We demonstrate that primitives obtained in this fashion explain meaningful cross-linguistic variation in spatial categories better than primitives designed by hand for that purpose, and reflect both universal and language-specific spatial semantics.",>Michael Pacer>Alexandra Carstensen>Terry Regier,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0152/index.html

Many explanations for this have been offered, usually relating to cognitive differences between children and adults. Here we explore an additional possibility: that differences in the social assumptions participants bring to the experiment can drive differences in over-regularization behavior. We explore this in the domain of language, where assumptions about error and communicative purpose might have a large effect. Indeed, we find that participants who experience less pressure to be ""correct"" and who have more reason to believe that any inconsistencies do not correspond to an underlying regularity do over-regularize more.

2012,"""Less is More"" in Bayesian Word Segmentation: When cognitively plausible learners outperform the ideal","Purely statistical models have accounted for infants’ early ability to segment words out of fluent speech, with Bayesian models doing the best (Goldwater et al. 2009). Yet these models often incorporate unlikely assumptions, such as children having unlimited processing and memory resources and knowing the phonemes in their native language. Following Pearl, et al. (2011), we explore the impact of the former two assumptions on Bayesian learners, and additionally investigate the impact of the first assumption. We find a significant “Less is More” effect (Pearl et al 2011; Newport 1990) where memory and processing constraints appear to help, rather than hinder, performance. Further this effect is more robust than earlier results and we suggest this is due a relaxing of the assumption of phonemic knowledge, demonstrating the importance of modeling assumptions.

2012,Categorial compositionality continued (further): A category theory explanation for the systematicity of recursive cognitive capacities,"Human cognitive capacity includes recursively definable concepts, which are prevalent in domains involving lists, numbers, and languages. Cognitive science currently lacks a satisfactory explanation for the systematic nature of recursive cognitive capacities. The category-theoretic constructs of initial F-algebra, catamorphism, and their duals, final coalgebra and anamorphism provide a formal, systematic treatment of recursion in computer science. Here, we use this formalism to explain the systematicity of recursive cognitive capacities without ad hoc assumptions (i.e., why the capacity for some recursive cognitive abilities implies the capacity for certain others, to the same explanatory standard used in our account of systematicity for non-recursive capacities). The presence/absence of an initial algebra/final coalgebra implies the presence/absence of all systematically related recursive capacities in that domain. This formulation also clarifies the theoretical relationship between recursive cognitive capacities. In particular, the link between number and language does not depend on recursion, as such, but on the underlying functor on which the group of recursive capacities is based. Thus, many species (and infants) can employ recursive processes without having a full-blown capacity for number and language.",>Steven Phillips>William Wilson,>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0159/index.html
2012,Modeling Concept Activation in Working Memory during Online Sentence Processing,"There have been several computational alternatives to the cloze task (Taylor, 1953) intended to approximate word predictability effects on eye movements during reading. In this study, we implement a computational model that instantiates each content word in a sentence as an input that activates semantic concepts in working memory. The predictability of a word is then determined by the extent to which its corresponding semantic representation is associated with the network of concepts already active in working memory from the preceding context. The computation of concept activation is based on a connectionist model (Landscape model, see van den Broek, 2010). Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is used to establish connections between words and simulate the long-term semantic associations among concepts (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). This model provides a means of investigating how language comprehension and eye movement behavior are affected by the activation of concepts in working memory.",>Patrick Plummer>Hsueh-Cheng Wang>Marc Pomplun>Yuhtsuen Tzeng>Keith Rayner,">University of California, San Diego>University of Massachusetts at Boston>University of Massachusetts at Boston>National Chung Cheng University>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0160/index.html

2012,Acoustic analysis supports the existence of a single distributional learning mechanism in structural rule learning from an artificial language,"Research on artificial language acquisition has shown that insertion of short subliminal gaps to a continuous stream of speech has a notable effect on how human listeners interpret speech tokens constructed from syllabic constituents of the language. It has been argued that the observed results cannot be explained by a single statistical learning mechanism. On the other hand, computational simulations have shown that as long as the gaps are treated as structurally significant units of the language, a single distributional learning model can explain the behavioral results. However, the reason why the subliminal gaps interfere with processing of language at a linguistic level is currently unknown. In the current work, we concentrate on analyzing distributional properties of purely acoustic representations of speech, showing that a system performing unsupervised learning of transition probabilities between short-term acoustic events can replicate the main behavioral findings without a priori linguistic knowledge.",>Okko Räsänen>Heikki Rasilo,">Aalto University, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics>Aalto University, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0162/index.html
2012,Optimally Designing Games for Cognitive Science Research,"Collecting cognitive science data using games has the potential to be a powerful tool for recruiting participants and increasing their motivation. However, designing games that provide useful data is a difficult task that often requires significant trial and error. In this work, we consider how to apply ideas from optimal experiment design to designing games for cognitive science experiments. We use Markov decision processes to model players' actions within a game, and then make inferences about the parameters of a cognitive model from these actions. We present a general framework for finding games with high expected information gain based on this approach. We apply this framework to Boolean concept learning, inferring the difficulty of Boolean concepts from participants' behavior. We show that using games with higher expected information gain allows us to make this inference more efficiently.",>Anna Rafferty>Matei Zaharia>Thomas Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0163/index.html
2012,Cognitive Workload and the Motor Component of Visual Attention,"Outside the laboratory, the ability to control visual input during multiple task performance by controlling where the eyes look and when is an obvious component of multiple task performance. However, inside the laboratory researchers either obviate the control of the eyes by presenting information from one task at a time or are oblivious to the need for just-in-time control of the motor component of visual attention. We investigate the effects of cognitive workload on eye movements in a paradigm that controls the demand on the eyes as an input channel while increasing workload by increasing the demand on working memory. Despite constant visual demands, we find that fixations become more scattered with increasing working memory load.",>Jason Ralph>Wayne Gray>Mike Schoelles,">Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, United States>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0164/index.html
2012,Order effects in diagnostic reasoning with four candidate hypotheses,"Sequentially observed symptoms in diagnostic reasoning have to be integrated to arrive at a final diagnosis. In our experiments employing quasi-medical problems, four sequentially presented symptoms were consistent with multiple diagnostic hypotheses. We tested whether symptom order creates biases in symptom evaluation. Early symptoms induced a bias towards the initial hypothesis even though an alternative hypothesis was equally supported. In two experiments, stepwise ratings were prompted to explicitly highlight alternative hypotheses. Explicit highlighting eliminated the bias towards the initial hypothesis if only two hypotheses competed, but the bias remained if more than two hypotheses were associated with symptoms in a sequence. Our results are consistent with process models of information integration that specify how early information can frame the processing of later information. Extending previous results obtained with fewer contending hypotheses, we show limits in impartially considering more than two hypotheses.",>Felix G.

2012,"Gaze cues in complex, real-world scenes direct the attention of high-functioning adults with autism","Autism is characterized by atypical use of social communicative cues, such as another person’s gaze or point. Despite these real-world difficulties, experimental manipulations often reveal minimal group differences. One factor that may contribute to this failure to find differences is the use of oversimplified and decontextualized social stimuli to examine these behaviors (e.g., a solo floating face). In the current study, we examined whether typical individuals and those with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder would use subtle gaze cues embedded in a natural, real-world scene to aid them in a change detection task using flicker presentation. Each scene contained three changes, and in some pictures, one of those changes was in the direction of gaze of the people in the scene. Even though neither group was aware that gaze cues aided in identification of the change, both groups showed a robust effect of gaze cues in change detection, such that changes in the line of gaze were detected first in a scene more often than those not in the line of gaze. These data illustrate typical use of gaze cues in high-functioning adults with ASD even in the context of a complex, naturalistic scene. Our findings suggest that attention to gaze cues may not be at the root of difficulties with joint attention in adults with autism",>Elizabeth Redcay>Daniel R O'Young>Lloyd R Slevc>Penelope L Mavros>John D Gabrieli>Pawan Sinha,">University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA>University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA>University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0166/index.html
2012,Examining the Representation and Understanding of Large Magnitudes Using the Hierarchical Alignment model of Analogical Reasoning,"Understanding scale is fundamental in science education, but scale comprehension is difficult. One reason difficulties may arise is a disconnect between the linear scale of magnitude and how scale information is cognitively represented. An intervention was designed to foster a linear representation of magnitude, based on the theory that people represent magnitude information in a hierarchically organized structure. The intervention extends principles from the progressive alignment model of analogical reasoning to include hierarchical alignment. Half the students in an undergraduate introductory-level geology class were given multiple opportunities to progressively align time to a constant spatial scale in a linear representation, and locate all previous scales relative to the current scale. The other half of the class received the same content and practice aligning time to space. The intervention group demonstrated a more accurate sense of the relative durations of geological events and a reduction in the magnitude of temporal location errors relative to the control group. These findings suggest that the hierarchical and progressive alignment of geologic time is an effective way to reduce magnitude-based errors in understanding geologic time. These findings are consistent with the category adjustment model, and suggest commonalities between number and time magnitude representation Educational implications are discussed.",>Ilyse Resnick>Thomas Shipley>Nora Newcombe>Christine Massey>Theodore Wills,>Temple University>Temple University>Temple University>University of Pennsylvania>Temple University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0167/index.html
2012,The Development of Joint Belief-Desire Inferences,"Human beings infer complex mental states given very little information—a facial expression, a sarcastic tone, or even a simple behavior. Previous work suggests that adults make joint belief and desire inferences based on an actor’s path, and that these inferences are well-explained by a Bayesian framework (Baker, Saxe, & Tenenbaum, 2011). We investigate the development of this ability by assessing mental state inferences made by children ages 3-6 after watching a short movie. Our results suggest that young children spontaneously make inductive inferences about desires or preferences, and that the ability to infer belief from behavior develops between ages 3-6, and possibly throughout later childhood. We formulate three computational models that capture the developmental shift between non-representational and representational theory of mind, and show that these models capture qualitative patterns in the children’s data.",>Hilary Richardson>Chris Baker>Joshua Tenenbaum>Rebecca Saxe,>MIT>MIT>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0168/index.html
2012,Expectations About the Temporal Structure of the World Result in the Attentional Blink and Repetition Blindness,"We consider how repetition blindness and the attentional blink might arise from prior assumptions about the occurrence of task-relevant states of the world. Repetition blindness and the attentional blink are behavioral deficits in the identification of items during rapid serial visual presentation at varying delays after identifying the first ""target."" Here we propose that both of these effects are explained by rational inference given prior expectations about the timing of task-relevant world transitions. While such expectations would be helpful in the natural world, they may result in unanticipated biases in laboratory settings. We show that a rational model using prior expectations of the timing of task-relevant information captures the basic repetition blindness and the attentional blink effects, and also the specific distributions of errors made during the attentional blink.",>Cory Rieth>Edward Vul,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0169/index.html
2012,Relating Activity Contexts to Early Word Learning in Dense Longitudinal Data,"Early word learning is contingent on linguistic input, but a child's linguistic experience is also embedded in the larger, natural structure of everyday life at home. We investigate the activity structure of life in the home of one young child, and link this structure to the child's early word learning. Our analysis is based on the dense, naturalistic, longitudinal corpus collected for the Human Speechome Project. To study activity structure, we apply probabilistic topic modeling techniques to the corpus. The emergent topics capture not only linguistic structure, but also spatial and temporal regularities indicative of coherent activity contexts. We consider the child's word learning with respect to caregiver word usage frequency and word distributions across activity contexts. We find that frequency and consistency of use across context are predictive of age of acquisition. Words that are used more frequently and in more contextually constrained settings are learned earlier, suggesting that activity contexts may be an important aspect of the child's natural learning environment and worthy of further study.",>Brandon Roy>Michael Frank>Deb Roy,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Stanford University>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0170/index.html

We designed an experiment to test the predictions of our complexity-based model when applied to moral dilemmas. It confirms that judgments about interest and morality may be explained in part by discrepancies in complexity.

We used concept map to evaluate how users' knowledge structure changed as a result of their learning by searching. The influence of different topics and different scenarios was also investigated. In the experiment, participants were divided into divergent and convergent scenario groups. They were asked to assume the role of a journal editor and search for information to be presented at an editorial meeting. They performed two tasks within the topics of environment and travel. We compared the two concept maps drawn by the participants before and after the search and analysed the web pages browsed by the participants during the tasks. The results showed that the participants' knowledge representation dynamically changed through learning as a result of searching, and the topics and scenarios influenced their processes and changed their conceptual structures before and after searching.",>Hitomi Saito>Yuka Egusa>Masao Takaku>Makiko Miwa>Noriko Kando,>Aichi University of Education>National Institute for Educational Policy Research>National Institute for Materials Science>The Open University of Japan>National Institute of Informatics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0173/index.html
2012,Towards a cognitive science of literary style: Perspective-taking in processing omniscient versus objective voice,"What are the consequences of narrative style for the cognitive operations that comprehenders perform? Third person narratives can adopt different voices. Omniscient voice has access to the mental states of characters, while objective voice only describes how characters would appear to an observer. It’s currently unknown what cognitive consequences different voices have for people processing third person language. We hypothesize that in building representations of described scenes, omniscient voice may make comprehenders more likely to adopt the internal perspectives of characters than objective voice. We tested this prediction in a narrative-image matching study. Participants read short passages describing a third person character in either omniscient or objective voice. They then saw an image that either depicted the described scene or not, and which depicted the event from the perspective of the character or not. Their task was to decide as quickly as possible whether the image matched the narrative. In cases where the narrative and image matched, participants were significantly faster to indicate the correct decision when the narrative voice and the image perspective matched—that is, an image from the character’s perspective after an omniscient narration or an image from a different perspective after an objective narration. This finding provides the first evidence that narrative voice affects the perspective from which comprehenders represent described scenes.",>Manami Sato>Hiromu Sakai>Jennifer Wu>Benjamin Bergen,">Hiroshima University>Hiroshima University>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0174/index.html

Moreover, it was assessed whether the impact of both information features is mediated by perceptions of topic complexity. Lay readers read medical text information varying in comprehensibility and controversiality and indicated their agreement strength and confidence with contained claims. Results revealed that participants’ reliance on their own agreement decision was stronger after reading comprehensible than incomprehensible texts, but this difference was larger in case of uncontroversial than controversial information.

Using subjective confidence reports, we present findings that support the use of both acoustic and phonemic cues during speech perception. Replicating earlier findings, we observed evidence for two well- defined phoneme categories along the voice-onset time continuum. Additionally, we also observed overconfidence in responses suggesting that the explicit representation of phonemes differs from the representations used to make identification and discrimination responses. Taken together with results from other studies, our findings support the claim that listeners can access both phonemic and acoustic representations, with explicit knowledge of the former but not the latter.",>Jordan Schoenherr>John Logan>Amy Winchester,>Carleton University>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0176/index.html

Research suggests that learners resist informants who provide incorrect information or insufficient information for accurate inference. Here we propose that learners’ choices of informants are rationally guided by the extent to which evidence supports accurate inference, rather than the sheer amount of evidence provided. Extending recent research formalizing pedagogical reasoning, we propose a computational model of efficient teaching. We present an experiment on adults testing three different hypotheses about learners’ preferred level of the amount of data. The results suggest that learners care about the inductive sufficiency of evidence, rather than the amount of evidence provided.

By applying the additive factors logic (Sternberg, 1969) to an auditory lexical decision task where both word frequency and stimulus quality were factorially manipulated, the reaction time data can be analyzed to study processing stages along the time course of spoken word recognition, and determine if frequency has an early or late locus. A significant underadditive interaction of frequency and stimulus quality was obtained. Surprisingly, the typically robust frequency effect was not reliable for words of low stimulus quality. This finding suggests that word frequency influences a relatively late stage in the spoken word recognition process. Implications for extant models of spoken word recognition are discussed.",>Cynthia Siew>Melvin Yap>Winston Goh,>NUS>NUS>NUS,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0178/index.html
2012,Zero anaphora and object reference in Japanese child-directed speech,"To learn the meanings of words, children must connect referents in the world around them with the sounds they hear. One proposed mechanism for this process is cross-situational word learning: tracking associations between words and objects across time. We consider the problem of anaphora for a crosssituational word learner: after an object has been introduced it is unlikely to be named in every succeeding reference to it. This problem is particularly pronounced in Japanese, which uses “zero anaphora,” where pronouns can be omitted from utterances. We analyze a corpus of Japanese mothers talking to children about sets of objects, originally recorded by Fernald and Morikawa (1993). Overall rates of anaphora were much higher for Japanese mothers compared with English mothers. Zero anaphora was primarily used when the discourse topic was already established, suggesting that a discourse-finding strategy may be important for word learning in Japanese. In addition, unexpectedly, due to the existence of zero anaphora as a common referential strategy, pronouns were more likely to be used when the topic was new than when it was given (reversing common results for English).

However, the sources of uncertainty have not been examined. Here we measure perceptual noise in initial conditions and stochasticity in the physical model used to make predictions. Participants predicted the trajectory of a moving object through occluded motion and bounces, and we compared their behavior to an ideal observer model. We found that human judgments cannot be captured by simple heuristics, and must incorporate noisy dynamics. Moreover, these judgments are biased in a way consistent with a prior expectation on object destinations, suggesting that people use simple expectations about outcomes to compensate for uncertainty about their physical models.",>Kevin Smith>Edward Vul,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0180/index.html
2012,Change detection under autocorrelation,"Judgmental detection of changes in time series is an ubiquitous task. Previous research has shown that human observers are often relatively poor at detecting change, especially when the series are serially dependent (autocorrelated). We present two experiments in which participants were asked to judge the occurrence of changes in time series with varying levels of autocorrelation. Results show that autocorrelation increases the difficulty of discriminating change from no change, and that observers respond to this increased difficulty by biasing their decisions towards change. This results in increased false alarm rates, while leaving hit rates relatively intact. We present a rational (Bayesian) model of change detection and compare it to two heuristic models that ignore autocorrelation in the series. Participants appeared to rely on a simple heuristic, where they first visually match a change function to a series, and then determine whether the putative change exceeds the variability in the data.",>Maarten Speekenbrink>Matthew Twyman>Nigel Harvey,>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0181/index.html

During familiarization, participants were exposed to pictures that appeared sequentially, in a seemingly random fashion. In fact, the pictures were grouped into triplets. In the surprise test phase, participants identified triplets they had seen during familiarization. There were three groups: a group that performed familiarization seated on an exercise bike (CON), a group that performed familiarization while engaged in resistance free cycling (RF), and a group that performed familiarization while cycling at 60% of maximum effort (EX). The CON group correctly identified 72% of triplets in the test phase. The RF and EX groups correctly identified 61% and 55%, respectively. Only the CON group demonstrated performance that was significantly greater than chance. The RF group only just failed to demonstrate significant SL. Thus, concurrent exercise can suppress SL.

We used a novel visual analogy paradigm with scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to explore several ways the brain uses inhibitory control to perform analogy. Previous studies have suggested that inhibitory control helps to manage working memory, so we used a separate task to measure individual differences in working-memory span to help us interpret differences in inhibitory control during reasoning. We found evidence that low working-memory span individuals likely lacked the necessary inhibitory control to keep unattended relations from entering visuospatial working memory early in processing. We also found that a late frontal event-related potential sensitive to relational distraction was differentially modulated in high and low working memory span individuals. These findings provide additional evidence for the importance of inhibitory control during analogical processing.",>Brian Sweis>Krishna Bharani>Robert Morrison,>Loyola University Chicago>Loyola University Chicago>Loyola University Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0186/index.html
2012,Effects of explicit knowledge on transfer of visuomotor sequence learning,"Skilled, sequential movements can be acquired explicitly or implicitly. In the present study, we examined the effects of explicit knowledge obtained through instruction or spontaneous detection on transfer of visuomotor sequence learning. In the first session, participants learned a visuomotor sequence by trial and error. In subsequent sessions, the sequence was changed according to specific rules. Some participants received explicit instruction about which specific rules changed, while the others did not. Knowledge of changes via explicit instruction led to slower performance with fewer errors; the sluggishness persisted even in the last phase of transfer learning. On the other hand, knowledge discovered independently by the participants produced slower performance in the initial phase of learning with fewer errors, but their performance speed eventually reached the same level as that of the unaware participants. These results suggest that explicit knowledge may help to reduce errors in the initial phase of visuomotor sequence learning but may interfere with increasing speed, particularly when the knowledge is given rather than found.",>Kanji Tanaka>Katsumi Watanabe,>The University of Tokyo / Japan Society for the Promotion of Science>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0187/index.html

We measured spontaneous movements during a perspective-taking task inspired by map reading. Analyzing the motion data to isolate its rotation and translation components in specific geometric relation to the task, we found out that most participants executed spontaneous miniature rotations of the head that were significantly related to the main task parameter. These head rotations were as if participants were trying to align themselves with the orientation on the map, but with tiny amplitudes, typically below 1% of the actual movements. Our results are consistent with a model of sensorimotor prediction driving spatial reasoning. The efference copy of planned movements triggers this prediction mechanism. The movements themselves may then be mostly inhibited; the spontaneous gestures that we measure are the visible traces of these planned but inhibited actions.",>Sergiu Tcaci Popescu>Mark Wexler,">CNRS (Laboratoire Psychologie de la Perception, UMR 8158) and Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France>CNRS (Laboratoire Psychologie de la Perception, UMR 8158) and Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0188/index.html

They were requested to solve 20 hypothetical purchase problems that had three alternatives described along two attribute dimensions. We measured their choices, confidence ratings, and response times. We found that adding the third alternative had significant effects for choice proportions and confidence ratings in all three conditions. The attraction effect was more prominent than the other two effects with regard to choice proportions. The compromise effect condition yielded low confidence ratings and long response times, although the choice proportion was high for the third alternative.

Efficiency was slightly better in the static condition for easy sums but declined substantially relative to the interactive condition for hard sums. Regression analyses revealed that in the static condition 22% of the variance in efficiency was explained by numeracy and working memory capacity, but 45% by numeracy, working memory capacity and attention switching skills in the interactive condition.

Here, we investigate to what extent it matters whether speakers interact with an artificial or a human dialogue partner (Study 1) and whether this adaptation indeed takes place at the conceptual level (Study 2). For Study 1 participants interacted either with a computer or with a human confederate and it was found that participants adapt in similar ways and just as much to a human dialogue partner as to a computer. Study 2 used a cross-language interaction paradigm, in which bilingual participants listened to English descriptions after which they had to refer in Dutch (thereby reducing the possibilities for lexical and syntactic alignment). The results showed that even with crosslinguistic prime-target pairings, participants aligned with the attributes used by their dialogue partner, providing further evidence for alignment at the conceptual level.",>Koen van Lierop>Martijn Goudbeek>Emiel Krahmer,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0192/index.html

Yet, artificial speech recognizers do not reach human level performance, nor do they typically even attempt to model human speech processing. In this paper, we introduce a biologically plausible neural model of real-time spoken phrase recognition which shows how the time-varying spiking activity of neurons can be integrated into word tokens. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of the model, which shows promise both in terms of recognition accuracy as well as recognition speed. The model is also pragmatically useful to cognitive modelers who require robust any-time speech recognition for their models such as real-time models of human-robot interaction.

The first simulation demonstrates performance advantages for the integrated model in an environment with a dynamic and complex reward structure. The second simulation contrasts the performances of the three models in a classic latent learning experiment (Blodgett, 1929), demonstrating advantages for the integrated model in predicting and explaining the behavioral data.",>Vladislav Veksler>Christopher Myers>Kevin Gluck,>Air Force Research Laboratory>Air Force Research Laboratory>Air Force Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0194/index.html
2012,The Impact of Colour Difference and Colour Codability on Reference Production,"It has often been observed that colour is a highly preferred at- tribute for use in distinguishing descriptions, that is, referring expressions with the purpose of identifying an object within a visual scene. However, most of these observations were based on visual displays containing only colours that were maximally different in hue and for which the language of experimentation possessed basic colour terms. The experiment described in this paper investigates the question whether people’s preference for colour is reduced if the colour of the target referent is similar to that of the distractors. Because colours that look similar are often also harder to distinguish linguistically, we also examine the impact of the codability of the used colour values. The results of our experiment show that, while people are indeed less likely to use colour when the colours in the display are similar, this effect is entirely due to the difficulty in naming similar colours. When the colours of target and distractors are similar but can be named using different basic colour terms, no reduction in colour use was observed.",>Jette Viethen>Martijn Goudbeek>Emiel Krahmer,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0195/index.html
2012,Bayesian Logic and Trial-by-Trial Learning,"Standard logic and probability theory are both beset with fundamental problems if used as adequacy criteria for relating logical propositions to learning data. We discuss the problems of exception, of sample size, and of inclusion. Bayesian pattern logic (‘Bayesian logic’ or BL for short) has been proposed as a possible rational resolution of these problems. BL can also be taken as psychological theory suggesting frequency-based conjunction fallacies (CFs) and a generalization of CFs to other logical inclusion fallacies. In this paper, this generalization is elaborated using trial-by-trial learning scenarios without memory load. In each trial participants have to provide a probability judgment. Apart from investigating logical probability judgments in this trial-by-trial context, it is explored whether under no memory load the propositional assessment of previous evidence has an influence on further probability judgments. The results generally support BL and cannot easily be explained by other theories of CFs.",>Momme von Sydow>Klaus Fiedler,">University of Heidelberg, Dept. of Psychology>University of Heidelberg, Dept. of Psychology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0196/index.html
2012,Color word learning is a gradual inductive process,"Most current accounts of color word acquisition propose that the delay between children’s first production of color words and adult-like understanding is due to problems abstracting color as a domain of meaning. Here we present evidence against this hypothesis, and show that, from the time children produce color words in a labeling task they use them to represent color. In Experiment 1, an analysis of early color word production errors finds that, before acquiring adult-like understanding, children make systematic hypotheses about color word meanings, which are best characterized as overextensions of adult meanings. Experiment 2 analyzes comprehension errors and finds that these overextensions result from overly broad categories, rather than a communicative strategy. These results indicate that the delay between production and adult-like understanding of color words is largely attributable to the problem of determining language-specific color boundaries.",>Katie Wagner>Karen Dobkins>David Barner,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0197/index.html
2012,The Role of the Primary Effect in the Assessment of Intentionality and Morality,"In moral dilemmas performing an action often leads to both a good primary and a bad secondary effect. In such cases, how do people judge whether the bad secondary effect was brought about intentionally, and how do they assess the moral value of the act leading to the secondary effect? Various theories have been proposed that either focus on the causal role or on the moral valence of the secondary effect as the primary determinants of intentionality and morality assessments. We present experiments which show that these theories have neglected a further important factor, the primary effect. A new theory is proposed that is based on the key assumption that people’s judgments of intentionality and morality depend on the strength of assumed reasons the agent has for the primary and secondary effects.",>Michael R.

2012,Children's Causal Learning from Fiction: Assessing the Proximity Between Real and Fictional Worlds,"Fictional information presents a unique challenge to the developing child. Children must learn when it is appropriate to transfer information from the fictional space to the real world and what contextual cues should be considered in this decision. The current research explores children’s causal inferences between fictional representations and reality by examining their developing sensitivity to the proximity of the fictional world to the real world, and the effect of this judgment on their subsequent generalization of novel causal properties. By 3-years of age, children are able to evaluate the data that they receive from fictional stories in order to inform their generalization of novel story content to the real world. Additionally, as children develop, they become better able to discriminate between close (realistic) and far (fantastical) fictional worlds when assessing which stories are likely to provide relevant causal knowledge.",>Caren M.

2012,Explaining Influences Children's Reliance on Evidence and Prior Knowledge in Causal Induction,"In two studies, we examine how prompting 5- and 6-year-olds to explain observed outcomes influences causal learning. In Study 1, children were presented with data consistent with two causal regularities. Explainers outperformed controls in generalizing the regularity that accounted for more observations. In Study 2, this regularity was pitted against an alternative that accounted for fewer observations but was consistent with prior knowledge. Explainers were less likely than controls to generalize the regularity that accounted for more observations. These findings suggest that explaining drives children to favor causal regularities that they expect to generalize, where current observations and prior knowledge both provide cues.",>Caren M.

Recognizing that completely covert interventions, while most effective, are difficult to implement, we focus on a more general mode of covertness. Based on insights from human abductive reasoning, we propose a delivery scheme that contains interventions that may be noticeable but whose true meanings are hidden or distorted (e.g., the human operators do not easily attribute the interventions to malicious attacks). We evaluate, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness and robustness of this scheme in escaping detection and disrupting performance.",>Hongbin Wang>Yanlong Sun,>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0201/index.html
2012,Choosing quantity over quality: syntax guides interpretive preferences for novel superlatives,"Acquiring the correct meanings of number words (e.g., seven, forty-two) is challenging, as such words fail to describe salient properties of individuals or objects in their environment, referring rather to properties of sets of such objects or individuals. Understanding how children succeed in this task requires a precise understanding not only of the kinds of data children have available to them, but also of the character of the biases and expectations that they bring to the learning task. Previous research has revealed a critical role for language itself in how children acquire number word meanings, however attempts to pinpoint precisely the strong linguistic cues has proved challenging. We propose a novel “syntactic bootstrapping” hypothesis in which categorizing a novel word as a determiner leads to quantity-based interpretations. The results of a word learning task with 4 year olds indicates that this hypothesis is on the right track.",>Alexis Wellwood>Darko Odic>Justin Halberda>Jeffrey Lidz,>University of Maryland>Johns Hopkins University>Johns Hopkins University>University of Maryland,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0202/index.html
2012,Expertise and the Wisdom of Crowds: Whose Judgments to Trust and When,"The Wisdom of Crowds describes the fact that aggregating a group’s estimate regarding unknown values is often a better strategy than selecting even an expert’s opinion. The efficacy of this strategy, however, depends on biases being non-systematic and everyone being able to make a meaningful assessment. In situations where these conditions do not hold, expertise seems more likely to produce the best outcome. Amateurs and professional judgments are examined in a subjective domain – reviews of shows from an Arts festival – asking which group provides better information to the potential theatre-goer. In conclusion, while following the crowd produces good results, where a smaller number of reviews are available, taking expertise into account improves their usefulness and discrimination between shows.",>Matthew Welsh,>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0203/index.html
2012,Complex First? On the Priority of Nouns in Language Acquisition and Evolution,"The paper points to an apparent paradox in the science of language. It regards the semantics of nouns and consists of a set of together incompatible, but individually well confirmed propositions about the evolution and development of language, the semantics of word classes and the cortical realization of word meaning. Theoretical and empirical considerations support the view that the concepts expressed by concrete nouns are more complex and their neural realizations more widely distributed in cortex than those expressed by other word classes. For a cortically implemented syntax-semantics interface, the more widely distributed a concept’s neural realization is, the more effort it takes to establish a link between the concept and its expression. If one assumes the principle that in ontogeny and phylogeny capabilities demanding more effort develop, respectively, evolve later than those demanding less effort, the empirical observation seems paradoxical that the meanings of concrete nouns, in ontogeny and phylogeny, are acquired earlier than those of other word classes.",>Markus Werning,">Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, NRW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0204/index.html
2012,Order Effects in Moral Judgment. Searching for an Explanation,"Research on moral judgment has shown that the order in which dilemmas are presented to subjects often has a strong influence on their judgment. However, the psychological mechanisms underlying order effects are still opaque. In this paper we aimed to isolate the features that a scenario must exhibit in order to influence judgment of subsequent scenarios. For this enterprise, we identified several features from a scenario known to cause order effects, and tested which of these features are necessary to influence subsequent scenarios. Although we still do not have a full understanding of what causes order effects, we made significant progress towards this aim. In five experiments we ruled out some promising explanations such as order effects being driven by an emotional activation linked to the first scenario. Instead, we found order effects to depend on whether the scenario being influenced and its preceding scenario share rather subtle structural similarities.",>Alex Wiegmann>Yasmina Okan,>University of Göttingen>University of Granada,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0205/index.html
2012,Explaining increases belief revision in the face of (many) anomalies,"How does explaining novel observations influence the extent to which learners revise beliefs in the face of anomalies – observations inconsistent with their beliefs? On one hand, explaining could recruit prior beliefs and reduce belief revision if learners “explain away” or discount anomalies. On the other hand, explaining could promote belief revision by encouraging learners to modify beliefs to better accommodate anomalies. We explore these possibilities in a statistical judgment task in which participants learned to rank students’ performance across courses by observing sample rankings. We manipulated whether participants were prompted to explain the rankings or to share their thoughts about them during study, and also the proportion of observations that were anomalous with respect to intuitive statistical misconceptions. Explaining promoted greater belief revision when anomalies were common, but had no effect when rare. In contrast, increasing the number of anomalies had no effect on belief revision without prompts to explain.",>Joseph Jay Williams>Caren Walker>Tania Lombrozo,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0206/index.html

This article presents evidence of the importance of olfaction in indigenous rituals and beliefs, as well as in the lexicon. The results demonstrate the richness and complexity of the domain of smell in Maniq society and thereby challenge the universal paucity of olfactory terms and insignificance of olfaction for humans.",>Ewelina Wnuk>Asifa Majid,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0207/index.html

We know that both social and non-social cues shift infants’ attention, but not how infants use these cues to learn basic events. With over 450 infants, four extensive eye-tracking studies in this thesis established a controlled paradigm for investigating how attention cues shape early learning. Our results showed that though social cues may temporarily detract attention away from certain learning events in the world, they appear to stimulate infants to display better learning about the cued event than when infants learn with other attention cues or on their own without attention cues.",>Rachel Wu>Natasha Kirkham,">Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0208/index.html

The inherent long-term nature of these models has been found to be at odds with preferences indicating short-term maximization in single play situations. With the present study we provide further evidence on the distinction between long-term and short-term oriented behavior. Evaluating experienced-based decisions over repeated and single play situations we demonstrate that both choice preferences and search behavior change in response to long and short-term framing. This suggests different cognitive approaches for single and repeated play situations, with single decisions often favoring risk-aversion and therefore the underweighting of rare events. These findings are in line with alternative models of risky choice as for example proposed by Lopes (1996) and also the literature on state-dependent foraging.",>Dirk U. Wulff>Thomas T.

The present study investigates whether people can acquire stable self-to-object spatial relations that are not disrupted by disorientation. Participants either simultaneously or sequentially viewed the object locations from a learning position amidst a geometrically irregular array. Next they were blindfolded and pointed to the objects under three conditions: before turning (baseline), after rotating 240° (updating), and after disorientation (disorientation). Finally, all participants were taken to another room to perform judgments of relative direction (JRDs) among remembered object locations. The internal consistency of pointing among objects was disrupted by disorientation following simultaneous viewing but not sequential viewing. However, participants’ memories of object-to-object relations were equivalent in the two viewing conditions. Together, these results suggest that people construct stable self-to-object spatial relations when they sequentially view each object of the irregular layout.",>Chengli Xiao>Fudan Chen,">Department of Psychology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China>Department of Psychology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0210/index.html

In a longitudinal experiment, participants were divided into four groups and solved two open-ended problems together using a video-conference system. Traditional metrics of usability and product acceptance were examined with respect to psychological variables such as personality, background knowledge, and feelings toward group members (mutual affect). The results show that group-level mutual affect is a strong predictor of system acceptability judgments, even after controlling for other pragmatic variables such as opinion convergence. It is proposed that evaluating one’s experience with a computer-mediated collaborative system is a sensemaking process and that the variables that modulate this process also influence subjective judgments of usability and acceptability of a system.",>Takashi Yamauchi>Takehiko Ohno>Momoko Nakatani>Yoichi Kato>Art Markman,>Texas A&M; University>NTT Cyber Solutions Laboratories>NTT Cyber Solutions Laboratories>NTT Cyber Solutions Laboratories>University of Texas,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0211/index.html

Here we provide a novel, two-choice SRT paradigm whereby the locations of response stimuli are sometimes predicted by a color-filled square that appears before each stimulus. Two out of eight colors are predictive on 80% of trials, and performance on these consistent trials was faster than on the other six colors that were equally likely to result in either of the two possible responses. A prediction task and interview followed the task, on which participants performed at near (slightly below) chance levels. We suggest that this task is a useful tool for studying associative learning in humans, as it provides reliable effects that appear to demonstrate implicit learning.",>Fayme Yeates>Fergal Jones>Andy Wills>Mike Aitken>Ian P.

2012,The Effect of Semantic Similarity is a Function of Contextual Constraint,"We investigate how the degree to which a context constrains the words that could occur in a sentence affects the processing of the word that does occur. Roland et al. (2012) found that processing was facilitated when target words were more semantically similar to word alternatives that could have appeared. Because this effect is independent of word predictability, it suggests that comprehenders may have separate expectations for words and more general semantic features. We show that the semantic similarity effect is modulated by the degree of contextual constraint. We found that facilitation due to semantic similarity was greater when contexts were less constraining, and lower when contexts were more constraining, independent of word predictability. We interpret these results as suggesting that in highly constraining contexts, comprehenders may expect specific words, and face difficulties when these expectations are violated, while in less constraining contexts, they may have more general expectations for semantic properties shared between the words that could occur.",>Hongoak Yun>Gail Mauner>Douglas Roland>Jean-Pierre Koenig,>University at Buffalo>University at Buffalo>University at Buffalo>University at Buffalo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0213/index.html
2012,Mutual Exclusivity and Vocabulary Development,"The words that children learn can be characterized as a semantic network, with links connecting related words. Recent analyses have shown these networks to have small-world structure, with a few highly-connected hub words facilitating short paths between otherwise distant words. This structure contributes to network robustness, and differences in structure can predict differences in language learning outcomes. While previous studies have shown that semantic network structure reflects linguistic input structure, we provide the first evidence that it is related also to children’s own language learning biases. Two-year old children who show a mutual-exclusivity bias have significantly more hub-like networks than children who do not, even when they know the same number of words. This finding contributes to our understanding of both semantic networks and the origins of mutual exclusivity.",>Daniel Yurovsky>Ricardo Bion>Linda Smith>Anne Fernald,>Indiana University>Stanford University>Indiana University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0214/index.html

This solution is supported by a wealth of empirical evidence from both adults and young children. However, these studies have recently been challenged by new data suggesting that human word learning mechanisms do not scale up to the ambiguity of real naming events. We replicate these experiments, collecting natural naming events both from a tripod-mounted camera and from a head-mounted camera that produced a “child’s-eye” view. Although individual naming events were equally ambiguous from both views, significant learning across events occurred only from the child’s own view. Thus, statistical word learning scales, but only from the right perspective.",>Daniel Yurovsky>Linda Smith>Chen Yu,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0216/index.html

Informed by findings in cognitive neuroscience, we hypothesize that a large ensemble of sparse codes flexibly represents and robustly traces drifting concepts. We experimentally test the population coding hypothesis on children’s cartoon videos. Our results show that learning the meanings of words over time is hard, especially when the concept evolves slowly, but the sparse population coding can handle the concept drift problem effectively while hypothesis elimination and simplistic parametric models have difficulty.",>Byoung-Tak Zhang>Jung-Woo Ha>Myunggu Kang,>Seoul National University>Seoul National University>Seoul National University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0218/index.html
2012,The role of recent versus future events in children’s comprehension of referentially ambiguous sentences: Evidence from eye tracking,"Findings from recent eye-tracking studies suggest that adults prefer to rely more on recently seen events than possible future events during sentence comprehension: When the verb in an NP1-VERB-ADV-NP2 sentence was referentially ambiguous between a recent action and an equally possible future action, adults fixated the target of the recent action more often than the not-yet-acted upon object (Knoeferle & Crocker, 2007; Knoeferle, Carminati, Abashidze, & Essig, 2011). We examined whether this preference for the recent event generalizes to five-year-old children. In an eye-tracking study, five-year-olds were presented a display with an animal and two other objects. On the next picture frame, the animal was depicted as performing an action (e.g., a horse galloped to a blue barn). Next, a spoken sentence referred either to an event involving the acted upon target object (the blue barn) or to an equally plausible future action event (e.g. galloping to the red barn). At the adverb in NP1-VERB-ADV-PP sentences, children fixated more often the recent (vs. future) event target. This result replicates the findings from the adult studies and suggests that, just like adults, children rely more on the recent event than expectations of an event that could happen next. At the same time, visual context effects of the recent events were subtly delayed for children (vs. adults). For adults, the recent-event preference emerged during the verb; for children, by contrast, it emerged post-verbally during the adverb. Thus, similar attentional mechanisms underlie visual context effects in both 5-year old children and adults but their time course differs.",>Lu Zhang>Lily Kornbluth>Pia Knoeferle,">CITEC, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany>CITEC, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany>CITEC, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0219/index.html

Namely, the probability of an event A after learning an event B should equal the conditional probability of A given B prior to learning B. We examine whether ordinary judgment conforms to the orthodox view. In three experiments we found substantial differences between the conditional probability of an event A supposing an event B compared to the probability of A after having learned B. Specifically, supposing B appears to have less impact on the credibility of A than learning that B is true. Thus, Bayesian updating seems not to describe the relation between the probability distribution that arises from learning an event B compared to merely supposing it.",>Jiaying Zhao>Vincenzo Crupi>Katya Tentori>Branden Fitelson>Daniel Osherson,>Princeton University>University of Turin>University of Trento>Rutgers University>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0220/index.html

We give arguments evincing that normative models of human- like rationality are vital in AGI systems, where the treatment of deviations from traditional rationality models is also necessary. After conceptually addressing our rationality-guided approach, two case-study systems, NARS and HDTP, are discussed, explaining how the allegedly “irrational” behaviors can be treated within the respective frameworks.",>Ahmed M.

Our claim is that the application of the concept of Cognitive Relevance to music would permit us to partially explain hearers' behavior and composers' choices. A computational model of Musical Relevance could also contribute to the formulation of a general computational theory of musical cognition. In turn, formulating an algorithm to compute Musical Relevance can shed light on the computational nature of the broader cognitive principle of relevance. We propose to unify Relevance Theory with the Generative Theory of Tonal Music, in order to compute Musical Relevance.

Results showed that although students did not differ between the two conditions on an immediate posttest, students in the erroneous examples group performed better on a delayed posttest.

2012,A Multi-Category Theory of Intention,"People excel at attributing intentionality to other agents, whether in simple scenarios such as shapes moving in two dimensions or complex scenarios such as people interacting. We note that intentionality attributions seem to fall into two categories: low-level intentionality in which an observer has a theory of mind about an agent, and high-level intentionality in which an observer believes the agent has a theory of mind about something else. We introduce the terms L-intentionality and H-intentionality to refer to these attributions, respectively, and describe this division by using examples from previous research. Social robots provide a particularly good platform for evaluating the presence of different types of intentionality, and we discuss how robots can help distinguish the relationship between H- and L-intentionality, based on a number of possible models that we enumerate. We conclude by highlighting some interesting questions about intentionality in general and the interplay between H- and L-intentionality in particular.",>Henny Admoni>Brian Scassellati,>Yale University>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0227/index.html
2012,A Narratological Approach for Narrative Discourse: Implementation and Evaluation of the System based on Genette and Jauss,"This paper proposes a computational system of narrative dis-course generation and its implementation. In the system, Ge-nette’s discourse theory is reconstructed as discourse techniques which transform the tree structure for a story into discourse structures. Also, we introduce Jauss’s reception theory to construct the control mechanism, which continues discourse generation through generation cycles based on the interaction between both narrator and narratee mechanisms. Moreover, we attempt two kinds of performance checks and two types of evaluation experiments and confirmed that the system generates diverse discourse structures on the rough correspondence with generative parameters. And furthermore, this study show that two different types of literary knowledge are organically integrated into a system’s framework.",>Taisuke Akimoto>Takashi Ogata,">Iwate Prefectural University, Takizawa, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Takizawa, Iwate, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0228/index.html
2012,A Bayesian Model of the Effect of Object Context on Visual Attention,"Research in visual cognition has demonstrated that scene understanding is influenced by the contextual properties of objects, and a number of computational models have been proposed that capture specific context effects. However, a general model that predicts the fit of an arbitrary object with the context established by the rest of the scene is until now lacking. In this paper, we explain the contextual fit of objects in visual scenes using Bayesian topic models, which we induce from a database of annotated images. We evaluate our models firstly on synthetic object intrusion data, and then on eye-tracking data from a spot-the-difference task and from an object naming experiment. For the synthetic data, we find that our models are able to detect object intrusions accurately. For the eye-tracking data, we show that context scores derived from our models are associated with fixation latencies on target objects.",>Ben Allison>Frank Keller>Moreno I.

2012,The Theory of Visual Attention without the race: a new model of visual selection,"The Theory of Visual Attention (TVA; Bundesen, 1990) is a comprehensive quantitative account of visual attention, which accounts for many empirical findings and has been extensively applied to clinical studies of attention. According to TVA, perceptual processing of objects occurs in parallel constrained by a limited processing capacity or rate, which is distributed among target and distractor objects with distractor objects receiving a smaller proportion of resources due to attentional filtering. Encoding into a limited visual short-term memory is implemented as a race model. Given its major influence it is surprising that few studies have compared TVA directly to alternative models. Here we insert an algebraically simpler model of encoding into TVA as an alternative to the race model and show that this provides a better fit to Shibuya and Bundesen’s (1988) whole and partial report data, which have been a keystone test bed for TVA.",>Tobias Andersen>Søren Kyllingsbæk,>Technical University of Denmark>University of Copenhagen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0230/index.html
2012,The Development of Second-order Social Cognition and its Relation with Complex Language Understanding and Memory,"In this study, the development of second-order social cognition and its possible relationship with language and memory were investigated. For this reason two second-order false belief tasks (FBT_2), a short term memory task (WST), a complex working memory task (LST), a linguistic perspective-taking test (PTT) and a double-embedded relative clause task (REL_2) were used with 21 Turkish kindergarten children (aged 4-5 years), 47 primary school children (aged 6-12 years) and 10 adults. A general developmental trend was found for all tasks. However, a multiple linear regression showed that once age was partialed out, none of the other tasks could predict FBT_2 scores. Our findings are consistent with the modularity view that Theory of Mind (ToM) is a faculty of the human mind that does not share intrinsic content with other faculties such as language and memory (Leslie et al., 2004) and also with Apperly's (2011) 'two-systems' account of Theory of Mind. However, it develops together with those other faculties which may constrain the expression of children’s false belief reasoning as a manifestation of their social cognitive abilities.",>Burcu Arslan>Annette Hohenberger>Rineke Verbrugge,>Middle East Technical University>Middle East Technical University>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0231/index.html
2012,Learning of motor maps from perception: a dimensionality reduction approach,"The role of perception in sighted infant motor development is well-established, but what are the processes by which an infant manages to handle the complex high-dimensional visual input? Clearly, the input has to be modeled in terms of lowdimensional codes so that plans may be made in a more abstract space. While a number of computational studies have investigated the question of motor control, the question of how the input dimensionality is reduced for motor control purposes remains unexplored. In this work we propose a mapping where starting from eye-centered input, we organize the perceptual images in a lower-dimensional space so that perceptually similar arm poses remain closer. In low-noise situations, we find that the dimensionality of this discovered lower-dimensional embedding matches the degrees-of-freedom of the motion. We further show how complex reaching and obstacle avoidance motions may be learned on this lower-dimensional motor space. The computational study suggests a possible mechanism for models in psychology that argue for high orders of dimensionality reduction in moving from task space to specific action",>Ankit Awasthi>Sadbodh Sharma>Amitabha Mukerjee,>IIT Kanpur>IIT Kanpur>IIT Kanpur,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0232/index.html
2012,Establishing a Database for Studying Human Face Photograph Memory,"Contemporary visual environments bombard us with hundreds of face images every day, and this places a non-trivial demand on long-term memory. However, little is known about what makes certain faces remain in our memories, while others are quickly forgotten. To establish a basis for face memorability exploration, we assembled a database of 8,690 face photographs from online sources, spanning diverse face and image characteristics. Workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk were asked to identify repetitions within a stream of these stimuli. Variations in image memorability (hit rates, false alarm rates, and their interactions) were reliable across participants, suggesting that face images may have different intrinsic levels of memorability. We discuss future directions in using this database to quantify face photograph memorability, as well as potential scientific and commercial applications.",>Wilma Bainbridge>Phillip Isola>Idan Blank>Aude Oliva,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0233/index.html

We assume that a collection of features is associated with each verbal element and that these features may project to the clauses in which they occur. When multiple verbal elements occur, it is possible for the features to conflict, necessitating mechanisms of feature blocking and overriding to determine feature projection. We consider the case of transitive and intransitive verbs in combination with the auxiliary verbs “be” and “have” in finite clauses. For intransitive verbs, we introduce an active/inactive voice feature distinction which aligns with the transitive distinction between active and passive voice.",>Jerry Ball>Christopher Myers,>Air Force Research Laboratory>Air Force Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0234/index.html
2012,Cognitive reserve and intelligence: Modulating the effects of damage in ageing dynamical systems,"The term cognitive reserve (CR) is used to describe the lack of direct relationship between the severity of brain damage, or pathology and subsequent levels of observed impairments. It has been suggested by Stern (2009), that CR may reflect differences in (a) pre-existing levels of some reserve capacity of the brain (the passive form); or, (b) differences in the underlying functional architectures supporting cognitive processes (the active form). In this paper, we explore two implementations of cognitive reserve that seek to target both these forms, extending recent work using dynamical systems framework (Baughman & Thomas, 2008; van der Maas et al., 2006). We examine how variability in cognitive reserve may modulate the effects of damage, at different levels of intelligence. The resulting simulations showed that level of intelligence does not differentially modulate the pattern of cognitive change following complete destruction of a single cognitive process, but that the effects of damage are proportionate across each level of intelligence. Following the two implementations of cognitive reserve that we tested, we found: (1) higher levels of connectivity within a given architecture resulted in greater spread of damage and lower endstate performance; and, (2) functional architectures that are characterized by greater specialization of function, rather than distributed function, differentially protected against the effects of damage, with these models also exhibiting better recovery.",>Frank Baughman>Natalie Baughman>Simon Mills,">Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia>University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia>Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0235/index.html

We address two parts of this question. First, what knowledge do people use to make sense of language inputs that may have been corrupted? Second, how much of this knowledge is used while people are processing sentences? We conduct a sentence production experiment and an on-line reading experiment in order to answer these questions. Both experiments provide evidence that syntactic knowledge can drive top-down reinterpretations of word identities, as well as syntactic reanalyses that are incompatible with people's language input. In addition, Experiment 2 provides evidence that this knowledge is deployed on-line, as people process sentences.",>Leon Bergen>Roger Levy>Edward Gibson,>MIT BCS>UCSD Linguistics>MIT BCS,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0236/index.html

Research on gestural alignment is, however, still in its early stages based on evidence from experimental settings. This paper provides a first systematic study of gesture form convergence based on a large sample of naturalistic dialogue data. We found evidence for gestural alignment, but not all form features of co-speech gestures are subject to this effect. In a detailed analysis of those sensitive features we further address questions of how gestural alignment depends on the temporal distance between gestures, and whether intra-speaker or inter-speaker influences on gesture form are stronger.",>Kirsten Bergmann>Stefan Kopp,>Bielefeld University>Bielefeld University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0237/index.html

2012,The Role of Semantic Transparency in the Processing of Verb-particle Constructions by French-English Bilinguals,"Verb-particle constructions (phrasal verbs) are a notoriously difficult aspect of English to acquire for second-language (L2) learners. This study was conducted to assess whether L2 English speakers would show sensitivity to the subtle semantic properties of these constructions, namely the gradations in semantic transparency of different verb-particle constructions (e.g., finish up vs. chew out). L1 French, L2 English bilingual participants completed an off-line (explicit) survey of similarity ratings, as well as an on-line (implicit) masked priming task. Bilinguals showed less agreement in their off-line ratings of semantic similarity, but their ratings were generally similar to those of monolinguals. On the masked priming task, the more proficient bilinguals showed a pattern of effects parallel to monolinguals, indicating similar sensitivity to semantic similarity at an implicit level. These findings suggest that the properties of verb-particle constructions can be both implicitly and explicitly grasped by L2 speakers whose L1 lacks phrasal verbs.",>Mary-Jane Blais>Laura Gonnerman,>McGIll University>McGill University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0239/index.html

To make progress we need to take advantage of the structure of object categories -- one compelling regularity is that object categories can be described by a small number of dimensions. We present Look-Ahead Monte Carlo with People, a method for exploring people's representations of a category where there are many irrelevant dimensions. This method combines ideas from Markov chain Monte Carlo with People, an experimental paradigm derived from an algorithm for sampling complicated distributions, with hybrid Monte Carlo, a technique that uses directional information to construct efficient statistical sampling algorithms.

2012,A Study of Loan Color Terms Collocation in Modern Japanese,"The Japanese lexicon consists of Japanese-origin words (WAGO), Chinese-origin words (KANGO) and words borrowed from English and other European languages (GAIRAIGO). The acquisition of words from three sources results in abundance of near synonyms without any clear rules when a particular synonym should be used. Loveday has hypothesized that WAGO/KANGO and GAIRAIGO concrete nouns are used to address similar phenomena of Japanese and Western origins, respectively. This is referred as Hypothesis of Foreign vs. Native Dichotomy (HFND). However, the matter of abstract nouns, adjectivals and their collocations remains unstudied. In contrast to the previous studies, based on questionnaires, our approach stems from statistical analysis of corpus data. Our results illuminate a distinguishable bias in the structure of collocations – nouns and adjectivals of the same origin tend to appear together more often than the ones of the different origins. Our finding implies extension of HFND to the level of collocations.",>Anna Bordilovskaya,">Graduate School of Humanities, Kobe University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0243/index.html

2012,Real-time expectations based on context speech rate can cause words to appear or disappear,"To test predictions of a forward modeling framework for spoken language processing, we characterized effects of context speech rate on the real-time interpretation of indefinite noun phrases using the visual world paradigm. The speech rate of sentence material distal to the onset of the noun phrase was manipulated such that the segments surrounding the determiner ""a"" in singular noun phrases had a faster speech rate than the surrounding context and the segments surrounding the onset of plural noun phrases had a relatively slow rate. These manipulations caused listeners to fail to perceive acoustically present determiners and to falsely perceive determiners not present in the signal. Crucially, fixations to singular and plural target pictures revealed effects of distal speech rate during the real-time processing of target expressions, strongly suggesting a locus in perceptual expectations. These results set the stage for quantitative tests of forward models of spoken language processing.",>Meredith Brown>Laura C. Dilley>Michael K.

2012,Metrical expectations from preceding prosody influence spoken word recognition,"Two visual world experiments tested the hypothesis that expectations based on preceding prosody influence the perception of suprasegmental cues to lexical stress. Experiment 1 showed that phonemically overlapping words with different initial stress patterns compete for recognition. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that fundamental frequency and syllable timing patterns across material preceding the target word can influence the relative activation of competing alternatives with different initial stress patterns. The activation of alternatives with initial stress was higher when preceding stressed syllables had suprasegmental acoustic characteristics similar to the initial syllable of the target word. These findings suggest that expectations about the acoustic realization of an utterance include information about metrical organization and lexical stress, and that these expectations constrain the initial interpretation of suprasegmental stress cues. These results are interpreted as support for expectation-based forward models in which acoustic information in the speech stream is interpreted based on expectations created by prosody.",>Meredith Brown>Anne Pier Salverda>Laura C.

In the following study, the authors show that people’s ability to perceive emotions in infants’ vocalizations (e.g., cooing and babbling) is linked to the ability to perceive timbres of musical instruments. In one experiment, 180 “synthetic baby sounds” were created by rearranging spectral frequencies of cooing, babbling, crying, and laughing made by 6 to 9-month-old infants. Undergraduate participants (N=145) listened to each sound one at a time and rated the emotional quality of the “synthetic baby sounds.” The results of the experiment showed that five acoustic components of musical timbre (e.g., roll off, mel-frequency cepstral coefficient, attack time and attack slope) could account for nearly 50% of the variation of the emotion ratings made by undergraduate students. The results suggest that the same mental processes are probably applied for the perception of musical timbres and that of infants’ prelinguistic vocalization.",>Michael Byrd>Casady Bowman>Takashi Yamauchi,>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0248/index.html
2012,Mothers Do Not Drive Structure in Adult Homesign Systems: Evidence from Comprehension,"Some profoundly deaf individuals without conventional linguistic input develop gestures, called “homesign,” to communicate. We examined homesign systems (HSs) used by four deaf Nicaraguan adults (ages 15-27), and evaluated whether homesigners’ mothers are potential sources for these systems. Study One measured mothers’ comprehension of descriptions of events (e.g., “A man taps a woman”) produced in homesign and spoken Spanish. Mothers comprehended spoken Spanish descriptions (produced by a hearing child) better than homesign descriptions, suggesting a greater degree of sharedness for spoken Spanish. Study Two compared the homesign comprehension of each homesigner’s mother to that of a native user of American Sign Language (ASL). ASL Signers performed better than mothers, confirming that homesign productions contain comprehensible information, to which mothers are not fully sensitive. Taken together, these results suggest that mothers are not the source of their deaf child’s HS, and add to evidence that HSs are more like language than like gesture.",>Emily Carrigan>Marie Coppola,">University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, United States>University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0249/index.html

Younger and older adults attempted to maximize the number of items found in a set of 4 puzzles in which they were at liberty to search within a puzzle or switch between them. Younger adults demonstrated faster uptake (i.e., number of words found as a function of time) from individual puzzles than older adults but experienced more deceleration of rates during the search. Additionally, older adults switched less often and their switching was less dependent on the uptake rate compared to younger adults. Both younger and older adults stayed longer than was optimal in a patch, older adults were especially likely to persevere suboptimally.

2012,"Connectivity Asymmetry Can Explain Visual Hemispheric Asymmetries in Local/Global, Face, and Spatial Frequency Processing","Left-right asymmetries have been noted in tasks requiring the classification of many visual stimuli, including Navon figures, spatial frequency gratings, and faces. The Double Filtering by Frequency (DFF) model (Ivry & Robertson, 1998), which postulates asymmetric frequency filtering on task-relevant frequency bands, has been implemented to account for asymmetric processing of each stimulus type above, but does not provide a fully mechanistic explanation, nor does it have direct neural correlates. The Differential Encoding (DE) model (Hsiao, Shahbazi, & Cottrell, 2008), which postulates that a known asymmetry in patch connectivity drives visual processing asymmetries, has previously been used to account for only one stimulus type. Here, we refine the DE model to match the published patch asymmetry more precisely and show that the DE model generalizes to three of the four datasets mentioned above.

2012,The face inversion effect and evoked brain potentials: Complete loss of configural information affects the N170,"The face inversion effect (FIE) is a reduction in recognition performance for inverted faces compared to upright faces that is greater than that typically observed with other stimulus types (e.g. houses; Yin, 1969). Nevertheless, the demonstration that the inversion effect in recognition memory can be as strong with images of dogs as with faces when the subjects are experts in specific dog breeds (Diamond & Carey, 1986), suggests that there may be other factors, such as expertise, which give rise to the FIE. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while subjects performed an Old/New recognition study on normal and scrambled faces presented in upright and inverted orientations. We obtained the standard result for normal faces: The electrophysiological activity corresponding to the N170 was larger and delayed for normal inverted faces as compared to normal upright ones. On the other hand, the ERPs for scrambled inverted faces were not significantly larger or delayed as compared to scrambled upright stimuli. These results, in combination, show how the effect of inversion on the N170 is reliably greater when the faces are normal compared to scrambled, which suggests the disruption of configural information affects the FIE.",>Ciro Civile>Heike Elchlepp>Rossy McLaren>Aureliu Lavric>Ian P.

2012,Face recognition and brain potentials: Disruption of configural information reduces the face inversion effect.,"The face inversion effect (FIE) refers to the decline in performance in recognizing faces that are inverted compared to the recognition of faces in their normal upright orientation (Yin, 1969). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while subjects performed an Old/New recognition study on normal and Thatcherised faces presented in upright and inverted orientation. A large difference in processing between normal upright faces and normal inverted faces was observed at occipital-temporal sites about 165 ms following stimulus onset, mainly in the right hemisphere. Thus electrophysiological activity, which corresponds to the previously described N170, had larger amplitude and was delayed for normal inverted faces as compared to normal upright ones. By contrast, the activity for Thatcherised inverted faces was not significantly changed or delayed as compared to Thatcherised upright stimuli. These results combine to show how the effect of face inversion on the N170 is reliably greater when the faces are normal rather than Thatcherised. Finally, these finding complement, at a neural level, our behavioral studies which suggest that the loss of some configural information affects the FIE.",>Ciro Civile>Heike Elchlepp>Rossy McLaren>Aureliu Lavric>Ian P.

2012,Strength of Perceptual Experience Predicts Word Processing Performance Better than Concreteness or Imageability,"Abstract concepts are traditionally thought to differ from concrete concepts by their lack of perceptual information, which causes them to be processed more slowly and inaccurately than perceptually-based concrete concepts. We examined this assumption by comparing concreteness and imageability norms to a set of perceptual strength norms in five separate modalities: sound, taste, touch, smell and vision. Results showed that that concreteness and imageability do not actually reflect the perceptual basis of concepts: concreteness ratings appear to be based on two different intersecting decision criteria, and imageability ratings are visually biased. Analysis of lexical decision and word naming performance showed that maximum perceptual strength (i.e., strength in the dominant perceptual modality) consistently outperformed both concreteness and imageability in accounting for variance in response latency and accuracy. We conclude that so-called concreteness effects in word processing emerge from the perceptual strength of a concept’s representation and discuss the implications for theories of conceptual representation.",>Louise Connell>Dermot Lynott,>University of Manchester>University of Manchester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0254/index.html

The current study tested people’s ability to learn new relational categories, using a learning test of pure higher-order relations. Each stimulus consisted of 4 objects varying on 3 dimensions. Each category was defined by three binary relations between pairs of objects, producing six logically different conditions. Every category was composed of the same number of relations, but differed in the manner that the relations were linked (i.e., by operating on shared objects). Various learning models were compared and the significance of their performance on the experimental task is discussed.

2012,Gaussian Process Regression for Trajectory Analysis,"Cognitive scientists have begun collecting the trajectories of hand movements as participants make decisions in experiments. These response trajectories offer a fine-grained glimpse into ongoing cognitive processes. For example, difficult decisions show more hesitation and deflection from the optimal path than easy decisions. However, many summary statistics used for trajectories throw away much information, or are correlated and thus partially redundant. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Gaussian process regression for the purpose of modeling trajectory data collected in psychology experiments. Gaussian processes are a well-developed statistical model that can find parametric differences in trajectories and their derivatives (e.g., velocity and acceleration) rather than a summary statistic. We show how Gaussian process regression can be implemented hierarchically across conditions and subjects, and used to model the actual shape and covariance of the trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct a generative hierarchical Bayesian model of trajectories using Gaussian processes.",>Gregory Cox>George Kachergis>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0256/index.html

We compare two methods for storing qualities (Q values) of state-action pairs, a lookup table and a connectionist function approximator. We find that RL solvers learn near-optimal solutions that also outperform a heuristic solver based on the explicit, general rules often given to nonogram players. Only RL solvers that use a connectionist function approximator generalize their knowledge to generate good solutions on about half of unseen problems; RL solvers based on lookup tables generalize to none of these untrained problems.",>Frederic Dandurand>Denis Cousineau>Thomas R.

2012,Rational Search of Associative Memory,"An important component of many, if not all, real-world retrieval tasks is the decision to terminate memory search. Despite its importance, systematic evaluations of the potential rules for terminating search are scarce. Recent work has focused on two variables: the total time spent in memory search before search is terminated and the exit latency (the time between the last retrieved item and the time of search termination). These variables have been shown to limit the number of plausible rules for terminating memory search. Here, we introduce an alternative stopping rule based on a rational moment-to-moment cost-benefit analysis. We show its ability to capture critical latency data and make testable predictions about the influence of changing the relative costs and benefits of memory search. Results from an experiment are presented that support the model’s predictions. We conclude that the decision to terminate memory search is based on moment-to-moment changes in subjective value.",>Eddy Davelaar>J.

2012,Strong structure in weak semantic similarity: A graph based account,"Research into word meaning and similarity structure typically focus on highly related entities like CATS and MICE. However,most items in the world are only weakly related. Does our representation of the world encode any information about these weak relationships? Using a three-alternative forced-choice similarity task, we investigate to what extent people agree on the relationships underlying words that are only weakly related. These experiments show systematic preferences about which items are perceived as most similar. A similarity measure based on semantic network graphs gives a good account for human ratings of weak similarity.",>Simon de Deyne>Daniel Navarro>Amy Perfors>Gert Storms,>University of Leuven>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0260/index.html
2012,Conceptual Event Units of Putting and Taking in Two Unrelated Languages,"People automatically chunk ongoing dynamic events into discrete units. This paper investigates whether linguistic structure is a factor in this process. We test the claim that describing an event with a serial verb construction will influence a speaker’s conceptual event structure. The grammar of Avatime (a Kwa language spoken in Ghana) requires its speakers to describe some, but not all, placement events using a serial verb construction which also encodes the preceding taking event. We tested Avatime and English speakers’ recognition memory for putting and taking events. Avatime speakers were more likely to falsely recognize putting and taking events from episodes associated with take-put serial verb constructions than from episodes associated with other constructions. English speakers showed no difference in false recognitions between episode types. This demonstrates that memory for episodes is related to the type of language used; and, moreover, across languages different conceptual representations are formed for the same physical episode, paralleling habitual linguistic practices.",>Rebecca Defina>Asifa Majid,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0261/index.html
2012,Interpersonal Effects of Emotions in Morally-charged Negotiations,"The majority of research on emotion and moral decisionmaking has focused on the intrapersonal effects of emotion. However, witnessing and displaying emotional expressions is also known to play a significant role in the facilitation and coordination of our social interactions. In this work, we hypothesize that interpersonal emotions effect moral appraisals by prioritizing different moral concerns. We investigate the impact of facial displays of discrete emotions, specifically anger and sadness, in a morally charged multiitem negotiation task. The results of our experiment support our hypothesis that moral appraisals can be strongly affected by interpersonal emotional expressions. We show that displays of anger may backfire if one of the parties associates moral significance to the objects of the negotiation, whereas displays of sadness promote higher concession-making. Overall, we argue that emotional expressions can shift moral concerns within a negotiation in ways that can promote cooperation.",>Morteza Dehghani>Jonathan Gratch>Peter Carnevale,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0262/index.html

Recent work on linguistic accent emphasizes the role of accent in person perception and social categorization, demonstrating that accent serves as a meaningful ethnic category indicator. In this paper, we examine whether accent can be used to implement socio-cultural markers. We investigate whether the accent of a virtual character, as a marker for culture, can cause cultural frame-shifts in individuals. We report an experiment, performed among bicultural and monocultural individuals, in which we test the above hypothesis. Our results show that accent can have a socio-cultural effect on people’s cognition.",>Morteza Dehghani>Peter Khooshabeh>Lixing Huang>Angela Nazarian>Jonathan Gratch,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0263/index.html
2012,How Function Assignment and Word Order are Determined: Evidence from Structural Priming Effects in Japanese Sentence Production,"Using a structural priming paradigm, the details of sentence production model have been investigated substantially, specifically the processes in grammatical encoding level. Many studies provide evidence that the function assignment stage and the constituent assembly stage are processed separately in grammatical encoding. However, it is less known whether these two stages interact with each other during the processes, and if so, how the processes are executed. In this study, we report three structural priming experiments in Japanese, in which function assignment and word order were manipulated independently and simultaneously in order to examine the processes at two stages directly. Our results revealed that priming effects patterns were different depending on whether the effects occur at function assignment stage or at constituent assembly stage. Based on the current findings, implications for the recent models of sentence production are discussed, from the perspective of the grammatical function assignment and word order determination.",>Ying Deng>Hajime Ono>Hiromu Sakai,>Elisabeth University of Music>Kinki University>Hiroshima University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0264/index.html
2012,"A Window of Perception When Diverting Attention? Enhancing Recognition For Explicitly Presented, Unattended, and Irrelevant Visual Stimuli by Target Alignment","Irrelevant, but overtly presented, stimuli that are temporally aligned with an attended target in a separate task are later inhibited in a recognition task (Dewald, Doumas, & Sinnett, 2011). This is contrary to findings in the perceptual learning literature where facilitation has been observed for later recognition of irrelevant motion stimuli, albeit after extensive exposure rates. Here, we adapted previous work to include higher exposure rates, and subsequently observed a reversal in inhibition in favor of enhanced recognition performance. Participants responded to immediate picture repetitions in a stream of line drawings while ignoring simultaneously presented superimposed words. A surprise test measured recognition for the unattended words. Words that had previously appeared simultaneously with a repeated picture were recognized significantly more often than words that had appeared with non-repeating pictures. The findings suggest that the exposure rate and the quantity of irrelevant stimuli can have a significant impact on whether perception is inhibited or facilitated.",>Andrew Dewald>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawai'i at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0265/index.html

This knowledge refers to two constituting aspects of causality: sufficiency and necessity. In standard theories both aspects are considered as being independent from each other. The present research tests this assumption. In an experiment we examined how peoples confidence in one of both aspects is affected, if they receive negative evidence for the complementary aspect. The presented data show that peoples confidence related to the aspect that has not been challenged by negative evidence decreases under such conditions.

2012,Spatial Co-ordination in Music Tuition,"Playing an instrument is a physical skill learned through observation, repetition and rehearsal. Students of orchestral instruments seek one-to-one tuition from expert musicians. However as they become more accomplished, the number of suitable tutors becomes more concentrated, especially for less common instruments. Often a tutor-student relationship develops over several years and temporary separation due to overseas performing, auditioning and teaching commitments is problematic. Some music education organisations use video conferencing as a solution to these problems, however it has long been recognised that interaction mediated by video conferencing is not analogous to a co-present experience. In this paper, ethnographic video analysis is used to study the interactions in co-present and separated instrumental music lessons. We find that the musical score represents more than a physical embodiment of the music - it plays an important role in coordinating activity and interaction. In video mediated lessons a single physical score can no longer be shared and interaction is changed as a result.",>Sam Duffy>Patrick G. T.

2012,Increased Vigilance in Monitoring Others’ Mental States During Deception,"Communicating false information during social interactions places unique cognitive demands on the speaker. One such demand is the increased need to track what another knows to avoid introducing contradictory information. The present study examines the minimal conditions required for vigilant mental state monitoring by using a game-like task that required participants to respond to virtual partners' questions with true or false information. In this task, there were no explicit demands to engage in mental state monitoring. We found increased response times when the answers potentially violated a partner's belief states - but only if participants believed their partner to be an actual cognitive agent. These effects were also shown to be additive to the simple demands in suppressing a truth bias while responding falsely. We argue that participants exert greater cognitive effort as an automatic response elicited by being situated in an interactive, deceptive context.",>Nicholas Duran>Rick Dale,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0269/index.html
2012,Mining Relatedness Graphs for Data Integration,"In this paper, we present the AbsMatcher system for schema matching which uses a graph based approach. The primary contribution of this paper is the development of new types of relationships for generating graph edges and the effectiveness of integrating schemas using those graphs. AbsMatcher creates a graph of related attributes within a schema, mines similarity between attributes in different schemas, and then combines all information using the ABSURDIST graph matching algorithm. The attribute-to-attribute relationships this paper focuses on are semantic in nature and have few requirements for format or structure. These relationships sources provide a baseline which can be improved upon with relationships specific to formats, such as XML or a relational database. Simulations demonstrate how the use of automatically mined graphs of within-schema relationships, when combined with cross-schema pair-wise similarity, can result in matching accuracy not attainable by either source of information on its own.",>Jeremy Engle>Ying Feng>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0270/index.html

It uses weighted lists as lexicons, probabilistic choice as a selection mechanism and lateral inhibition as the weight update scheme. The results demonstrate that the model is a generalization of the elementary naming game and provide a clearer picture of how big a lexicon agents use for the task, how this size can be controlled using the model parameters and a possible way of explaining how synonymy may be controlled.",>Kerem Eryılmaz>Cem Bozşahin,">Cognitive Science, Middle East Technical University>Cognitive Science, Middle East Technical University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0271/index.html

In an artificial grammar learning task, adult learners were exposed to a phonotactic pattern in which the first and last consonant agreed in voicing. Long-distance phonotactics encoded as strictly piecewise languages suggest that first-last phonotactic patterns should be unattested in natural language. However, recent theories of morphologically induced phonological patterns predict that long-distance agreement between the first and last consonant of a word can occur when the agreement is induced as a morphological alternation. The results of two experiments support the prediction that first-last harmony patterns are more easily learned when morphological cues to the pattern are present. Participants only learned the first-last pattern when presented as a morphological alternation.",>Sara Finley,>Elmhurst College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0272/index.html

The approach was not to train artists to be expert human figure modelers, but rather to derive a distribution of abilities across person and computer such that the system of person-in-interaction-with-technology exhibited expertise. These abilities were discovered though an analysis of two equivalent functional systems: figure modeling on a computer and figure drawing on paper. I report a test of the procedure on a group of non-artists, which yielded a high success rate.

However, they can be construed as requiring not selection of a task-set, just retrieval of a cue+stimulus-->response (CSR) mapping. In this paper we considered performance in a task-cuing paradigm in which participants saw a color cue that indicated whether they should classify a digit as odd/even or high/low using one of two responses. Half the participants were instructed in terms of tasks (Task group) whilst the others were required to learn the CSR mappings without mention of tasks (CSR group). Predicted performance under CSR conditions was modeled using an APECS connectionist network. Both the model and CSR group produced small switch costs, mostly due to incongruent stimuli, and large congruency effects that reduced with practice. In contrast, the Task group produced a larger switch-cost and a smaller, stable congruency effect.",>Charlotte Forrest>Heike Elchlepp>Stephen Monsell>Ian P. L.

Participants' eye movements and pupil size were recorded while they read single sentences. Surprisal values for each word in the sentence stimuli were estimated by both a recurrent neural network and a phrase-structure grammar. Higher surprisal corresponded to longer word-reading time, and this effect was stronger when surprisal values were estimated by the neural network. In addition, there was an early, positive effect of surprisal on pupil size, from about 250 ms before word fixation until 100 ms after fixation. This early effect, which was only significant for the network-based surprisal estimates, is suggestive of a preparation-based account of surprisal.",>Stefan Frank>Robin Thompson,>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0275/index.html

More recently,such models have also been used to generate properties associated with a concept; model-generated properties are typically compared against collections of semantic feature norms. In the present paper, we propose a novel way of testing the plausibility of the properties generated by a distributional model using data from a visual world experiment. We show that model-generated properties, when embedded in a sentential context, bias participants’ expectations towards a semantically associated target word in real time.

2012,Learning transfer in small group coordination,"This work tests the adaptation of groups from two generalizations of the stag hunt to a difficult third version, the notorious weakest-link game. The two training conditions either encouraged or discouraged the development of stable subgroups. Theories of modularization predict that stable subgroups will facilitate coordination in larger groups by helping them scale up. However, internal structure may also cause “overfitting,” or adaptation to only spurious features of training. In this experiment, experience with internal structure prevented coordination at larger scales, while experience in environments that discourage internal structure led to performance at least as high as in the control environments. I offer the analogy from individual learning transfer, that distracting details from superficially-similar domains may preclude transfer. This work has implications for the development and adaptability of coordinating groups. In particular, it demonstrates that coordination is not a monolith, and experience with one sense may impair performance under others.",>Seth Frey,>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0278/index.html

We performed a time series analysis of the mean fitness of ideas across the artificial society varying both the percentage of creators, C, and how creative they are, p using two discounting methods. Both analyses revealed a valley in the adaptive landscape, indicating a tradeoff between C and p. The results suggest that excess creativity at the individual level can be detrimental at the level of the society because creators invest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ideas.",>Liane Gabora>Hadi Firouzi,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0279/index.html
2012,Does domain size impact speech onset time during reference production?,"In referring to a target referent, speakers need to choose a set of properties that jointly distinguish it from its distractors. Current computational models view this as a search process in which the decision to include a property requires checking how many distractors it excludes. Thus, these models predict that identifying descriptions should take longer to produce the larger the distractor set is, independent of how many properties are required to identify a target. Since every property that is selected is checked, they also predict that distinguishing a target should take longer the more properties are required to distinguish it. This paper tests this prediction empirically, contrasting it with two alternative predictions based on models of visual search. Our results provide support for the predictions of computational models, suggesting a crucial difference between the mechanisms underlying reference production and object identification.",>Albert Gatt>Roger P.

What does a computational model need in order to capture the abstract knowledge people use for everyday reasoning? In this paper, we explore a novel modeling framework based on the probabilistic language of thought (PLoT) hypothesis, which conceptualizes thinking in terms of probabilistic inference over compositionally structured representations. The core assumptions of the PLoT hypothesis are realized in the probabilistic programming language Church (Goodman et al., 2008). Using ""ping pong tournaments"" as a case study, we show how a single Church program concisely represents the concepts required to specify inferences from diverse patterns of evidence. In two experiments, we demonstrate a very close fit between our model's predictions and participants' judgments.

However, it is not a trivial task given that the form and content of utterances is frequently underspecified for this level of meaning. In the present study we investigate participants’ competence in categorizing speech acts in such action-underspecific sentences and explore the time-course of speech act inferencing using a self-paced reading paradigm. The results demonstrate that participants are able to categorize the speech acts with very high accuracy, based on limited context and without any prosodic information. Furthermore, the results show that the exact same sentence is processed differently depending on the speech act it performs, with reading times starting to differ already at the first word. These results indicate that participants are very good at “getting” the speech acts, opening up a new arena for experimental research on action recognition in conversation.",>Rosa Gisladottir>Dorothee Chwilla>Herbert Schriefers>Stephen Levinson,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0282/index.html

2012,Is that your final answer? The effects of neutral queries on children’s choices,"Preschoolers often switch a response on repeated questioning, even though no new evidence has been provided (Krahenbuhl, Blades, & Eiser, 2009). Though apparently irrational, this behavior may be understood as children making an inductive inferrence based on their beliefs about whether intial responses were correct and the knowledgeability of the questioner. We present a probabilistic model of how the questioners' knowledge and biases to be positive should affect inferences. The model generates the qualitative prediction that an ideal learner should switch responses more often following a ""neutral query"" from a knowledgeable questioner than following queries from an ignorant questioner. We test predictions of the model in an experiment. The results show that four-year-old children are sensitive to questioners' knowledge when responding to a neutral query, demonstrating more switching behavior when the query is provided by a knowledgeable questioner.

2012,Abstract language comprehension is incrementally modulated by non-referential spatial information: evidence from eye-tracking,"Research on situated language processing has examined how visually depicted objects or concrete action events inform the comprehension of concrete sentences. By contrast, much less is known about how abstract sentence comprehension interacts with non-linguistic visual information. Moreover, while non-linguistic information can rapidly inform language comprehension when it is related to sentence content through reference or lexical-semantic associations, it is unclear to which extent this is the case when the visual context is ‘non-referential’ (i.e., not related to the sentence through reference or lexical semantic associations). We conducted two eye-tracking reading experiments to address these two open issues. In both experiments, reading times were shorter when sentences about conceptually similar abstract ideas were preceded by objects (words-on-cards in Experiment 1 and blank playing cards in Experiment 2) that were depicted close together (vs. far apart); and when sentences about conceptually dissimilar abstract ideas were preceded by objects that were depicted far apart (vs. close together). This happened rapidly (first-pass reading times) and incrementally (as the sentence unfolded). Thus, (a) comprehension of abstract language can be modulated by non-linguistic visual information (spatial distance between depicted objects) at the sentence level, and (b) online language comprehension can be informed by visual context even in the absence of an overt referential or lexical-semantic link.",>Ernesto Guerra>Pia Knoeferle,">Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster (CITEC), Bielefeld University.>Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster (CITEC), Bielefeld University.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0286/index.html
2012,Trading in a multiplayer board game: Towards an analysis of non-cooperative dialogue,"We collected and analysed a small dialogue corpus of people playing The Settlers of Catan. Dialogues are trading negotiations where Gricean maxims of cooperativity often break down as players adopt conflicting intentions in their attempt to win the game. This has consequences for what information players are sharing and for the sincerity of their contributions. In this paper, we motivate and describe a two-level scheme for analysing non-cooperative dialogues, where both levels are interdependent. Each dialogue move is a move in the game (e.g., an offer to trade), and a coherent contribution to the dialogue so far, connected to a prior segment with a coherence relation, such as indirect answerhood or rejection. Parsing and generating coherence relations is computationally feasible (e.g., Baldridge & Lascarides, 2005), and here we’ll argue that their semantics help to identify the game move, even when it is implicated rather than linguistically explicit.",>Markus Guhe>Alex Lascarides,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0287/index.html

A number of web users search for specific information and several studies have concluded that following the “information scent” is the fundamental process involved in the behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the strength of the “information scent” and user behavior by applying a usability inspection method developed for web usability studies. Three typical usability problems of navigation, (a) a page with a weak scent correct link problem, (b) a page with an unfamiliar correct link problem, and (c) a page with a competing links nested under competing headings problem, were compared with a problem-free page. In this study, we applied the Cognitive Walkthrough for the Web method to simulate a website, and analyze user behavior along with usability problems. Participants were asked to find an article on a simulated encyclopedia website. The success rate, total clicks, total time, fixation count and gaze time were analyzed. The results showed that the critical issues caused by usability problems appear on the target-link page.

2012,A time-invariant connectionist model of spoken word recognition,"One of the largest remaining unsolved mysteries in cognitive science is how the rapid input of spoken language is mapped onto phonological and lexical representations over time. Attempts at psychologically-tractable computational models of spoken word recognition tend either to ignore time or to transform the temporal input into a spatial representation. This is the approach taken in TRACE (McClelland & Elman, 1986), the model of spoken word recognition that has the broadest and deepest coverage of phenomena in speech perception, spoken word recognition, and lexical parsing of multi-word sequences. TRACE reduplicates featural, phonemic, and lexical inputs at every time step in a potentially very large memory trace, and has rich interconnections (excitatory forward and backward connections between levels and inhibitory links within levels). This leads to a rather extreme proliferation of units and connections that grows dramatically as the lexicon or the memory trace grows. Our starting point is the observation that models of visual object recognition – including visual word recognition – have long grappled with the fundamental problem of how to model spatial invariance in human object recognition. We introduce a model that combines one aspect of TRACE – time-specific phoneme representations – and higher-level representations that have been used in visual word recognition – spatially- (here, temporally-) independent diphone and lexical units. This reduces the number of units and connections required by several orders of magnitude relative to TRACE. In this first report, we demonstrate that the model (dubbed TISK, for Time-Invariant String Kernel) achieves reasonable accuracy for the basic TRACE lexicon and successfully models the time course of phonological activation and competition. We close with a discussion of phenomena that the model does not yet successfully simulate (and why), and with novel predictions that follow from this architecture.",>Thomas Hannagan>James Magnusson>Jonathan Grainger,>CNRS - Université de Provence>University of Connecticut - Haskins Laboratory>CNRS - Université de Provence,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0289/index.html

An experiment was conducted where pairs of participants, who were enrolled in a psychology course, engaged in a task of explaining to their partners the meanings of concepts of technical terms taught in the course. During the task, they interacted with a conversational agent, which was programmed to provide back-channel feedbacks and metacognitive suggestions to encourage and facilitate conversational interaction between the participants. Results of an experiment suggested that affective positive feedbacks from conversational agent facilitate explanation and learning performance. It is discussed that a conversational agent can play a role for pedagogical tutoring and triggers a deeper understanding of a concept during an explanation.",>Yugo Hayashi>Mariko Matsumoto>Hitoshi Ogawa,">Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan>Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan>Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0291/index.html
2012,Knowledge and Political Categorization,"A nationally representative sample of US adults completed two political categorization tasks. The first was to identify the political parties for hypothetical candidates with information given about demographics and stands on issues. The second task was to decide whether to vote for each candidate. On the identification task, judgments about whether a person is a Democrat were almost a perfect mirror image of judgments of whether a person is a Republican. In general, respondents were very successful in the identification task; there was a strong correlation with objective probabilities. Likewise, respondents were successful at the voting task, in terms of their own party interests. Success at these two tasks was positively correlated with a measure of political knowledge. The pattern of responses was also influenced by the political party of the respondent; suggesting that feature weights depended on party membership. Implications for models of categorization and reasoning are discussed.",>Evan Heit>Stephen Nicholson,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0292/index.html
2012,Going to Extremes: The influence of unsupervised categories on the mental caricaturization of faces and asymmetries in perceptual discrimination,"Recent re-analysis of traditional Categorical Perception (CP) effects show that the advantage for between category judgments may be due to asymmetries of within-category judgments (Hanley & Roberson, 2011). This has led to the hypothesis that labels cause CP effects via these asymmetries due to category label uncertainty near the category boundary. In Experiment 1 we demonstrate that these “within-category” asymmetries exist before category training begins. Category learning does increase the within-category asymmetry on a category relevant dimension but equally on an irrelevant dimension. Experiment 2 replicates the asymmetry found in Experiment 1 without training and shows that it does not increase with additional exposure in the absence of category training. We conclude that the within-category asymmetry may be a result of unsupervised learning of stimulus clusters that emphasize extreme instances and that category training increases this caricaturization of stimulus representations.",>Andrew Hendrickson>Paulo Carvalho>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0293/index.html
2012,Re-learning labeled categories reveals structured representations,"How do people learn to group and re-group objects into labeled categories? In this paper, we examine mechanisms that guide how people re-represent categories. In two experiments, we examine what is easy and what is hard to relearn as people update their knowledge about labeled groups of objects. In Study 1, we test how people learn and re-learn to group objects that share no perceptual features. Data suggest that people easily learn to re-label objects when the category structure remains the same. In Study 2, we test whether more general types of labeling conventions -- words that do or do not correspond with object similarities -- influence learning and re-learning. Data suggest that people are able to learn either kind of convention and may have trouble switching between them when re-structuring their knowledge. Implications for category learning, second language acquisition and updating representations are discussed.",>Andrew Hendrickson>George Kachergis>Caitlin Fausey>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0294/index.html
2012,A Matter of Process Accuracy: Observing or Inferring the Criterion of Few or Many Exemplars,"Can we tailor fit the training to enhance judgment accuracy by changing to the learning format that invites the most effective cognitive process for the task environment at hand? The results from a study on multiple-cue judgments revealed that observing the cues and the criterion of exemplars simultaneously with no feedback involved in the training, a learning format predicted to invite exemplar memory processes, was the better learning option when there were few unique exemplars in training. Inferring the criteria of different exemplars and receiving outcome feedback during training, a learning format predicted to invite cue-abstraction, was the better learning option when there were many unique exemplars in training.

2012,Identifying Kinematic Cues for Action Style Recognition,"Recognition of emotional states from other’s actions is one of key capability for smooth social interaction. The present study provides a computational-theory-level analysis on which feature may take a crucial role in recognition of emotional attributes in human actions represented as point-light display. Lead by the previous theoretical works and empirical findings, the velocity and acceleration profile was investigated as a major feature of emotional attributes classification. The results showed that emotional attributes in actions as well as action types could be identified by covariance of velocity profiles among multiple body parts. Since, despite different velocity profiles in different actions, these features for emotional attributes were found commonly in multiple different actions, it suggests that the action styles may be mediated by an information channel parallel to action types per se.",>Shohei Hidaka,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0296/index.html
2012,The Atoms of Cognition: A Theory of Ground Epistemics,"We propose a set of “atomic cognitive operational representations” on which higher level cognitive representations and processes can be built, thus providing fundamental building blocks for cognitive mechanisms necessary for intelligent actions. The fundamental concepts involved are elemental temporal changes of some quantities and in this representational scheme the temporal dimension is explicitly represented to fully characterize the meanings of the concepts involved at the epistemic ground level. This provides full grounding for all subsequent concepts that are built upon them, allowing cognitive systems embodying these concepts to have full and complete understanding and characterization of the concepts involved that it can use for various cognitive ends.

We proposed statistical models for two simple heuristics and two knowledge-based inferences, and com-pared how well these models could explain the observed pat-terns of inferences. It was found that the best model for explaining choice patterns varied depending on the inference problem. In particular, results suggested that participants used a simple heuristic when they had difficulty in retrieving clues pertaining to the inference problem. In contrast, when participants could retrieve enough clues pertaining to inference problems, they made inferences based on these clues.",>Hidehito Honda>Toshihiko Matsuka,">National Institute of Informatics

2012,Whose turn is it anyway? Same- and cross-person compound contributions in dialogue,"In natural conversation people sometimes build larger grammatical, semantic and pragmatic units out of multiple turns or installments. The incremental and collaborative character of these `compound contributions' presents challenges for theories of natural language processing. Compounds produced over successive turns by one person have often been analysed in essentially the same way as compounds produced by multiple people. In some recent accounts this putative equivalence has been taken as evidence for the claim that within- and cross-person language processing are fundamentally interchangeable. However, in this paper we present an analysis of compound contributions in a corpus of ordinary dialogues which shows that same- and cross-person compound contributions are constructed in different ways and have different semantic and pragmatic effects on the organisation of dialogue. In particular, we show that they differ in the pragmatic environments in which they occur and that they have different consequences for subsequent turn-taking and interpretation. This asymmetry highlights the need for models of dialogue that account for not just the inherent incrementality of dialogue, but the different status of each contributor towards a turn-in-progress.",>Christine Howes>Patrick G.

It was found that word acquisition is affected not only by word frequency, but also by whether a word is related to eventual misbalance of the body. The results are in favor of the hypothesis that the constraints of the human body may cause systematic variations of language acquisition as long as keeping the body balance is a typically difficult motor task for DS children. Additionally, we also found an asymmetry of the acquisition of the verbs and the nouns, depending on their frequency and relatedness to eventual misbalance of the body.",>Penka Hristova>Hristina Toushek>Georgi Petkov,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0300/index.html
2012,The Upbeat of Language: Linguistic Context and Embodiment Predict Processing Valence Words,"Previous studies have demonstrated that comprehension of conceptual metaphors elicits embodied representations. This finding is non-trivial, but begets the question whether alternative explanations are to be dismissed. The current paper shows how a statistical linguistic approach of word co-occurrences can also reliably predict metaphor comprehension. In two experiments participants saw word pairs with positive (e.g. happy) and negative (e.g. sad) connotations. The pairs were presented in either a vertical configuration (Experiment 1) or a horizontal configuration (Experiment 2). Results showed that response times could be explained by both the statistical linguistic approach and the embodied approach. However, embodied information was most salient in the vertical configuration and statistical linguistic information was most salient in the horizontal configuration. Individual differences modulated these findings, with female participants being most sensitive to the statistical linguistic approach, and male participants being most sensitive to the embodiment approach. These findings suggest that comprehension of conceptual metaphors can be explained by both linguistic and embodiment factors, but that their relative salience is modulated by cognitive task and individual differences.",>Sterling Hutchinson>Max Louwerse,>University of Memphis>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0301/index.html

In order to validate MAIDEN-DSF, two data sets have been used: a training set and a test set that contain the behavior of participants that performed the task with different conditions. The results suggest that MAIDEN-DSF is a considerable framework in order to model human behavior. The aim of this paper is to use MAIDEN-DSF to prove that participants do not perceive delay conditions when dealing with Dynamic Decision Making tasks.",>Angel Iglesias>M. Dolores del Castillo>J.

This technique was involved in four Infinite Landscape workshops conducted at Art Museums in Japan and Europe over the last five years.

This study examines how novices, who tend to express reproductively, acquire such expressive awareness over several weeks of practice of photography. We conducted case studies with two conditions: 1) one participant reflected only her own creative activities, and 2) one participant imitated eminent works of creative expression in the domain. As a result, the participants acquired expressive awareness in both conditions, though the contents of the expressive awareness were different. The imitation participant started to practice creative expressions and tried to control her creation consciously, while the reflection participant started to focus on precision of methods of expression.

Individuals in a city park played a simple lottery using a small set of marbles placed in an urn. Participants had the ability to actively improve their chances of winning but only by reducing the amount of money that they could possibly win. Hence, participants controlled the lottery’s intuitive trade-off between probability of success and potential payout. Across four different lottery structures, participants, on average, behaved systematically safer than the optimal strategy that maximizes expected gain.

2012,Children’s acquisition of fraction knowledge from concrete versus generic instantiations,"The goal of this experiment was to investigate elementary school children’s ability to acquire basic fraction knowledge. The degree of concreteness of instantiations of proportions was varied between subjects. First-grade children learned to label proportions of objects with fraction. Proportions were presented either as concrete, colorful flowers or as generic black and white circles. Following instruction, participants were given a test of learning and an immediate or delayed test of transfer involving proportions of novel objects. Those who learned with the generic materials scored higher on learning and transfer than those who learned with the concrete materials. Differences between learning conditions were attenuated for the delayed transfer test. These findings suggest that concrete, perceptually rich instantiations of fractions may hinder children’s acquisition of basic fraction knowledge in comparison to simple generic instantiations of fractions.",>Jennifer Kaminski>Vladimir Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0308/index.html
2012,The Role of Imagination in Augmenting Perceptual Representation,"Knowledge construction requires both perceptual information from external sources and our active interpretation of that information. Thirty one 5th grade elementary school students were asked to move plates in a Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task, which was displayed on a screen monitor. When the students were asked to respond to the weight of the plates, both imagination and non-imagination groups reported that they felt weight of the plates which actually had no weight. Also, students in imagination group reported that they felt the plates heavier than did those in non-imagination group. The result shows that haptic information can be created without providing any information through haptic channel. In addition, the result implies how knowledge is constructed based on previous knowledge and suggests that children create their own imaginary world even at a perceptual level. Also, it was discussed why imagination experience can maximize and help learning in embodiment activities.",>Seokmin Kang>Gregory Hallman Jr.>John Black,">Teachers College, Columbia University>Teachers College, Columbia University>Teachers College, Columbia University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0309/index.html
2012,The effects of amnesia on driving performance in elderly drivers.,"Cognitive dysfunction caused by some neurodegenerative diseases is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents. Previous studies have reported inconsistent results for prodromal and early stages of dementia. Few studies have directly compared the effects on driving performance of amnestic subtype of mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with those by normal aging in elderly drivers. The present study examines the association between cognitive decline and driving ability in elderly drivers with aMCI. The participants were 19 healthy young adults (HYA), 26 healthy elderly adults (HEA), and 12 elderly patients with aMCI. All performed a road-tracking, a car-following, and a harsh-braking task on a driving simulator (DS). Elderly participants also completed cognitive assessment tasks including measures of memory performance. All MCI participants showed a well-defined memory decline, and demonstrated significantly decreased performance on the car-following and road-tracking tasks as compared with the HYA group. However, the aMCI group also demonstrated significantly decreased performance on the car-following task as compared with HEA. In elderly participants, the car-following performance was positive correlated with the score on the Trail Making Test-B. This evidence indicates a difference for driving ability between individuals with symptomatic memory impairment and the aging-related memory of normal controls. This difference may be associated with flexibility of visual attention and executive function.",>Naoko Kawano>Kunihiro Iwamoto>Kazutoshi Ebe>Katsuyuki Ukai>Yusuke Suzuki>Hiroyuki Umegaki>Tetsuya Iidaka>Norio Ozaki,">Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University>Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University>Toyota Central R&D; Labs., Inc.>Kamiiida daiichi General hospital>Department of Geriatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University>Department of Geriatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University>Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University>Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0310/index.html

We argue that cognitive models implemented in vector-symbolic architectures (VSAs) intrinsically operate at both of levels and thus provide a needed bridge. We characterize the sub-symbolic level of VSAs in terms of a small set of linear algebra operations. We characterize the symbolic level of VSAs in terms of cognitive processes, in particular how information is represented, stored, and retrieved, and classify vector-symbolic cognitive models in the literature according to their implementation of these processes. On the basis of our analysis, we speculate on avenues for future research, and suggest means for theoretical unification of existent models.",>Matthew Kelly>Robert West,>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0311/index.html
2012,Sex Differences in the Discrimination of Non-Native Speech Sounds,"This study examined sex differences in the discrimination of minimal pairs of foreign language (non-native) tonemes. Adult native speakers of English (237 women and 177 men), with no prior exposure to a tonal language, performed an AX-task, which required them to discriminate between rising and falling-rising Norwegian tonemes. When controlling for nonverbal intelligence, prior exposure to foreign languages, and age, sensitivity measures (A’) showed a clear male advantage. Thus, the sex differences previously observed in non-linguistic temporal processing tasks appear to extend to the discrimination of unfamiliar non-native speech sounds. These sex differences in auditory processing may be due to anatomical differences between men and women in the ratio of white to grey matter in the left hemisphere, which, in turn, might affect speed of neural transmission. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate on cognitive effects of putative sex differences in intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity.",>Vera Kempe>John C. Thoresen>Patricia J.

In Experiment 1, participants who were given feedback about their performance did better on problems based on disjunctions that were designed to elicit illusory inferences.

In these studies, the goal states were given by the experimenters and the participants were instructed to reach them. In the present study, we investigated whether the same facilitative effect could be obtained when the participants were forced to find the goal state by themselves. We used the 6-coin problem and compared the performance between the self goal setting condition and the control condition. The results showed that the participants in the self goal setting condition could solve the problem less often than those in the control condition when they were not allowed to reach the other goal state. It, however, slightly facilitated the insight problem solving if the participants were allowed to change the goal. The results indicated that self goal setting is effective in finding emergent goals.",>Sachiko Kiyokawa>Katsuyuki Hayashi>Toshihiko Matsuka,>Chubu University>Chubu University>Chiba University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0316/index.html
2012,Differences in eye movements between same and other race face recognition.,"Eye movements of twelve Caucasian participants were measured whilst they performed a recognition test of same (Caucasian) and other race (Indian) faces. We observed a standard other-race effect, with more items recognised correctly, fewer false alarms, and reduced reaction time to same-race than other-race faces. Additionally, a differential pattern of eye movements between races emerged. During the study phase, samerace faces were fixated more than other-race faces, whilst other-race faces resulted in a greater proportion of fixations to internal face features than same-race faces. At test, whilst no differences between races emerged in the number of fixations or in the proportion of fixations made to internal features, a significantly greater level of fixations were made to the left hemispace for other-race faces for both previously studied and lure faces. These differences in the pattern of fixation plausibly reflect the greater effort in the processing of other-race than same-race faces.",>Eve Klama>Fraser Milton,>University of Exeter>University of Exeter,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0317/index.html

We investigated a between-subjects factor (the intra-/inter-personal condition), and a within-subject factor (the phase mode). In the intra-personal condition, participants bimanually tapped their index fingers, paced by a metronome, with the frequency gradually increasing from 1 Hz to 3 Hz. In the inter-personal condition, pairs of participants were asked to perform the same task, but to use their right or left index finger, while sitting side-by-side and looking at each other’s fingers moving. Analysis showed that the average number of phase transitions, average time-to-transition and standard deviation of the relative phase differed between the intra-personal system and inter-personal system.

We assume that expressing the levels of confidence using human-like expressions will cause users to have a poorer impression of a system than if artificial subtle expressions (ASEs) were used when the quality of the presented information does not match the expressed level of confidence.

2012,Effect of Social Skills on the Asymmetry in Facial Expressions,"This study investigated the effect of social skills on the facial movement asymmetry in facial expressions. Three-dimensional facial landmark data of facial expressions (neutral, happy, and angry) were obtained from Japanese participants (n = 62). After the facial expression task, each participant completed KiSS-18 (Kikuchi’s Scale of Social Skills; Kikuchi, 2007). Through a generalized Procrustes method, facial landmark coordinates and their mirror-reversed versions were represented as points on a hyperplane. The asymmetry of each face was defined as Euclidian distance on the plane. Subtraction of the asymmetry level of a neutral face of each individual from the asymmetry level of a target emotion face was defined as the index of “movement asymmetry” of each emotion. Correlation coefficients of Kiss-18 scores and movement asymmetry scores were computed for both happy and angry expressions. Significant negative correlations between Kiss-18 scores and movement asymmetries were found for both expressions. The results indicate that symmetric facial expressions are higher with higher level of social skills.",>Masashi Komori>Hiroko Kamide>Satoru Kawamura>Chika Nagaoka,>Osaka Electro-Communication University>Osaka University>AIST>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0320/index.html
2012,Reasoning on the Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices Test with Iconic Visual Representations,"Although the problems on Raven’s Progressive Matrices intelligence tests resemble geometric analogies, studies of human behavior suggest the existence of two qualitatively distinct types of strategies: verbal strategies that use propositional representations and visual strategies that use iconic representations. However, all prior computational models implemented to solve these tests have modeled only verbal strategies: they translate problems into purely propositional representations. We examine here the other half of what may be a dual-process mechanism of reasoning in humans: visual strategies that use iconic representations. In particular, we present two different algorithms that use iconic visual representations to address problems found on the Advanced Progressive Matrices test, the best of which yields performances at levels equivalent to the 75th percentile for human test takers aged from 20 to 62 years-old. We discuss implications of our work for understanding the computational nature of Raven’s and visual analogy in problem solving.",>Maithilee Kunda>Keith McGreggor>Ashok Goel,>Georgia Tech>Georgia Tech>Georgia Tech,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0321/index.html

2012,Getting off at the end of the line: the estimation of large numbers,"Despite their importance in public discourse, numbers in the range of one million to one trillion are notoriously difficult to understand. We examine magnitude estimation by adult Americans when placing large numbers on a number line and when qualitatively evaluating descriptions of imaginary geopolitical scenarios. Common conceptions of the number line suggest a logarithmic compression of the numbers (Dehaene, 2003). Theories of abstract concept learning suggest that in situations where direct experience is unavailable, people will use the structure of notation systems as a proxy for the actual system. (Carey, 2009; Landy & Goldstone, 2007). Evaluations across two subject populations largely matched the predictions of the latter account. Approximately 40% of participants estimated one million approximately halfway between one thousand and one billion, but placed numbers linearly across each half, as though they believed that the number words “thousand, million, billion, trillion” constitute a uniformly spaced count list. Very brief training procedures proved partially successful both in correcting number line placement and in shifting participants’ judgments of geopolitical situations.

2012,Tangent Point Orientation and Anticipated Trajectory Curvature – A Field Study on the Visual Control of High Speed Steering,"One visual strategy in the visual control of driving is tangent point orientation – directing gaze to the area of interest (AOI) around the tangent point. Yet there is no consensus on whether the actual gaze target is the tangent point itself – or some other road point in its vicinity - and what the functional significance TP targeting (looking at the tangent point) or TP orientation (looking at a point in the TP AOI, but not necessarily the tangent point) might be. We report a previously unobserved dependence between gaze distribution on road curvature: gaze concentrates on the part of the road where the vehicle yaw rate will be highest. We suggest this geometric property of the future path may act as a functionally salient visual reference for the driver, and that “tangent point orientation” may in some cases be a side-effect caused by the spatial contiguity of these points.",>Otto Lappi>Esko Lehtonen,>University of Helsinki>University of Helsinki,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0324/index.html
2012,Arbitrary Category Labels Can Change Similarity Judgments of Human Faces,"In two experiments, participants were presented with a triad of morphed White and Hispanic faces paired with pseudoword labels. The meanings of these labels were manipulated to represent categorical information about the face. Labels were said to represent either the person’s belief, the food s/he ate, the disease s/he had, or the person’s last name. The results indicated that categorical information affects our judgments of faces. Information categories such as belief, food, and diseases were particularly strong in modifying the participants’ similarity judgment of faces, whereas information characterized with last names of faces were least powerful. Previous research focuses on race face perception being affected primarily by racial indicators or racial information. Our results provide that how we perceptually analyze faces is not confined to obvious racial cues, but by non-racial semantic information as well, suggesting that category-relevant information by itself provides a strong basis for inductive generalization.",>Frankie Lara>Amanda Hahn>Na-Yung Yu>Takashi Yamauchi,>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0325/index.html
2012,A Critical Look at the Findings of Sergent (1982),"It is widely believed that local and global levels of visual stimuli are better processed in the left and right cerebral hemispheres, respectively. One classic explanation for this observation is the spatial frequency hypothesis proposed by Sergent (1982), which states that the left hemisphere is more efficient at processing high spatial frequencies, whereas the right hemisphere is better with low spatial frequencies. Sergent tested this by measuring RTs for laterally presented stimuli (in the left and right visual fields) composed of high and low spatial frequencies and obtained results consistent with the hypothesis. We put Sergent’s findings to the test by replicating her experiment; our first experiment was a direct replication of hers, while the second used the same procedure, but with different stimuli. Our results largely corresponded with those of Sergent, and the crucial interaction between visual field and spatial frequency was obtained in Experiment 1, but was qualitatively different from Sergent’s. Possible explanations are discussed.",>Lyuben Laskin>Meryl Varadinov,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0326/index.html
2012,Neural Correlates of Episodic Memory Formation in Audio-Visual Pairing Tasks,"Understanding episodic memory formation of real-world events is essential for the investigation of human cognition. Most studies have stressed on delimiting the upper boundaries of this memory by using memorization tasks with conditional experimental paradigms, rather than the performance of everyday tasks. However, naturally occurring sensory stimuli are multimodal and dynamic. In an effort to investigate the encoding and retrieval of episodic memory under more naturalistic and ecological conditions, we here demonstrate a memory experiment that employs audio-visual movies as naturalistic stimuli. Electroencephalography measurements were used to analyze neural activations during memory formation. We found that oscillatory activities in the theta frequency bands on the left parietal lobe, and gamma frequency bands on the temporal lobes are related to overall memory formation. Theta and gamma power of the frontal lobes, and gamma power of the occipital lobes were both increased during retrieval tasks. Furthermore, subjects’ memory retrieval performance on the query task was used to clarify our experimental results. Correlation between behavioral differences and neural activation was observed in the same regions. Our results extend the previous results of neurocognitive studies on memory formation via naturalistic stimuli, neural oscillations, and behavioral analysis combined.",>Chung-Yeon Lee>Beom-Jin Lee>Joon Shik Kim>Byoung-Tak Zhang,">Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0327/index.html
2012,Human Cluster Evaluation and Formal Quality Measures: A Comparative Study,"Clustering quality evaluation is an essential component of cluster analysis. Given the plethora of clustering techniques and their possible parameter settings, data analysts require sound means of comparing alternate partitions of the same data. When proposing a novel technique, researchers commonly apply two means of clustering quality evaluation. First, they apply formal Clustering Quality Measures (CQMs) to compare the results of the novel technique with those of previous algorithms. Second, they visually present the resultant partitions of the novel method and invite readers to see for themselves that it uncovers the correct partition. These two approaches are viewed as disjoint and complementary. Our study compares formal CQMs with human evaluations using a diverse set of measures based on a novel theoretical taxonomy. We find that some highly natural CQMs are in sharp contrast with human evaluations while others correlate well. Through a comparison of clustering experts and novices, as well as a consistency analysis, we support the hypothesis that clustering evaluation skill is present in the general population.",>Joshua Lewis>Margareta Ackerman>Virginia de Sa,">University of California, San Diego>University of Waterloo>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0328/index.html
2012,Learning Cluster Analysis through Experience,"The field of machine learning is constantly developing useful new techniques for data analysis, but they are often ignored by researchers outside the field due to unfamiliarity and the difficulty of keeping up with a large body of work. We propose a methodology for training researchers how algorithms work through experience, such that they gain an implicit, rather than explicit, understanding of their function. Thus we combine theory from discovery learning with advanced software and a more educated target population to foster such understanding. We have developed an open source application for exploratory data analysis called Divvy that lets users quickly and visually interact with a range of data analysis techniques. Using a simplified version of Divvy, we find that undergraduate subjects are generally able to learn machine learning concepts through experience, though they have only partial success in applying them.",>Joshua Lewis>Virginia de Sa,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0329/index.html

Participants were asked to solve a set of puzzles while being provided occasional gameplay advice by a robot tutor. Each participant was assigned one of five conditions: (1) no advice, (2) robot providing randomized advice, (3) voice of the robot providing personalized advice, (4) video representation of the robot providing personalized advice, or (5) physically-present robot providing personalized advice. We assess the tutor's effectiveness by the time it takes participants to complete the puzzles. Participants in the robot providing personalized advice group solved most puzzles faster on average and improved their same-puzzle solving time significantly more than participants in any other group. Our study is the first to assess the effect of the physical presence of a robot in an automated tutoring interaction.

Computer simulations have many advantages in teaching science systems. Our research goal is to test whether a hierarchical instructional scaffolding framework embedded in simulation-based learning environments and retrospective mental modeling task could facilitate mental model construction in learning science systems. This pilot study was conducted with a sample of adult learners who didn’t have strong science background. They were asked to learn ideal gas laws in a simulation-based environment. The results show that participants in the hierarchical scaffolding condition performed better than the non-hierarchical scaffolding condition. The retrospective mental modeling task could enhance learning only within the hierarchical scaffolding condition; while in the non-hierarchical scaffolding condition, the task was detrimental to learning. Based on the results from the pilot study, an 8 session curriculum teaching ideal gas laws to middle school students has been designed for our future study.",>Na Li>John Black>Mengzi Gao,">Columbia University, new york>Columbia University, new york>Columbia University, new york",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0331/index.html
2012,A New Angle on the EMPATH Model: Spatial Frequency Orientation in Recognition of Facial Expressions,"Many have investigated the sensitivity of face processing to both spatial frequencies and face orientation, but few have researched the sensitivity of face processing to the orientation of spatial frequencies. One recent exception has been Yu, Chai, & Chung (2011), which investigated facial expression recognition in regards to the orientation of spatial filters and showed that most information is contained in the horizontal orientation. Here, we model the Yu, Chai, & Chung (2011) study using the EMPATH model, a feed-forward neural network that has been used to model facial expression recognition (Dailey, Cottrell, Padgett, & Adolphs 2002). We used the NimStim set of facial expressions, which were the basis for the Yu, Chai, & Chung (2011) experiment, and followed their method of filtering images through different spatial orientations.

Eliciting experts' visual strategies will benefit image understanding by transferring human domain knowledge into image-based computational procedures. In this paper, an experiment conducted to collect both eye movement and verbal description data from three groups of subjects with different medical training levels (eleven board-certified dermatologists, four dermatologists in training and thirteen novices) while they were examining and describing 42 photographic dermatological images. We present a hierarchical probabilistic framework to discover the stereotypical and idiosyncratic viewing behaviors exhibited within each group when they are diagnosing medical images. Furthermore, experts' annotations of thought units on the transcribed verbal descriptions are time-aligned with discovered eye movement patterns to interpret their semantic meanings. By mapping eye movement patterns to thought units, we uncover the manner in which these subjects alternated their behaviors over the course of inspection and how these experts parse the images.",>Rui Li>Jeff Pelz>Pengcheng Shi>Anne Haake,">Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, United States>Rochester Institute of Technology>Rochester Institute of Technology>Rochester Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0333/index.html
2012,Multimodal Temporal Perception in Musicians: Evidence for Both Segregated and Supramodal Attentional Systems?,"Although musical training has been correlated with modulations of early perceptual and attentional processes, the majority of investigations neglect the possibility of cross modality enhancements. We investigated the effects of musical training by measuring spatial and temporal attention in a temporal order judgment task in auditory, visual, and crossmodal conditions with and without non-predictive cues. In Experiment 1, musicians had lower detection thresholds when compared to controls in all conditions (marginal in auditory). Experiment 2 showed mixed findings, with musicians demonstrating reduced capture from visual cues on the visual task compared to controls, and lower detection thresholds on the auditory task with visual cues. Adding spatial cues to the temporal order judgment tasks increased temporal thresholds for both groups, but only when they occurred within the same modality as the task, and not when presented in a different modality. The findings support both supramodal and segregated accounts of attentional resources.",>Ahnate Lim>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0334/index.html
2012,Reexamining Visual Orientation Anisotropies: A Bias Towards Simple Horizontal Stimuli on Temporal Order Judgments,"Although not currently a widely accepted notion, evidence suggests an anisotropy between horizontal and vertical orientations in visual processing. While there is evidence of an early neurological bias due to a greater number of cortical neurons tuned to the horizontal orientation, recent behavioral evidence suggests a “horizontal effect”, where performance for broadband horizontal stimuli is worse compared to vertical and oblique. Importantly however, this effect has only been observed for complex stimuli and is speculated to counterbalance for the greater occurrence of horizontal stimuli in the environment. In this experiment, we used a staircase temporal order judgment task in three spatial configurations (horizontal, vertical, and both) to test for 1) a bias towards either horizontal or vertical simple stimuli, and 2) whether performance would vary across different planes of stimuli presentation. A bias towards horizontal stimuli was observed, but only when presented in the horizontal plane.

We provide a computational-level theory which interprets rule induction in Raven's as Bayesian inference. The model computes the posterior probability of each rule in the set of possible rule hypotheses based on whether those rules could have generated the features of the objects in the matrix and the prior probability of each rule. Based on fits to both correct and incorrect response options across both the Standard and Advanced Progressive Matrices, we propose several novel mechanisms that may drive responding to Raven's items.",>Daniel R.

2012,Easing and rising of tension from presence of others in player-observer turn-taking in a driving video game: A near-infrared spectroscopy study,"Social facilitation and social support literature, diverging with regards to increasing versus decreasing of an individual’s tension, apprehend different aspects of “the presence of others.” To examine the neural correlates of social presence effects, whether “the presence of others” increases or decreases an individual’s tension, we measured prefrontal activation while participants performed a driving video game task using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Participants were divided into single and paired groups, and then sub-divided according to their game proficiency (high and low). The participant’s task was to drive from start to goal with a default route map without an observer (single group) or under observation by an acquainted partner (paired group). The paired participants alternated their player-observer roles in a turn-taking style (Driver first and Observer second: D1-O2; Observer first and Driver second: O1-D2). The behavioral data demonstrated that, regardless of game proficiency, D1 in the paired group yielded fewer errors and longer driving time than single players, while no differences were found between D1 and D2. The tension evaluation scores in single players and D2 were higher than D1. In turn, the NIRS data revealed that, in low-proficiency players, single players and D2 who first observed D1’s performance showed higher activation than D1, but neither did so in high-proficiency players. These results suggest that the presence of an acquainted partner (O1) functions positively to reduce an individual’s (D1) tension in low-proficiency players. However, prior observation of another’s performance may negate the positive social presence effect leading to an increase of tension in the subsequent task.",>Tao Liu>Hirofumi Saito>Misato Oi>Matthew Pelowski,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0337/index.html
2012,Intentionality of Strong Anticipation in Motor Behaviors,"Pezzulo (2008) and Grush (1997, 2004, 2007) highlight, even insist, the role of representation and internal models in anticipatory systems, in contrast to the role of adaptivity in the so-called ‘mere adaptive systems’. The present paper argues against their claim, by alternatively arguing that the strong anticipation—anticipation without employing internal models—is primordial in the making of the anticipatory behavior, while internal models are supplementary in the light of efficiency. A novel notion of intentionality is raised for strong anticipatory behaviors, based on the history of on-line adjustments. The supplement of internal models on the top of a strong anticipatory system makes the resulting anticipatory system a Popperian machine, and consequently more flexibile.",>Daniel Hsi-wen Liu,>Providence University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0338/index.html

We claim that the only motivation for recursion, the infinity in natural language and arithmetic competence, is equally approachable by iteration and recursion. Second, we submit that the infinity in natural language and arithmetic competence reduces to imagining infinite embedding or concatenation, which is completely independent from the ability to implement infinite computation, and thus, independent from both recursion and iteration. Furthermore, we show that natural language is a finite rather than infinite set.",>Erkki Luuk>Hendrik Luuk,">University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia>University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0340/index.html
2012,Modelling the IAT: Implicit Association Test Reflects Shallow Linguistic Environment and not Deep Personal Attitudes,"People often have thoughts, attitudes and biases that are not themselves consciously aware of or that they would rather not share with others. To assess such attitudes, researchers use paradigms like the Implicit Association Test (IAT) that do not rely on explicit responding to determine the level of bias a person holds towards a particular target concept (e.g., race, gender, age). Responses in the IAT are assumed to reflect deeply held beliefs and attitudes, and not shallow, superficial associations. However, as linguistic distributional information has been shown to serve as a viable heuristic in many cognitive tasks, we investigated whether it could be used to predict the level of bias established by the IAT. We used a large corpus of language (Web 1T) and data from 16 IAT studies (N = 1825) to examine whether the degree of linguistic co-occurrence for target concepts and attributes reflected the size of bias observed in human behavioural data. We found that the effect size of the linguistic biases corresponded strongly with the effect sizes from the behavioural data. We suggest that language reflects prevalent cultural attitudes which are captured by tasks such as the IAT, suggesting that the IAT may reflect shallow, linguistic associations rather than deeper conceptual processing.",>Dermot Lynott>Himanshu Kansal>Louise Connell>Kerry O'Brien,>University of Manchester>University of Manchester>University of Manchester>Monash University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0341/index.html
2012,External Working Memory and the Amount of Distributed Cognition,"While processing of a large number of (visuo-spatial) items are oftentimes necessary for ongoing cognitive activities, the biological working memory can process only about four items of information. Then it is a mystery how we cope with complex world situations. This is the paradox of working memory. This paradox is solved once we view the external features of the world as constituting part of working memory. Part of working memory is externally distributed iff the external features of the world constitute part of material supervenience base of working memory. Tversky’s Spractions (2010), or actions onto the world, are the key to offload of cognition, because they redirect the attention at the working memory level only to relevant aspects of the world. To see how people use spractions to offload working memory load, subjects were asked to build a Lego block in front of a camera. Using cognitive ethnography, it was observed that they all relied on spractions to cognize. From the fact that the biological working memory can process only about four items of information, the amount of working memory based distributed cognition can be calculated.",>Naoki Maeda,>Columbia University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0342/index.html

Hence when there is uncertainty over aspects of evidence this should be factored into juror judgments. Two experiments examined how mock jurors used uncertain information in their ratings of defendant guilt and final verdicts. Participants read scenarios where an eyewitness expressed uncertainty about the identity of a critical piece of evidence (e.g. the object a defendant was holding could have been a knife or a mobile phone). The respective probability of these alternatives was varied, as was their association with the alleged crime. When the probability of the alternatives was varied between subjects (Experiment 1) there was only weak evidence that jurors considered both alternatives. When probability was varied within-subjects (Experiment 2), jurors did consider both alternatives in their guilt judgments.

In this view, people intervene on each variable within their model and assign blame in proportion to how much a change to a variable would have improved the outcome. This approach raises two questions: First, what structure do people use to represent a given situation? Second, how do they choose what alternatives to consider when intervening on an event? We use a series of coin-tossing scenarios to compare empirical data to different models within the proposed framework. The results suggest that people sample their intervention values from a prior rather than deterministically switching the value of a variable.

We use a continuous testing paradigm instead of an experiment-final test battery to reveal the trajectory of learning and to allow detailed comparison with three computational models of word segmentation.

The ``Linda'' problem is a well-known example, which often elicits a conjunction/disjunction fallacy: probability of constituent event A (B) judged more/less likely than their conjunction/disjunction. The Quantum Judgment model (QJM, Busemeyer et al 2011) explains such errors, which are not explainable within classical probability theory. We propose an alternative axiomatic approach in the framework of quantum probability theory that employs positive operators representing the set of general queries, in constast to QJM which uses projection operators. Like QJM, our model accounts for conjunction/disjunction fallacies, averaging type errors, and unpacking effects, suggesting that it provides a viable model of judgement error.

In particular, endogenous task switching is thought to differ qualitatively from stimulus-triggered exogenous task switching. However, no previous study has examined the neural substrate of endogenous task switching. The purpose of the present study is to explore the differences between event-related potential responses to exogenous and endogenous rule switching at cue stimulus. We modified two patterns of cued switching tasks: exogenous (bottom-up) rule switching and endogenous (top-down) rule switching. In each task cue stimulus was configured in order to induce switching or maintaining rule. In Exogenous switching tasks, late positive deflection was larger in the switch rule condition than in the maintain rule condition. However, in endogenous switching tasks late positive deflection was unexpectedly lager in the maintain rule condition than in the switch rule condition. These results indicate that exogenous rule switching is explicit stimulus-driven processes whereas endogenous rule switching is implicitly parallel processes independent of external stimulus.",>Maki Miyajima>Atuhito Toyomaki>Ichiro Kusumi>Tsukasa Koyama,>Hokkaido University>Hokkaido University>Hokkaido University>Hokkaido University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0353/index.html

Individual differences in children’s understanding of first- and second-order false belief and understanding of hidden negative emotion were associated with differences in language ability. Individual differences in understanding of first-order false belief and understanding of hidden negative emotion were correlated, and this association remained after controlling age and language ability. The results also showed that children who were more advanced in understanding of first-order false belief are more likely to have fewer peer problems.

This study aimed to determine if this processing feature of native Japanese readers influenced their process of lexical access by lexical decision tasks using visually misleading transposed-letter (TL) nonwords, phonologically misleading pseudohomophones, and standard nonwords. Lupker and Pexman (2010) found that the performance on a lexical decision task of native English readers was impaired by both TL nonwords and pseudohomophones. However, the results of two experiments in this study showed that the performance of native Japanese readers was impaired not by pseudohomophones but by TL nonwords. The results suggested that the processing features of native readers of various languages should influence their process of lexical access.",>Rika Mizuno>Takao Matsui,>Chubu University>Chubu University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0355/index.html
2012,The Effects of Mental Imagery and Embodied Action on L2 Word Learning,"Previous research has provided evidence that mental imagery and embodied action can facilitate word learning in a novel language. However, it is unclear how these factors interact—as well as why they play a role—in word learning. Through a set of four experiments, this research demonstrated that neither mental imagery nor embodied action directly promotes the acquisition of second language (L2) words by adult learners. Notably, both passive viewing of images and gestures, as well as active engagement in mental imagery and gesture enactment, were insufficient to enhance L2 word learning. These results suggest that adults are effective L2 word learners, and that, because of this, embodied action does not play an essential role in supporting L2 lexical acquisition.",>Laura Morett>Ray Gibbs>Brian MacWhinney,">University of Pittsburgh>University of California, Santa Cruz>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0356/index.html
2012,How the Hands Cue the Mind: The Effects of Iconicity and Enactment on Sign Language Acquisition,"Iconicity is a powerful cue to symbolic meaning. However, it is unclear from previous research whether language learners benefit from iconicity. Prior research indicates that the motor system supports language acquisition, suggesting that iconicity expressed via this modality may be particularly salient. The present study investigates the effects of iconicity and enactment on the acquisition of American Sign Language by hearing adults. The results reveal that enactment enhances sign learning in general, but fail to show that iconic signs are learned more effectively than non-iconic signs. As such, they indicate that the motor system—but not iconicity—plays a key role in sign language acquisition.",>Laura Morett,>University of Pittsburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0357/index.html
2012,Does thinking make you biased? The case of the engineers and lawyers problem.,"In this study we examined the cognitive processes involved in engineers and lawyers-type problems, using a novel method (i.e., asking for liking ratings). We were particularly interested in how participants process information about personality descriptions and base rates, which are provided in the problems. In line with previous research, we found that people detect the conflict between descriptions and base rates. Nevertheless, when instructed to reason logically, instead of relying on base rates, participants resolved the conflict by showing higher preference for description-based responses.",>Kinga Morsanyi>Simon Handley,>University of Cambridge>University of Plymouth,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0358/index.html

2012,Cognitive Styles in Two Cognitive Sciences,"Miller (1990) suggests that communication between linguistics and psychology is hampered for essentially cognitive reasons: linguists favor simplifying explanations while psychologists favor causal explanations. This paper reformulates this suggestion as three testable hypotheses. First, scientists vary in cognitive style from rationalist/nomological to empiricist/mechanistic. Second, linguistics is primarily a rationalist/nomological science, while psychology is primarily an empiricist/mechanistic one. Strikingly, even among nativists, linguistic and psychological research still contrast along the rationalist/empiricist dimension. Third, cognitive styles are relatively intractable, as suggested by empirical evidence that they are associated with intrinsic individual differences and by formal arguments that highlight their self-isolating nature.",>James Myers,">National Chung Cheng University, Minhsiung, Chiayi, Taiwan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0361/index.html
2012,Process of Improvisational Contemporary Dance,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the process of improvisational contemporary dance. To achieve this goal, we combine two types of methodology: analysis of data from interviews with dancers and analysis of their dance performances. Our findings reveal that while dancing, in order to create their movements, improvisational dancers interact with various stimuli that come from inside and outside of themselves (for example, images and feelings that they entertain during their dancing, and the music, space and audience of their dance performances). Through such interactions, dancers organize movements in their performances extemporarily, using various expressive techniques (for example, changing speed or image intentionally and seeing themselves from the viewpoint of a third person).",>Yuko Nakano>Takeshi Okada,>University of Tokyo>University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0362/index.html
2012,Learning Containment Metaphors,"We present a computational approach that traces the developmental process, from containment image schemas to metaphor, in four phases: a) perceptual discovery of image schemas, b) associating the participants with linguistic units, c) discovering a linguistic structure encoding the schema, and finally d) identifying the distribution of such metaphor usage in a corpus. In the first three phases, we use no prior knowledge about either the perceptual or language domains; in the corpus analysis, we use the WordNet ontology. Our initial image schema, involving a trajector, container and the relation model is correlated with co-occurring commentaries to yield containment-preposition associations through recurring patterns. We then use selectional restrictions to identify the classes of the container words, the most common being location (66%), followed by group membership (20%), time, and cognition (17% each). This process suggests a mechanism whereby language may help refine the initial perceptual image schema.",>Sushobhan Nayak>Amitabha Mukerjee,>IIT Kanpur>IIT Kanpur,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0363/index.html
2012,Interaction of Word Learning and Semantic Category Formation in Late Talking,"Late talkers (LTs) — children who show a marked delay in vocabulary learning — have also been shown to differ from normally-developing (ND) children with respect to the semantic organization of their learned vocabulary. We use a computational model of word learning to study how individual differences between LTs and NDs give rise to differences in abstract knowledge of categories emerging from learned words, and how this affects their subsequent word learning. Our results suggest that the vocabulary composition of LTs and NDs differ at least partially due to a deﬁcit in the attentional abilities of LTs, which also results in the learning of weaker abstract knowledge of semantic categories of words.",>Aida Nematzadeh>Afsaneh Fazly>Suzanne Stevenson,>University of Toronto>University of Toronto>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0364/index.html

Here, the same model was used to simulate findings from an experiment in which perceptual load effects were attributed to distractor dilution (Benoni & Tsal, 2010). By modeling at the neural level the continuous inhibitory interactions that take place among visual stimuli competing for cortical representation, the model reproduced successfully the behavioural pattern of results.

2012,A Cultural Decision-Making Model for Negotiation based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"We learn culture-specific weights for a multi-attribute model of decision-making in negotiation, using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). The model considers multiple individual and social factors for evaluating the available choices in a decision set, and attempts to account for observed behavior differences across cultures by the different weights that members of those cultures place on each factor. We apply this model to the Ultimatum Game and show that weights learned from IRL surpass both a simple baseline with random weights, and a high baseline that only seeks to maximize gain in own wealth in accounting for the behavior of human players from four different cultures. We also show that the weights learned with our model for one culture outperform weights learned for other cultures when playing against opponents of the first culture. We conclude that decision-making in negotiation is a complex, culture-specific process that can be learned using IRL techniques.",>Elnaz Nouri>Kallirroi Georgila>David Traum,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0366/index.html
2012,State effects of action video-game playing on visuospatial processing efficiency and attention among experienced action video-game players,"Although researchers have speculated action video gaming might induce the state of “flow experience”, most previous experimental studies have focused primarily on the long-term (trait) effects of action video gaming, while overlooking possible short-term (state) effects characterizing the “flow” state. The goal of the current research was to investigate the state effects of action video games on visual-spatial processing efficiency and visual-spatial attention. We compared the baseline performance of experienced action video game players on two visual-spatial tasks and Attention Network Test with their performance on these tasks immediately after action video-gaming. The findings indicate half an hour of action video-game playing temporarily boosted participants’ performances on tasks that require visual memory, spatial transformations (mental rotation), and executive network of attention. The existence of such enhanced cognitive states implies the possibility of consciously accessing the latent resources of our brain and boosting our attentional and visual capacity upon demand.",>Takashi Obana>Maria Kozhevnikov,>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0367/index.html
2012,Variation of Characteristics of Reading and Writing Difficulties in Japanese Children with Learning Disabilities,"There are conflicting hypotheses for the causes of Dyslexia in reading and writing difficulties, such as the phonological deficit hypothesis, double deficit hypothesis, magnocellular deficits hypothesis etc. The cause of the difficulties may vary between individuals. Moreover, most of these hypotheses consider only a single disability, despite the fact that factors related to reading and writing may affect the difficulty in various ways. We conducted this study to identify individual differences in the effect of Dyslexia. The participants were 12 Japanese children who were diagnosed with learning disabilities or suspected to be learning disabled. In this study, we considered how phonological awareness, visual perception, and phonological processing are related to reading and writing abilities in the Japanese language. In addition, we checked “handwriting ability.” This study shows that reading and writing difficulties are caused by a variety of factors and that there are individual differences in the difficulties.",>Shino Ogawa>Miwa Fukushima-Murata>Namiko Kubo-Kawai>Tomoko Asai>Hiroko Taniai>Nobuo Masataka,>Kyoto University>The University of Tokyo>Aichi Shukutoku University>Nagoya City Child Welfare Center>Nagoya Central Care Center for Disabled Children>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0368/index.html

In previous work, we proposed a method to dynamically estimate emphasizing points (DEEP) based on utterances, physiological indices, and proposal selections. To evaluate this method in actual interactions, we conducted controlled WoZ (Wizard of Oz) experiments using Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), which interactively provide controlled information for decision-making. Using ECAs, we compare our method to an existing method, which estimates emphasizing factors through the “gradual method”.

Previous studies reporting this relationship have required participants to make explicit decisions about the meaning of the target words including these vowels. In the present study, we attempted to re-examine the vowel-size relationship in two experiments using speeded classification tasks. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that participants associated the vowels with a bigger/smaller image even when they were not motivated to pronounce the vowels during the task. The results of Experiment 2 indicate that the proprioception of the absolute size of the mouth may not contribute to the vowel-size relationship.

Participants came from a range of English language proficiency levels. Our goal was to test whether scores from these two treatments (English EI scores and working memory scores) would correlate significantly. If not, this would suggest that there is some difference in what they measure. The results did fail to show a significant correlation between working memory and English EI scores.

2012,Changing Discriminatory Norms Using Models of Conceptually-Mediated Cognition and Cultural Worldviews,"Cognitive modeling can provide immense social benefits, especially in the case of unconscious processes causing significant psychological and societal distress. One such process, discrimination against minorities, is typically grounded in unconsciously held stereotypes reflecting deep ignorance of the realities minorities face. Another, suicide terrorism, results in significant suffering for many communities. Related beliefs often arise from unquestionable values, norms and worldviews, however, making direct/conscious change appeals unworkable. Building upon cultural knowledge representation and cognitive modeling, this paper shows how change could be effected via cognitive operations on conceptual worldviews. After introducing a novel framework for modeling conceptually-mediated belief systems and techniques for guided dissonance reduction and network change, the paper applies these to anti-discrimination and terrorism reduction. Such work holds great potential for better aligning perception of minorities with the realities they face, reducing suffering, and disrupting psychological processes dependent on improper views of stigmatized minorities and other phenomena.",>Daniel Olsher,">Temasek Laboratories, National University of Singapore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0373/index.html
2012,The Role of Comparison Processes in the Induction of Schemas for Design Styles,"Considerable evidence supports the effectiveness of close comparison of examples as a means to promote the induction of schemas that support generalization, especially to novel cases that require far transfer. The ease of comparison would appear to be maximized by presenting the to-be-compared cases in close spatial and temporal proximity. However, find-ings from a number of recent studies have been interpreted as evidence that induction is fostered not by presenting training cases for a single category together (massed practice), but ra-ther by presenting them in an interspersed fashion (spaced practice). We address this apparent paradox in a study in which people are asked to learn the “styles” of furniture de-signs from a small number of examples of different products (e.g., a bed frame) and then classify examples of entirely dif-ferent products (e.g., a chandelier). We contrasted a learning procedure based on comparison of examples presented simul-taneously with procedures involving processing of individual items, either massed or spaced. Study time was minimized, and generalization was maximized, when learning was based on comparison. In a further study we use structural equation modeling to assess the content of the schemas for visual styles that are acquired by comparison processes. We propose that comparison fosters induction, whereas spacing facilitates re-tention and retrieval.",>Takanobu Omata>Keith Holyoak,">University of California, LA>University of California, LA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0374/index.html

Moreover, we extend the basic framework to a circulative generation mechanism with a simple mutation function. Through the preliminary performance checks, we confirmed that the transformation of story worlds and story lines is approximately logically adequate and the circular process produces the diversity of stories. The proposed system is a module in an integrated narrative generation system and the pilot version is already implemented. In the context of the narrative generation system, the proposed system plays roles for expanding the variation of discourse to be generated and limiting possible narrative elements at any given time in a narraive generation process.",>Kou Onodera>Taisuke Akimoto>Takashi Ogata,">Iwate Prefectural University, Takizawa, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Takizawa, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Takizawa, Iwate, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0375/index.html

We provide students with the opportunities to explore algebraic structure by physically manipulating and interacting with concrete and virtual symbolic systems that enforce rules through constraints on physical transformations. Here we present an instantiation of this approach aimed at helping students learn the structure of algebraic notation in general, and in particular learn to simplify like terms.

The model provides a functional account of how these sensemaking processes are carried out in a cognitive architecture, and model performance can be compared to normative (Bayesian) standards.

2012,Can native-language perceptual bias facilitate learning words in a new language?,"Acquiring a language relies on distinguishing the sounds and learning mappings between meaning and phonetic forms. Yet, as shown in previous research on child language acquisition, the ability to discriminate between similar sounds does not guarantee success at learning words contrasted by those sounds. We investigated whether adults, in contrast to young infants, are able to attend to phonetic detail when learning similar words in a new language. We tested speakers of Korean and Mandarin to see whether they could use their native-language-specific perceptual biases in a word-learning task. Results revealed that participants were not able to fully capitalize on their perceptual abilities: only faster learners – as independently assessed by baseline trials – showed enhanced learning involving contrasts in phonetic dimensions informative in their native language. This suggests that attention to phonetic detail when learning words might only be possible for adults with better learning skills or higher motivation.",>Bozena Pajak>Sarah Creel>Roger Levy,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0379/index.html

Three- and four-year-olds were presented with a modified version of the change-of-location story in which two characters are the focus of interest. In the contrastive access condition preschoolers’ observe that one character leaves the room while the other stays and witnesses the moving event; in the non-contrastive condition both characters leave the room and fail to observe the moving event. Despite having to track two different characters and their different knowledge states about the location of the toy, preschoolers were more likely to succeed on the task when the characters had contrasting access to the moving event. This result supports a previously unexplored qualitative prediction of the Goodman et al (2006) computational model of the false-belief task and also provides tentative support for the theory theory view of the false-belief transition.",>Kathie Pham>Elizabeth Bonawitz>Alison Gopnik,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>U C Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0380/index.html

They introduced Likert-scales to test this hypothesis. We conducted a study with a within subjects design in which we compare children’s binary and scalar responses to the same underinformative sentences. We also used two separate tasks to look at the effects of task difficulty on performance. The results show that the more difficult task, Euler circles, lead to less pragmatic responses compared to the easier task, drawings. Confirming the study by Katsos and Smith (2010; see also Katsos & Bishop, 2011) children choose the middle options on the scale more when they are confronted with underinformative sentences and they choose more extreme options for the control sentences.

We can easily accept that a few books might be 10 books, yet a lot of smartphones might only be 4 smartphones. The current paper posits that there are two hypotheses that can explain can explain this context dependency: the Definite Number Hypothesis (DNH), and the Gradable Quantifier Hypothesis (GQH). The DNH suggests that the term a few corresponds to a definite range of values, and may pick out a larger quantity only if the range seems implausible for the given context. The GQH suggests that context-dependency is actually built into the meaning of a few. Experiment 1 supports the intuition that there is variability in the quantity that a few picks out based on context.

Using a previously proposed computational model of human performance on the Implicit Association Test, we examine possible processing mechanisms in which cognitive fluency and stereotype threat could influence the processing of implicit attitudes.

This is achieved by augmenting the model with a learning mechanism based on a modified Heb-bian learning rule that adapts associative strengths between concepts depending on the temporal proximity of their activa-tion. By manipulating the frequencies at which different stim-uli are paired and presented as input to the network, we demonstrate how virtual subjects could acquire associative strengths that were subsequently reflected in simulated IATs as stronger relative preferences in favor of targets that were more frequently presented with positively-valenced stimuli.

Little research so far focused on a combination of two central fields important for successful route planning: the way humans deal with constraint based reasoning (especially with some sort of spatio-temporal constraints) and the way in which humans plan with a given map (especially with problems inspired by typical Traveling Salesman Problems). This, however, becomes even more interesting in cases in which the spatio-temporal constraints allow for several solutions. Do the predictions of the preferred mental model theory still hold true in such situations? This article investigates the influence of maps on the generation of preferred models.

2012,Think Outside the Box: The Effects of Cognitive Training on Creative Problem Solving,"Problem solving requires the use of higher mental functions, functions that can be improved with training. The current study examines the effects of meditation on creative problem solving. Participants were undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to meditate or rest. Next, Pp were asked to solve a problem: fishing out a small object from inside a box using one of four available tools. Two of the available tools were potentially useful, but the other two were intentionally designed to be useless (i.e., they were incapable of retrieving the object). There were no differences between meditators and non-meditators with respect to solution rates, tool switching behavior, or overall persistence. However, meditators spent more time with their first tool that they selected, and more time attempting to solve the task with the useful tools. Brief meditation training may promote certain cognitive strategies that are conducive to successful problem solving; implications are discussed.",>Jared Ramsburg>Robert Youmans,>University of Illinois at Chicago>George Mason University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0387/index.html
2012,"Changing Global Warming Beliefs with Scientific Information: Knowledge, Attitudes, and RTMD (Reinforced Theistic Manifest Destiny Theory)","Unlike peer nations’ residents, Americans are less accepting of, and concerned by, (especially anthropogenic) climate change. Reinforced Theistic Manifest Destiny theory (RTMD; e.g., Ranney, 2012) explains many such “U.S.-exceptionalist” phenomena by combining geopolitical history with six belief constructs: afterlife, deity, nationalism, creation, evolution, and global warming. We assess predictions that climate change acceptance is increased by mechanism-explaining interventions. A 270-participant survey established widespread mechanistic ignorance, and an experiment with 149 other Americans (Californians and Texans) showed that a 400-word description of climate change’s mechanism dramatically reduced ignorance and increased climate change acceptance. The mechanism, briefly, is: (a) Earth’s surface absorbs (mostly visible) sunlight and subsequently emits infrared light, which (b) greenhouse gases selectively absorb and retain (because these molecules can become asymmetrical), so (c) heat energy leaves more slowly, warming Earth. Our intervention yielded desirable conceptual changes and science-coherent attitude changes.

2012,Evidence that Threatening Situations Enhance Creativity,"We tested the hypothesis that threatening situations enhance creativity. 60 participants viewed a series of photographs and rated them on level of threat. They then wrote two short stories: one based on the photograph they rated as most threatening, and the other based on the photograph they rated as least threatening. The stories were rated for level of creativity. Paired samples t-testså revealed that stories based on threatening pictures produced a higher degree of creativity than those based on non-threatening pictures. Theoretical frameworks consistent with these findings are discussed.",>Sean Riley>Liane Gabora,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0389/index.html
2012,Automatic selection of eye tracking variables in visual categorization for adults and infants,"Visual categorization and learning of visual categories exhibit early onset, however the underlying mechanisms of early categorization are not well understood. The main limiting factor for examining these mechanisms is the limited duration of infant cooperation (10-15 minutes), which leaves little room for multiple test trials. With its tight link to visual attention, eye tracking is a promising method for getting access to the mechanisms of category learning. But how should researchers decide which aspects of the rich eye tracking data to focus on? To date, eye tracking variables are generally handpicked, often resulting in biases of the eye tracking data. Here, we propose an automated method for selecting eye tracking variables based on their usefulness to discriminate learners from non-learners of visual categories. We presented infants and adults with a category learning task and tracked their eye movements. We then extracted an over-complete set of eye tracking variables encompassing durations, probabilities, latencies, and the order of fixations and saccadic eye movements. We applied the statistical technique of ANOVA ranking to identifying those variables among this large set that covaried with the learner/non-learner label. We were able to identify learners and non-learners above chance level using linear SVM and the top eye tracking variables.",>Samuel Rivera>Catherine Best>Hyungwook Yim>Aleix Martinez>Vladimir Sloutsky>Dirk Walther,">The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0390/index.html
2012,Categorisation in High and Low Schizotypes,"Disorders provide an important source of information in developing theories of normal categorisation. Disruption in categorisation in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia has been widely evidenced. However, findings are often contradictory and subject to significant confounds. In the present study 35 high schizotypes and 35 low scorers completed a semantic categorisation task and a borderline categorisation task, with measures of category membership judgment, similarity and response time being taken. Results revealed that high schizotypes made significantly fewer positive category membership judgments than low schizotypes (p = .003) and suggest that different theoretical explanations may be required to explain the categorisation of high and low schizotypes. Explanations in terms of theories of normal categorisation are developed.",>Aaron Roberts>Nick Braisby,>University of Winchester>University of Winchester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0391/index.html
2012,Inferring Metaphoric Structure from Financial Articles Using Bayesian Sparse Models,"Drawing from a large corpus (17,000+ arti­cles) of financial news, we perform a Bayesian sparse model analysis of the argu­ment-distributions of the UP and DOWN-verbs, used to describe movements in indices, stocks and shares. Previous work, by Gerow and Keane (2011a, 2011b, 2011c), has shown, that metaphor hierarchies and antonymic relations can be found in this data. In the present paper, we re-analyzed their data using a Bayesian sparse model (Lake & Tenen­baum, 2010) in order to infer the metaphor space as a uniform representation, based on the argument distributions. Therefore, we treated arguments as fea­tures of metaphors. Our model learned three dimensional graphs in an unsu­pervised manner as sparse representations of the meta­phoric structure over all argument distributions, in parallel. Doing so, it also successfully indicates the metaphoric hierarchies and antonymy relations, that were found by the previous models. In conclusion, we discuss the benefits of this approach.",>Martin Sälzle>Mark Keane,>Central European University>University College Dublin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0392/index.html
2012,Conceptual Change through Socially Constructive Interaction in the Classroom,"While collaborative learning is prevailing in schools, most of its research focuses mainly on small group collaborative processes, in one shot practice. In order to investigate the nature and the mechanism of the collaborative learning in a larger group, this paper presents analyses of a classroom in which 21 third-graders collaboratively discussed predictions about the results of a series of experiments as a whole class over twelve course hours and became able to grasp a rudimentary scientific concept of the atomic theory. We analyzed their levels of achievement, conversation patterns, selection sequences of predictions, and the contents of the utterances. The results revealed that all of the children succeeded in expressing their grasp of a rudimentary scientific concept, yet their routes to the achievement were diverse. A preliminary qualitative analysis of two children’s utterances shows that while their models were similar during the first half of the course, their differences became more explicit toward the end, which resulted in intense discussion between the two in front of the other children. The diversity observed in the entire course of this class and emphasized toward the end by these two children’s explicit, focused dialogue could have contributed to the successful conceptual change for the entire class members.",>Moegi Saito>Naomi Miyake,>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0393/index.html
2012,Strategy Changes in Causal Structure Learning: The Role of Task Complexity,"Saito and Shimazaki (2012) found that people rely upon covariation information rather than temporal order information as cues to causal structure, whereas Lagnado and Sloman (2006) reported an opposite finding, indicating relatively greater influence of temporal order cues. The present research examines the hypothesis that such conflicting findings result from differences in task complexity. Specifically, it is proposed that covariation information becomes less influential as the number of variables increases. Experiment 1 investigated the relationship between the judgment strategy (i.e., covariation vs. temporal order) and the number of variables comprising a causal structure. As a result, people favored covariation cues primarily in tasks with simple causal structure. Experiment 2 used more complex causal structure. The results demonstrated that the tendency to emphasize covariation cues or to rely upon temporal order cues changes as a function of task complexity. These results were consistent with both previous findings and discussed in terms of causal Bayes net theories and heuristic models.",>Motoyuki Saito>Tsuneo Shimazaki,>Kwansei Gakuin University>Kwansei Gakuin University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0394/index.html
2012,The Comprehension of Adjective Metaphors Is Selectively Affected By Negative Meanings Associated With Adjectives As Vehicles,"Previous metaphor studies have paid much attention to nominal metaphors and predicative metaphors and little attention has been given to adjective metaphors. The most adjective metaphor studies have only examined how the acceptability of adjective metaphors can be explained by the pairing of adjective modifier’s and head noun’s modalities. Sakamoto & Utsumi (2009) showed that adjective metaphors, especially those modified by color adjectives, tend to evoke negative meanings. Sumihisa et al (2011) examined whether evoking negative meanings is the unique feature of adjective metaphors through comparison among nominal metaphors and predicative metaphors for the Japanese language and revealed that meanings of metaphors are basically affected by meanings of vehicles, but when vehicles themselves had neutral meanings, negative meanings were evoked more frequently for adjective metaphors among the other types of metaphors. The purpose of this study, therefore, explores the reason why adjective metaphors evoke negative meanings more frequently than the other types of metaphors. For this purpose, we examined what kind of meanings associated with topics or vehicles affect the comprehension of metaphors. Our psychological experiments revealed that meanings associated from vehicles affect the comprehension of metaphors. And when metaphorical expressions have vehicles with positive or negative meanings, metaphorical expressions show the same meanings as the vehicles. On the other hand, when metaphorical expressions have vehicles with neutral meaning, only adjective metaphors evoke negative meanings. Our results suggest that the comprehension of adjective metaphors is selectively affected by the negative meanings associated with adjectives as vehicles.",>Maki Sakamoto>Miho Sumihisa>Takuya Matsumoto>Akira Utsumi,>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0395/index.html

A field research was carried out in the field of algorithmic problem solving and in the reasoning domain, followed by constructing a software cognitive model to represent the findings.

2012,Shared Book Reading between Mother and Infant Facilitates The Frequency of Joint Attention,"This study examines the effect of shared book reading on mother-infant joint attention interactions in infancy. In experiment 1, pairs composed of 9-month-old infants and their mothers (N = 10) were observed in three conditions: the shared-book, toy-play, and no-material condition. The results indicate a frequency of passive joint and coordinated joint attention in the shared book context than in others. Experiment 2 longitudinally investigated the effect of increasing the time of shared book reading on the frequency of passive and coordinated joint attention. Twenty-eight pairs of 9-month-old infants and their mothers were randomly assigned to one of two groups; the first was a shared book reading condition (N = 11), in which mothers were asked to share books every day and were given picture books regularly from the first observation (at 9 months) until the second observation (at 12 months). In the control group (N = 11), mothers were given no instruction. The results show that increasing shared book reading increases the frequency of passive joint attention. Therefore, it is suggested that shared book reading increases joint attention episodes and that repeated shared book reading increases it in other contexts.",>Ayumi Sato>Ichiro Uchiyama,>Doshisha University>Doshisha University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0397/index.html

A computational model is developed with different patterns of connectivity for imitative and spatial compatibilities, and it is successful in simulating the results from three different S-R tasks. Variations of the model with identical connections for mediating the two compatibilities reveal a significantly poorer fit.

Computational models have provided insights into the developmental changes seen in different cognitive phenomena, including within the domain of word learning. The present paper uses a computational model to investigate the interdependencies between the emergence of different word learning biases. This model allows investigation of how the emergence of the shape bias influences novel noun generalization to two other types of items. The results suggest that the emerging shape bias for solids can either strengthen or weaken other types of biases depending on the strength of the cues to solidity or non-solidity; further, these results make predictions about children’s biased word learning over time.",>Savannah Schilling>Clare Sims>Eliana Colunga,>University of Colorado Boulder>University of Colorado Boulder>University of Colorado Boulder,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0399/index.html
2012,Interactions between abstract actions and apparent distance,"Perceptions influence the way we act in our environment based upon judgments assessing required efforts to perform an action and the availability and demand for immediate action on an object (Proffitt, 2006B). Social and physical anxiety has been shown to distort perceptions of depth and perceptions of object size (Stefanucci et al., 2008; Cañal- Bruland et al., 2010). Relatively little work, however, has explored the potential role of depth perception in abstract reasoning tasks (Landy & Linkenauger, 2010). In Experiment 1, the relationship between depth perception and the order of actions taken to simplify arithmetic expressions was investigated by manipulating apparent distances of arithmetic operations of high and low syntactic precedence. When the high precedence operations appeared to be closer to the participant, expressions were solved more quickly than when low precedence expressions appeared to be closer. Experiment 2 explored the whether the affordance of abstract actions conversely impacted perceived distance by asking participants to make distance judgments to multiplication and addition operations. Experiment 2 found no impact of anxiety about mathematics on perceived distance. However, effects resulting from condition assignment were found to influence perceived distances, as well as solving strategy. We interpret results in terms of attention, which we speculate plays a key role moderating both ordering behavior and perceived distance.",>Kathryn Sears>Jessica Lesky>David Landy,>University of Richmond>University of Richmond>University of Richmond,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0400/index.html

It is often anecdotally reported that time experienced in return travel (back to the start point) seems shorter than time spent in outward travel (travel to a new destination). Here, we report the first experimental results showing that return travel time is experienced as shorter than the actual time because of perceiving vection. Secondary, we explore how numbers are represented in depth in our mental space, we asked participants to sequentially speak random numbers while they observed forward/backward vection. We found that participants tended to generate larger numbers when they perceived backward self-motion. Finally, We found that all the measures of vection correlated negatively with the degree of narcissistic traits of participants.",>Takeharu Seno>Shuichiro Taya>Yuki Yamada>Keiko Ihaya>Hiroyuki Ito>Shoji Sunaga,>Kyushu University>Queen Mary Collage>Kyushu University>Kyushu University>Kyushu University>Kyushu University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0401/index.html
2012,Conscious and unconscious thought preceding complex decisions: The influence of taking notes and intelligence.,"For many years, research has been done to find the best way to make decisions. Dijksterhuis and Nordgren (2006) formulated the Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT), stating that when making complex decisions it is better not to think consciously, but to direct your attention elsewhere, letting the unconscious make the decision. However, a wealth of research has found evidence against the predictions of UTT. Thorsteinson and Withrow (2009) found that participants, who were allowed to take notes during the information intake stage, made better decisions thinking consciously. The current study is a replication of Thorsteinson and Withrow (2009), being a four conditions design (immediate decision, unconscious thought, conscious thought or conscious thought with notes) with the addition of intelligence as a variable. The conclusion of Thorsteinson and Withrow (2009) is supported: The best complex decisions are made when participants take notes and use them while thinking consciously. Moreover, it is shown that intelligence is positively correlated with better decisions.",>Aline Sevenants>Dieter Daniëls>Leen Janssens>Walter Schaeken,>KU Leuven>KU Leuven>KU Leuven>KU Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0402/index.html

2012,Creative Process of Improvised Street Dance,"This paper presents findings from our empirical study of the creative process of improvisation, which has rarely been the subject of research in cognitive science. In this study, battle scenes in street dance were selected as an example of improvised performances. We conducted an experiment to investigate real-time cognitive processes. The results indicated three features: 1) Dancers mainly used well-practiced patterns, and discovered new patterns of dance; 2) In the process of discovering new patterns, dancers often utilized errors in their performance; 3) The processes of discovery were different in the performance of one dancer (solo scene) and the performance of two dancers (battle scene). In solo performance, dancers discovered new patterns by concentrating on their patterned dance. In battle performance, dancers discovered new patterns by utilizing stimuli from the situation (e.g. the music, their opponent) and using errors as an opportunity to loosen the constraints of their well-practiced patterns.",>Daichi Shimizu>Takeshi Okada,>University of Tokyo>University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0404/index.html

We extend a constructive neural-learning algorithm, sibling-descendant cascade-correlation, to monitor lack of progress in learning in order to autonomously abandon unproductive learning. The extended algorithm simulates results of recent experiments with infants who abandon learning on difficult tasks. It also avoids network overtraining effects in a more realistic manner than conventional use of validation test sets. Some contributions and limitations of constructive neural networks for achieving autonomy in learning are briefly assessed.",>Thomas Shultz>Eric Doty>Frederic Dandurand,>McGill University>McGill University>University of Montreal,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0405/index.html

Participants listened to one of two 90-sec excerpts of thematic music (Baby theme or War theme) either before or after engaging in a story generation task. Their stories were examined to determine the degree to which the thematic elements of the music were included in the stories. Across two experiments, there was evidence that listening to war or baby themed music before engaging in a generation task increased the likelihood that elements associated with that theme would be incorporated into the story. Evidence also existed that the music theme interacted with the story theme to influence the degree that thematic elements would be incorporated into the story.",>Cynthia Sifonis>William Fuss,>Oakland U.>Oakland U.,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0406/index.html

We tested three different conditions: visual guidance, instructional guidance, and no guidance. The results show that especially visual guidance was perceived as being helpful for making references between narration and display of an animation. However, students without guidance outperformed both groups of students with guidance on a domain-specific knowledge test. A significant interaction between type of guidance and working memory capacity revealed that visual guidance impeded learning in students with high working memory capacity, whereas instructional guidance impeded learning in students with low working memory capacity. Our results suggest that working memory capacity is an important learner variable that should be taken into account to understand intervention effects and to customize learning environments to learners’ needs.",>Irene Therese Skuballa>Rolf Schwonke>Alexander Renkl,">University of Freiburg, Germany>University of Freiburg, Germany>University of Freiburg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0408/index.html
2012,The inductive potential of religion categories in Northern Ireland,"People often behave as if category members share an essence, and essentialising a category in this way promotes inductive inference. Although natural kind categories have been predominantly studied, some social categories are essentialised and here we consider the inductive potential of religion categories for children in Northern Ireland. We asked seven-, nine- and eleven-year olds in Catholic-maintained, State-controlled and Integrated schools to decide whether pairs of children shared a property. We manipulated the degree of shared membership in religion, gender and musical categories. Overall, religion was much more inductively potent than gender, although older children and children from the Catholic-maintained school were more likely to use additional information about other categories when evaluating inferences. These results suggest that religion categories are a powerful basis for inference even in children as young as seven-years, and that religion categories may be essentialised in Northern Ireland.",>Kirsty Smyth>Conor Pendergrast>Aidan Feeney>Coley John>Cole Edison>Ulrike Niens,>Queen's University Belfast>Queen's University Belfast>Queen's University Belfast>Northeastern University>Northeastern University>Queen's University Belfast,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0409/index.html
2012,Does number interference occur during sentence processing?,"Models of interference in sentence processing claim that object relative clauses are harder to process than subject relatives due to interference between the subject and object noun phrase. The interference effect for object relatives at the verb should be more pronounced when the two noun phrases retrieved from memory are similar. To test this, two eye tracking experiments manipulated whether the number feature of the noun phrases (singular or plural) was either the same or different. Both experiments showed the well-known relative clause effect. However, in Experiment 1 the effect of number congruency was in the opposite direction from that predicted by interference. Experiment 2 showed the interaction predicted by similarity based interference at sentence wrap-up, but because this interaction was observed later than the relative clause effect and only occurred in Experiment 2, it suggests that retrieval interference due to cue overlap is a weak effect that might be the result of a checking procedure in syntactically complex sentences.",>Katja Suckow>Roger P.

Participants read the spatial text and answered true/false questions about it. In Experiment 1, we transposed sentences in a spatial text, and in Experiment 2, we inserted irrelevant tasks into a spatial text. The results showed that performance in a route perspective decreases when text has lost its continuity. This decrease in performance was not found in a survey perspective.

First, we tested whether the role of distributional knowledge concerning stress changes with the development of the reading system; second, we tested whether stress information is computed independently of phonemic information since the first stages of reading acquisition. We ran two identical experiments in Italian, one with children of two age levels (second and fourth grades) and one with adults. Results showed that older children behave similarly to adults, but younger children do not. Differently from the advanced readers, younger children use more general distributional knowledge about stress and are not able to compute stress information apart from phonemes. Taken together, our results suggest that the stress subsystem, and in particular the mechanisms working at the level of the phonological buffer are not fully developed during the first stages of reading.",>Simone Sulpizio>Simone Sulpizio>Magali Boureux>Cristina Burani>Chizuru Deguchi>Lucia Colombo,">Fondazione De Vincenzi ONLUS>Department of Cognitive Science and Education, University of Trento>Department of Philosophy, Pedagogy and Psychology, University of Verona>Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies>Department of Cognitive Science and Education, University of Trento>Department of General Psychology, University of Padua",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0412/index.html
2012,Doppel Teleoperation System: Isolation of physical traits and intelligence for personality study,"We introduce the ``Doppel teleoperation system'', which isolates several physical traits from a speaker, to investigate how personal information is conveyed to other people during conversation. With the Doppel system, one can choose for each of the communication channels to be transferred whether in its original form or in the one generated by the system. For example, the voice and body motion can be replaced by the Doppel system while the speech content is preserved. This will allow us to analyze individual effects of physical traits of the speaker and content in the speaker's speech on identification of personality. This selectivity of personal traits provides us with useful approach to investigate which information conveys our personality through conversation. To show a potential of this proposed system, we conduct an experiment to test how much the content of conversation conveys the personality of speakers to interlocutors, without any physical traits of the speakers. Preliminary results show that although interlocutors have difficulty identifying their speakers only by using conversational contents, they can recognize their acquaintances when their acquaintances are the speakers.

Two studies were conducted to assess this phenomenon: Study 1 (interpretation-production) and Study 2 (interpretation-presentation study). In Study 1, we observed that a greater number of interpretations were produced from a metaphor that was interesting and easy to understand as compared to one that was less interesting and difficult to understand. In Study 2, we observed that a metaphor was more interesting when more information on simile interpretation was presented.

Among some psychological factors, only importance was related to intended transmission of rumor. Surprisingly, accuracy and anxiety were not predictors of any transmission.

An experiment examines the hypothesis that new features emerge as metaphoric interpretations through association with non-emergent features connected with the topic, vehicle, or both. In the experiment, participants were presented with a non-emergent feature as a prime, a metaphor, and an emergent feature, sequentially. Participants were then asked to respond as to whether the emergent feature is an appropriate interpretation of the metaphor. The results showed that primed non-emergent features derived from the vehicle facilitate the recognition of emergent features. The results support an account in which new features emerge through two processes -- non-emergent features are recognized as interpretations of the metaphor and then these non-emergent features facilitate the recognition of emergent features.",>Asuka Terai>Robert Goldstone,>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0417/index.html
2012,An fMRI Investigation of Feature-Emergence-related Activation within Metaphor Comprehension,"Metaphor comprehension involves the generation of novel semantic attributes, especially when a metaphor emphasizes a shared but atypical characteristic of the relevant concepts. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explores neural activation during the process of attribute generation known as feature emergence. The participants judged whether a presented semantic feature was an appropriate interpretation of a primed metaphor sentence. Two types of features were evaluated: emergent features that are not applicable to the respective concepts and only become salient in a metaphorical context and non-emergent features which are typical characteristics.

2012,Explanation Reconstruction through Reinterpretation of Key Facts,"Reconstructing explanations is crucial for the progress of science. We focused on the transition of interest in a key fact that contradicts the preceding explanation and has a central role in its reconstruction. We used a short story as an experimental material in which the participants first constructed a naïve explanation and reconstructed it. First, when the naïve explanation was rejected, a new explanation was required, after interest in the key fact was inhibited. Second, hypothesized premises not inconsistent with the naïve explanation were sought to protect the naïve explanation. Third, interest in the key fact was recovered through the process of the explanation reconstruction. Last, we facilitated the explanation reconstruction by having the participants focus on the key fact.",>Hitoshi Terai>Kazuhisa Miwa>Shota Matsubayashi,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0419/index.html
2012,Automatic Detection of Metonymies using Associative Relations between Words,"It is crucial for computers to detect metonymic expressions because sentences including them may have different meanings from literal ones. In previous studies, detecting metonymies has been done mainly by rule-based and statistical approaches. The problem of current metonymy detection is that using syntactic and semantic information may be not enough to detect metonymic expressions. In this study, we propose an approach for detecting them with associative information between words. We evaluated our method by comparing it with a baseline that uses syntactic and semantic information. As a result, our method showed significantly better accuracy (0.84) of judging words as metonymic or literal expressions than that of the baseline.",>Takehiro Teraoka>Ryuichiro Higashinaka>Jun Okamoto>Shun Ishizaki,">Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University>NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, NTT Corporation>Department of Business Innovation, Kaetsu University>Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0420/index.html
2012,Flexible sequence learning in a SOM model of the mirror system,"We present initial work on a biologically and cognitively inspired model that may allow embodied agents to autonomously learn sequences of action primitives (forming an overall behaviour). Specifically, we combine a flexible model of sequence generation with a model of parietal mirror neuron activity. The main purpose is to illustrate that the approach is viable. Although further work is needed to improve the results sketched out here, the concept is sound and relevant both to efforts in modelling mirror neuron activity and enabling artificial embodied agents to autonomously learn sequences of action primitives.",>Serge Thill>Josef Behr>Tom Ziemke,>University of Skovde>University of Osnabruck>University of Skovde,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0421/index.html
2012,Fuzzy Memory Theory and its Use in Cognitive Science,"Fuzzy memory theory extends fuzzy set theory to the case of imperfectly performing memory devices. In fuzzy set theory, the key concept is that of graded set membership. The degree to which an item belongs to a set is specified by a continuous function. Fuzzy memory theory is organized around the analogous concept of *graded recall*. Items stored in a fuzzy memory are associated with cues, such that each item is recalled by provision of the corresponding cue. But unlike conventional memory (where cues are typically addresses) the recall process may vary in its degree of error. The item produced may embody missing information. The capacity of a fuzzy memory is then measured in terms of the net information content of recalled items. The theory has potential applications for new forms of technology, but also for the study of cognition. In particular, it can be the means of formalizing the properties of error-prone natural memory mechanisms. It can also supply a non-circular explanation for similarity-based category formation.",>Chris Thornton,>University of Sussex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0422/index.html
2012,From Head to Toe: Embodiment Through Statistical Linguistic Frequencies,"Recent literature in the cognitive sciences has demonstrated that cognition is fundamentally embodied. For instance, various studies have shown that semantic knowledge about the human body correlates with spatial body representations, suggesting that such knowledge is embodied in nature. An alternative explanation for this finding comes from the Symbol Interdependency Hypothesis, which argues that perceptual information is encoded in language. We demonstrated that the findings that can be explained by an embodied cognition account can also be explained through statistical linguistic frequencies. Co-occurrence frequencies of names for common body parts correlated with experimental findings from adults and children. Moreover, the position of the body parts was predicted on the basis of statistical linguistic frequencies. These findings suggest that language encodes embodied information.",>Richard Tillman>Vivek Datla>Sterling Hutchinson>Max Louwerse,">University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA>University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA>University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA>University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0423/index.html
2012,Evidence for Modality-Specific Processes in Approximate Numerical Comparison,"It has been claimed that a genuinely abstract number representation exists and is capable of representing the numerosity of any set of discrete elements irrespective of whether they are presented in visual or auditory modality. To test whether adults can compare large numerosities cross-modally as accurately as intra-modally, we measured Weber fractions and a point of subjective equality of numerical discrimination in the visual, auditory, and cross-modal conditions with use of a carefully controlled experimental procedure. Results showed distinct differences between the performances of the visual and the auditory condition in such way that numerical discrimination of the auditory sequence is more precise than that of visual sequence. Moreover, the performance of cross-modal trials differed among participants, with the exception that they were all worse than the auditory condition and that the number of visual stimuli was overestimated. Taken together, our findings implied that numerical discrimination of the auditory and visual stimuli mediates the modality-specific processes, suggesting that the numerical representation process can be complex of multiple stages.",>Midori Tokita>Akira Ishiguchi,>Ochanomizu University>Ochanomizu University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0424/index.html
2012,Embodied Communication Practices in Instructive Interaction between Musicians,"Musicians, in the discussion and teaching of their art, commonly make use of vocalizations in order to demonstrate a particular melody or musical phrase. In the present study, we consider the use of these vocalizations as part of embodied depictions, and the role that these embodied communication practices play in music instruction. Data drawn from video recordings of private lessons between a clarinetist and his instructor demonstrate that these enactments are used in order to (re-) represent the experience of both performing and listening. The music instructor makes use of these embodied depictions for a number of actions central to teaching the art, including assessment, direction, and displays of understanding. In considering body-based communicative practices as an instructive tool, we consider both simulation and social action based cognitive perspectives through application in the analysis of goal-oriented interaction.",>Jackson Tolins,">University of Colorado, Boulder, Boulder, Colorado, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0425/index.html
2012,Viewing and performing actions can change what you see,"Previous research has demonstrated a tight link between object perception and action: viewing an object primes the action needed to interact with it, while priming an action can affect the speed and accuracy with which we perceive the object. However, it is not yet known whether motor information can qualitatively change what object we actually perceive. We investigated this issue by having participants view or perform an action before viewing an ambiguous object. Results showed that viewing an action (a picture of a hand displaying a power or precision grasp) biased participants to interpret the ambiguous object as congruent with the action prime (Experiments 1 and 2). Conversely, performing an action (moving small or large balls from one tray to another) biased participants to interpret the object as incongruent with the motor action. Together, these results suggest viewing and performing actions can actually change what we see.",>Alexia Toskos Dils>Stephen Flusberg>Lera Boroditsky,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0426/index.html

Results in the present study extends the Boundary Shift Hypothesis, suggesting that the linguistic boundary between individuals and nonindividuals influences the perceptual boundaries and the correlational patterns formed overtime between ontological kinds. The results provide a new perspective on the facilitative role of linguistic markers in category formations, rather than strictly in boundary formations. This demonstrates the potential degree of cognitive processing among different language learners and lends support towards a mechanistic explanation of the role of language in categorical formations.",>Duc Tran>Hanako Yoshida,>University of Houston>University of Houston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0427/index.html
2012,Writing facilitates learning to read in Chinese through reduction of holistic processing: A developmental study,"Holistic processing has been identified as an expertise marker of face and object recognition. In contrast, the expertise marker of recognizing Chinese characters is reduced holistic processing (Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009), which is driven by Chinese writing experiences rather than reading ability (Tso, Au, & Hsiao, 2011). Here we investigate the developmental trend of holistic processing in Chinese character recognition and its relationship with literacy by testing children who were learning Chinese at a public elementary school in Hong Kong. We found that the holistic processing effect of Chinese characters in children was reduced as they reached higher grades; this reduction was driven by enhanced Chinese literacy rather than age. In addition, we found that writing predicts reading performance through reduced holistic processing as a mediator. We thus argue that writing hones analytic processing, which is essential for Chinese character recognition, and in turn facilitates learning to read in Chinese.",>Ricky Van Yip Tso>Terry Kit-fong Au>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao,>University of Hong Kong>University of Hong Kong>University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0428/index.html
2012,Temporal Dynamics of Action Perception: The Role of Biological Appearance and Motion Kinematics,"We studied action perception and the role of visual form and visual motion kinematics of the observed agent using a stimulus set of human and humanoid robot actions and electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants viewed 2s. videos of three agents (Human, Android, Robot) performing recognizable actions: Human had biological form and motion, Android had biological form and non-biological motion, and Robot had non-biological form and non-biological motion. Early in processing (P200), Robot was distinguished from the other agents, likely due to low-level visual properties of the stimuli. We found a right temporal N170, which was most pronounced for Human, indicating possible modulation of this face- and body-sensitive ERP component by biological motion. There was a centro-parietal negativity (N300) that was most pronounced for Robot, and a later one (N400) for Human and Android. In the same time period (N300), Android was distinguished in the frontal channels from the other agents. A late positivity (P600) distinguished Human, again in frontal channels. These results highlight differential spatiotemporal cortical patterns during action perception depending on the viewed agent’s form and motion kinematics.",>Burcu Aysen Urgen>Markus Plank>Hiroshi Ishiguro>Howard Poizner>Ayse Pinar Saygin,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>Osaka University>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0429/index.html
2012,Effects of Discourse Goals on the Process of Metaphor Production,"Only a few attempts have so far been made at exploring the process of metaphor production, although a large number of studies have addressed metaphor comprehension. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of how people generate metaphors or identify an apt vehicle for a given topic of metaphors. Specifically, we examine how the process and product of metaphor production differ between two discourse goals of metaphor, namely an explanatory purpose (e.g., to clarify) and a literary purpose (e.g., to aesthetically pleasing). Experiment 1 analysed the metaphors (or vehicles) generated in the metaphor production task, and demonstrated that people identified more prototypical exemplars of the property attributed to the topic as a vehicle for explanatory metaphors than for literary metaphors. In addition, it was found that explanatory metaphors were more apt and conventional, and had high topic-vehicle similarity than literary metaphors, while literary metaphors were more familiar and imageable than explanatory metaphors. Experiment 2 used a priming paradigm to assess the online availability of prototypical and less prototypical members of the topic property during metaphor production. The result was that both prototypical and less prototypical members were activated in producing literary metaphors, while neither members were activated in the production of explanatory metaphors. These findings indicate that the process of metaphor production is affected by discourse goals of metaphor, and suggest that only prototypical members of the category are rapidly searched for a vehicle during the production of explanatory metaphors, while both prototypical and less prototypical members are searched to generate literary metaphors.",>Akira Utsumi>Kota Nakamura>Maki Sakamoto,>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0430/index.html
2012,Modeling Efficient Serial Visual Search,"Humans perform visual search fairly efficiently, finding targets within only a few fixations. Data from eye-tracked participants was subjected to a fixation by fixation analysis to pinpoint why participants tended to make fewer fixations than would be expected by chance. The goal of this paper is to present a computational model that performs visual search as efficiently as humans. The model varied several components that may have aided visual search: memory, search strategy, and degree of parafoveal vision. Two dependent measures were used to evaluate the model: number of fixations to find the target and the distribution of saccade amplitudes. The best fitting model suggested that the biggest contribution to efficient search came from larger parafoveal vision. Search strategy, however, accounted for the distribution of saccade amplitudes.",>Bella Veksler>Wayne Gray,">Air Force Research Laboratory>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0431/index.html
2012,A Conceptual Network-Based Approach to Inferring the Cultural Evolutionary History of the Baltic Psaltery,"The application of conventional phylogenetic techniques for inferring cultural history is problematic due to differences in the nature of information transmission in biological and cultural realms. In culture, units of transmission are not just measurable attributes, but communicable concepts. Therefore, relatedness amongst cultural elements often resides at the conceptual level not captured by traditional phylogenetic methods. This paper takes a cognitively inspired approach to analyzing material cultural history. We show that combining data for physical attributes of cultural artifacts with conceptual information can uncover cultural influences among different ethnolinguistic groups, and reveal new patterns of cultural ancestry. Using the Baltic psaltery, a musical instrument with a well-documented ethnographic and archaeological record, we recovered a previously unacknowledged pattern of historical relationship that is more congruent with geographical distribution and temporal data than is obtained with other approaches.",>Tomas Veloz>Ilya Tëmkin>Liane  Gabora,>University of British Columbia>Northern Virginia Community College National Museum of Natural History>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0432/index.html
2012,Factors influencing children's display of surprise,"Earlier studies found a discrepancy between the display and feeling of surprise. Therefore, we assessed what factors influence the display of surprise in children of two age groups: 8- and 11-year-olds. We manipulated the social setting (children either competed or collaborated), and the cause of surprise (a surprisingly positive or negative event). We found that children used more features to express negatively caused surprise, compared to positively caused surprise and that 11-year-olds used more facial features than 8-year-olds. In a subsequent perception study, adults judged video clips with surprised and neutral reactions, for the degree of surprise that was displayed. We found higher ratings of surprise for negatively vs. positively surprised children, competing vs. collaborating children, and 11-year-olds vs. 8-year-olds. These results confirm that in addition to the feeling of surprise, its cause, the social setting, and age also affect the display of surprise.",>Mandy Visser>Emiel Krahmer>Marc Swerts,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0433/index.html
2012,Estimating Semantic Transparency of Constituents of English Compounds and Two-Character Chinese Words using Latent Semantic Analysis,"The constituents of English compounds (e.g., butter and fly for butterfly) and two-character Chinese words may differ in meaning from the whole word. Furthermore, the meanings of the words containing the same constituent (e.g., butter in “butterfingers”, or “buttermilk”) may or may not be consistent. Estimating semantic transparency of a constituent is usually difficult and subjective because of these uncertainties and ambiguities. It is rather unexplored why a constituent is considered transparent/opaque by raters, and how its polysemy correlates to its transparency. We propose a computational method for predicting semantic transparency based on Latent Semantic Analysis. We computed the primary meaning of a constituent by a clustering analysis and compared it to the whole-word meaning. The proposed method successfully predicted participants’ transparency ratings, and may explain the cognitive processes in raters when classifying semantic transparency of English compounds and two-character Chinese words.",>Hsueh-Cheng Wang>Li-Chuan Hsu>Yi-Min Tien>Marc Pomplun,">Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston>Graduate Institute of Neural and Cognitive Sciences, Taiwan>Department of Psychology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taiwan>Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0434/index.html
2012,Visual Attention is Attracted by Text Features Even in Scenes without Text,"Previous studies have found that viewers’ attention is disproportionately attracted by texts, and one possible reason is that viewers have developed a “text detector” in their visual system to bias their attention toward text features. To verify this hypothesis, we add a text detector module to a visual attention model and test if the inclusion increases the model’s ability to predict eye fixation positions, particularly in scenes without any text. A model including text detector, saliency, and center bias is found to predict viewers’ eye fixations better than the same model without text detector, even in text-absent images. Furthermore, adding the text detector – which was designed for English texts – improves the prediction of both English- and Chinese-speaking viewers’ attention but with a stronger effect for English-speaking viewers. These results support the conclusion that, due to the viewers’ everyday reading training, their attention in natural scenes is biased toward text features.",>Hsueh-Cheng Wang>Shijian Lu>Joo-Hwee Lim>Marc Pomplun,">Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston>Department of Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore>Department of Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore>Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0435/index.html
2012,Implicit theories of the causes of weight gain in adults,"This study sought to explore the range of beliefs about weight gain and whether these beliefs varied according to personal weight management history. A questionnaire specifically designed for the study was completed by 376 participants (94 males, 282 females; mean age 43.65 years, SD=13.24). Principal component analysis identified five causal attribution factors which were interpreted as Lack-of-Self-Control, Lifestyle-Limitations, Psychological, Biological/Medical, and Modern-Living. The level of endorsement for these causal attribution factors suggested an acknowledgement of the multiple causes to weight gain. However, the most highly endorsed factor, Lack-of-Self Control, reflected the “commonsense” view of weight gain being a matter of overeating, under-exercising and lacking in self control. Personal weight management history was found to be associated with variations in beliefs with the more effort one had applied to weight management; the more highly they endorsed causes both within and outside of individual control.",>Nicole Ware>Rachel Dryer,>Charles Sturt University>Charles Sturt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0436/index.html
2012,Relationship between Phonemes and Tactile-emotional Evaluations in Japanese Sound Symbolic Words,"Many languages have a word class whose speech sounds are linked to sensory experiences (sound symbolism). Here we investigated sound symbolism in touch. Specifically, we performed psychophysical experiments to study the relationship between phonemes of Japanese sound symbolic words and emotional evaluations of objects in contact. Participants expressed the sensation obtained from touched materials using Japanese sound symbolic words and evaluated the comfort of tactile sensation. Our results show the existence of unique associations between the phonemes of the words for expressing the sensation and the evaluations of comfort in touch. Next, we compared the results with those for a condition in which the evaluations of comfort on tactile materials were made without expressing the sensations. We found that when certain phonemes are used for expressing the sensation, the evaluations can be biased.",>Junji Watanabe>Yuuka Utsunomiya>Hiroya Tsukurimichi>Maki Sakamoto,">NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation>Department of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications>Department of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications>Department of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0437/index.html
2012,Actor-Observer Asymmetries in Judgments of Intentional Actions,"Much recent empirical research has explored the influence of moral evaluations on judgments about the intentionality of foreseeable side-effects of actions. Research on this ‘Side-Effect effect’ (also called the ‘Knobe effect’) has relied almost exclusively on vignette-based surveys, which have serious limitations when used in isolation. We present a novel behavioral methodology that tests the Side-Effect effect in two previously unexamined contexts: (i) judgments of real (rather than hypothetical) actions, and (ii) judgments about one’s own actions. The results suggest that judgments about one’s own actions tend to show a reverse Side-Effect effect: actors judge that (real) positive side-effects of their own actions are intentional whereas negative ones are not. The use of non-hypothetical situations also appears to attenuate the standard Side-Effect effect, which raises interesting challenges for standard theoretical accounts. These results provide preliminary evidence that the Side-Effect effect is driven by the same mechanisms underlying other asymmetries in causal attribution.",>Sarah Wellen>David Danks,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0438/index.html
2012,Learning Causal Structure through Local Prediction-error Learning,"Research on human causal learning has largely focused on strength learning, or on computational-level theories; there are few formal algorithmic models of how people learn causal structure from covariations. We introduce a model that learns causal structure in a local manner via prediction-error learning. This local learning is then integrated dynamically into a unified representation of causal structure. The model uses computationally plausible approximations of (locally) rational learning, and so represents a hybrid between the associationist and rational paradigms in causal learning research.

2012,Reading direction is sufficient to account for the optimal viewing position in reading: The case of music reading,"The Optimal viewing position (OVP), the position where word recognition is the best, is biased to the left for English words. Several explanations have been proposed to account for this phenomenon, including the left hemispheric dominance for language, asymmetric information structure of words, and reading direction. However, it is unclear which factor(s) is necessary or sufficient to cause an asymmetric OVP. Using music reading, which shares only the reading direction but not the other two factors with word reading, we show that the OVP for three-note sequences is significantly biased to the left only for expert readers but not for novices. The degree of asymmetry in the OVP curve for music readers increases with individual reading skill, suggesting that their OVP is gradually shifted to the left during the development of reading skills. These suggest that habitual reading direction is sufficient to account for a biased OVP to the left.",>Yetta Kwailing Wong>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao,>University of Hong Kong>University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0441/index.html

2012,Inference and culture : The distinction between low context culture and high context culture as a possible explanation for cultural differences in cognition,"Nisbett et al. (2001) claim that Easterners are more likely to use holistic thinking to solve problems, whereas Westerners are more likely to use analytic thinking. This distinction in cognitive behaviors has often been explained by using a framework based on the fact that Western culture favors independent self-construal (individualist culture) and Eastern culture favors interdependent self-construal (collectivist culture). However, we propose another possible cultural explanation in the distinction between Western low context culture and Eastern high context culture (Hall, 1976). We particularly focus on the difference between the rule-based inference more common in low-context Western cultures and the dialectical inference more common in high-context Eastern cultures, and we argue that rule-based inference using global rules is more adaptive in low context cultures.",>Hiroshi Yama>Norhayati Zakaria,>Osaka City University>University of Wollongong Dubai,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0443/index.html
2012,“What” versus “How” in Nonvisual Whole-Body Movement,"Dissociable processes for conscious perception (“what” processing) and guidance of action (“how” processing) have been identified in visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems. The present study was designed to find similar dissociation within whole-body movements in which the presence of vestibular information creates a unique perceptual condition. In two experiments, blindfolded participants walked along a linear path and specified the walked distance by verbally estimating it (“what” measure) and by pulling a length of tape that matched the walked distance (“how” measure). Although these two measures yielded largely comparable responses under a normal walking condition, variability in verbal estimates showed a qualitatively different pattern from that in tape-pulling when sensory input into walking was altered by having participants wear a heavy backpack. This suggests that the “what” versus “how” dissociation exists in whole-body movements as well, supporting a claim that it is a general principle with which perceptual systems are organized.",>Naohide Yamamoto>Dale A.

2012,The Influence of Risk Aversion on Visual Decision Making,"The ability to decide between multiple fixation targets in complex visual environments is essential for our survival. Evolution has refined this process to be both rapid and cheap, allowing us to perform over 100,000 saccades a day. Previous models for visual decision making have focused on maximizing reward magnitude or expected value (EV = probability of reward × magnitude of reward). However, such methods fail to incorporate utility, or happiness derived from reward, optimizing strictly on nominal reward values. We propose an alternative model for visual decision making, maximizing utility as opposed to value under the assumption of a decreasing marginal utility curve. To test our model, we asked 10 UCSD graduate students to participate in an eyetracking experiment where they choose between different fixation targets presented on a brief display. The reward for each target was generated from fixed, predetermined distributions with different variance that was initially unknown to the subjects. The subjects were asked to maximize their reward for each test session within the experiment. Comparing our results with expected value and reward optimizing hedge algorithms, we show that utility-based models more accurately reflect human behavior in visual decision making tasks.",>Ruixin Yang>Garrison Cottrell,>University of California San Diego>University of California San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0445/index.html

However, the exact circumstances under which focal attention might ‘split’ have not been well understood. The present study is the first in the literature to examine the possibility that ecological differences arising from our increasingly media-saturated environment may result in individual differences in the capacity to demonstrate splitting focal attention. Results suggest a significant relationship between the behavioural preference for consuming multiple media forms simultaneously and the capacity to employ a split mode of attention.",>Jit Yong Yap>Stephen Wee Hun Lim,>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0446/index.html
2012,Roles of Adult’s Gestures and Eye Gaze in Whole or Object Part Presenting,"We investigated the use of a caregiver’s actions and eye-gaze in teaching whole or part names. The experimental material consisted of two everyday objects, a toothbrush (the whole name was “haburashi”, the part name was “ke”) and a ball-point pen. We coded 4 action type categories and 2 eye gaze type categories based on the video data of 19 4-year-old child-mother dyads using frame-by-frame method. Results of actions showed that when the caregiver uttered a whole object name such as toothbrush (“haburashi”), the caregiver tended to present the object to the child by showing it. When she uttered a part name to teach the part name such as brush (“ke”), she pointed at the object part. Results of eye gaze analysis showed whereas the caregiver tended to look at the child’s face in teaching whole names, she tended to look at the object in teaching part names. We found that caregivers use different gestures and eye gaze directions to teach whole or object part names.

2012,State-Trace Analysis of Sequence Learning by Simple Recurrent Networks,"This study investigated the use of state-trace analysis (Bamber, 1979) when applied to computational models of human learning. We aimed to investigate the performance of simple recurrent networks (SRNs) on a sequence learning task. Elman’s (1990) SRN and Cleeremans & McClelland’s (1991) Augmented SRN are both benchmark models of human sequence learning. The differences between these models, comprising of an additional learning parameter and the use of response units activated by output units constituted our main manipulation. The results are presented as a state-trace analysis, which demonstrates that the addition of an additional type of weight component and response units to a SRN produces multi-dimensional state-trace plots. Varying the learning rate parameter of the SRN also produced two functions on a state-trace plot, suggesting that state-trace analysis may also be sensitive to variation within a single process.",>Fayme Yeates>Fergal Jones>Andy Wills>Ian P.

2012,The Role of Attention in Three-way binding in Episodic Memory,"The current study examines the role of attention in forming complex binding structures in episodic memory. Previous research (Yim, Dennis, & Sloutsky, 2011a, 2011b) indicated that three-way bindings can be formed within an explicit memory task. Here we attempt to reduce explicit attending by presenting participants with a variant of statistical learning. The paradigm was modified to accommodate the constraints in two list learning paradigms ABABr, and ABCD. Only the ABABr paradigm requires a three-way binding in order to perform above chance. Evidence of learning was derived from learning curves, accuracies and reaction time at test. Results show evidence of learning for the ABCD condition but not for the ABABr condition. This finding indicates that whereas the ABCD structure can be learned implicitly, learning of ABABr lists depends on attention and requires explicit learning.",>Hyungwook Yim>Simon Dennis>Vladimir Sloutsky,">Department of Psychology & Center for Cognitive Science, The Ohio State University>Department of Psychology & Center for Cognitive Science, The Ohio State University>Department of Psychology & Center for Cognitive Science, The Ohio State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0449/index.html
2012,Visual Context Effects on Thematic Role Assignment in Children versus Adults: Evidence from Eye Tracking in German,"Prior research has shown that adults can make rapid use of visual context information (e.g., visual referential contrast and depicted agent-action-patient events) for syntactic structuring and disambiguation. By contrast, little is known about how visual context influences children’s language comprehension, and some results even suggest children cannot use visual referential context for syntactic structuring (e.g., Trueswell et al., 1999). We examined whether children (unlike adults) also struggle to use other kinds of information in visual context (e.g., depicted events) for real-time language comprehension. In two eye-tracking studies we directly compared real-time effects of depicted events on children’s (Exp1) vs. adults’ (Exp2) processing of spoken German subject-verb-object (SVO) and object-verb-subject (OVS) sentences. Both of these word orders are grammatical, but OVS is a non-canonical structure. Five-year olds are at chance in understanding even unambiguous OVS sentences in the absence of visual context (Dittmar et al., 2008). If children can use depicted events rapidly for syntactic structuring, we should find similar visual context effects for them as have been reported for adults (Knoeferle et al., 2005), and similar gaze pattern as for the adults in the present studies. Gaze pattern in the present studies suggested that events depicting who-does-what-to-whom incrementally influenced both adults’ and 5-year-olds’ visual attention and thematic role assignment. Depicted-event information helped children to get rid of their initial preference for the preferred SVO structure when interpreting OVS sentences. However, visual context effects were subtly delayed in children (vs. adults), and varied as a function of their accuracy and cognitive capacity.",>Lu Zhang>Pia Knoeferle,">CITEC, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany>CITEC, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0450/index.html
2012,Argument Homogeneousness and Structure Simplicity,"Subjects and objects are arguments of verbs. They show either homogeneous or heterogeneous properties, with respect to time. The subject of sleep and the subject of fall are homogeneous and heterogeneous, respectively. In this research, we develop a novel analysis of the organization of arguments of various types of verbs. We argue that heterogeneous arguments are hosted in two levels of Verb Phrase, whereas homogeneous ones are hosted in one level of Verb Phrase. Therefore, homogeneous events and states are encoded in simpler syntactic structures than heterogeneous ones in natural language.",>Niina Ning Zhang,>National Chung-Cheng University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0451/index.html
2012,Modeling a Cognitively Limited Network in an Agent-Based Simulation,"We investi¬gate how cognitive capacity limits the number of group relations that a person can maintain. The simulation experiment’s results using ACT-R and its memory equations replicated an effect similar to that of Dunbar’s (1998) number, or the average total number of group ties capable of being supported in memory. In our study, we also examined the influences of two spatial factors (navigation strategies and map configurations) on the growth of genera¬tive networks. Our results suggest three interesting conclu¬sions: (a) a fixed-path navigation strategy increases the speed that networks can form; (b) a higher grid ratio (connectivity of the agents’ world) provides more chances for agents to build relations, and thus increases the network generation speed; but (c) neither factor influenced the total relations that an agent could maintain, which implies that Dunbar’s number primarily depends on internal cognitive factors and less on external factors.",>Changkun Zhao>Ryan Kaulakis>Jonathan Morgan>Jeremiah Hiam>Frank Ritter,">Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania, United States>Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania, United States>Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania, United States>Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania, United States>Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0452/index.html

This is the first paper utilizing deep learning techniques to model human’s attention for face recognition. In our attention model based on bilinear deep belief network (DBDN), the discriminant information is maximized in a frame of simulating the human visual cortex and human’s perception. Comparative experiments demonstrate that from recognition accuracy our deep learning model outperforms both representative benchmark models and existing bio-inspired models.

Participants in the control group were asked to create metaphors immediately after they were given the theme phrase. Participants in the incubation group were asked to generate metaphors after a distracter task. Participants in the wait group were asked to create metaphors after-thinking for three minutes. The results of the experiment revealed that when the theme phrases contained connected but complex words, the incubation group created more metaphors than the other groups.

We applied the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure this attitude in nursing. This study examines the IAT's validity and reliability. In experiment 1, we conducted IAT and a scale of attitude toward safety for medical staff (Kamizono, 2000) for 71 students from a university of nursing. Validity was demonstrated from a difference of the reaction time between the blocks of IAT and a significant correlation between IAT score and the score of scale. Reliability was indicated by dispersion between trials. In experiment 2, we conducted the IAT for 51 medical staffs who serve as risk managers in a hospital.

2012,Frame Augmented Language Model,"N-gram based statistical language model is widely used in NLP applications such as Automated Speech Recognition and Machine Translation due to its ease of use and effectiveness. Given the very simple assumption of this model, the effectiveness of this model is somewhat surprising, but there clearly exist deficiencies such as the inability to account for long-distance dependencies and the lack of considerations for the overall meaning. There have been various approaches to enhance the n-gram language model by incorporating syntactic and semantic elements. In this paper, we explore the use of frames of the Berkeley FrameNet as a way of augmenting the purely statistically driven language model with semantic information; while the conventional n-gram model supplies the overall probability score of the surface form of a sentence, the candidate frames evoked by this sentence provide the means to calculate the conceptual relatedness among the words within the sentence. The two measures are combined via linear interpolation to give an overall score. In addition to boosting the overall performance, we believe that our approach brings the language model a bit closer to the reality of human language processing.",>Kisuh Ahn>Eunsuk Lim,>Hankuk University of Foreign Studies>Hankuk University of Foreign Studies,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0457/index.html
2012,Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis Applied to the Language Switch in the Bilingual Brain--An fMRI Study,"Previous fMRI studies about bilingual speakers proved that the left caudate and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) play the important role in intralanguage task switching (Crinion et al., 2006; Abutalebi et al., 2008). Our research based on Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) suggests that these brain regions are involved in the language control not only, but also in semantic processing which encapsulates a covert translation between the first/second native languages. Using a set of stimuli which was composed of two semantic categories, Korean-Chinese bilinguals were requested to do a property generation task in Korean for a stimulus word in Chinese, vice versa. Machine learning methods applied to the fMRI datasets enabled us to create, even from the aforementioned regions of interest (relatively small with only about 1000 voxels), significant classification models with the identification accuracy of more than 60% (above chance) for predicting the semantic category of each target.",>Hiroyuki Akama>Miao Mei Lei>Na Li>Brian Murphy,>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0458/index.html

The improvement of speech intelligibility by head movement has been reported by Munhall et al. (2003) and the increase in the perceptual rate of a sentential focus with head or facial movement by Krahmer and Swerts (2007). Here, I will show that the syntactic structure can influence visual prosody. With video clips of two Japanese newsreaders from thirty-nine news programs, a perceptual experiment was carried out on untrained twenty-six subjects. They were instructed to judge the timing when the newsreaders made a head nod. It turned out that the speakers had a strong tendency to nod at the matrix verbs. As for the embedded verbs, those in the sentential compliments and in the advervial phrases frequently co-occur with head nods, whereas those in the relative clauses which modify nouns did much less frequently.",>Haruka Amatani,">University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0459/index.html

In an experiment, participants were informed about their tasks that involved causality, and they were randomly assigned to four conditions: medium contingency without ego-involvement, medium contingency with ego-involvement, high contingency without ego-involvement, and high contingency with ego-involvement. Thereafter, they were asked to rate the strength of the causality of two events. The result showed that the effect of ego-involvement was clear only when the contingency was high: when ego-involvement was present, the causal relationship was judged stronger than when it was absent. This is similar to the result of an experiment in which contingency was considered as a within-subject variable. The result confirmed that ego-involvement affects causal reasoning when the contingency is high.",>Yoshiko Arai,>Osaka City University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0460/index.html

However, detailed mechanisms of sound symbolism remain controversial, even in reports of recent studies. This study examines a method to detect sound symbolism using discriminative learning. First, we build a training dataset comprising name pairs: (1) name-A, (2) name-B, and (3) a label showing which has stronger sound symbolism. Next, we train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn data using both character-based features and phoneme-based features. In experiments, the proposed method demonstrated almost identical performance to that of humans (72% agreement ratio to humans). This paper also presents a method to generate new names with strong sound symbolism based on greedy search. The generated names have high agreement to human judgments (84%).

On the other hand, back-propagation models are 3-layered models with a hidden layer. In addition to the hidden layer, attractor networks have a cleanup layer from/to the output layer. We had all the models learnt the data sets of Hinton & Schallice(1991), Plaut & Schallice (1993), and Tyler et al(2000). The components of language processings are divided to three parts, orthography, phonology and semantics. The comparison among the models and the data sets revealed adequacy as a model of dyslectic patients. It also revealed that the cleanup layer had to play an important roll in order to process all the data set.

Using this technique, we have tested 25 groups in jigsaw-like, knowledge-constructive collaborative learning situations, with eighty 5th and 6th graders on science topics. There was one robot for each group, which consisted of 2 to 4 children. We have found that (1) children collaborated well among themselves and (2) they could learn well with such robots.

2012,What do children hear? Japanese parents' use of numeral classifiers,"Previous work on children’s acquisition of Japanese numeral classifiers has provided extensive information regarding classifier acquisition and its effect on cognitive development (e.g., Yamamoto, 2005). However, few studies have examined the considerable variability found in these studies. We propose that variability in children’s classifier acquisition may be due to input. Thus, we examined parent input of Japanese numeral classifiers to Japanese-speaking children. Participants were two- to five-year-old monolingual Japanese and bilingual Japanese-English children and their Japanese-speaking parents. Parents were instructed to “read” a wordless picture book about counting to their children. Book readings were video-recorded and coded for frequency, type, and correctness of parent classifier use. Children also participated in Give-N and counting tasks. We hypothesize that children whose input includes many generic classifiers (e.g., -ko: generic classifier for inanimate objects) will have more advanced number understanding than children whose input includes more specific classifiers (e.g., -ken: classifier for houses).",>Natsuki Atagi>Catherine Sandhofer,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0465/index.html
2012,Comparison and contrast in novel objects categorization: the role of executive functions,"We investigated how 4- and 6-year-olds use within and between category comparisons when they generalize novel names for novel objects on a nonsalient dimension such as texture (rather than shape). Children first learned a novel name for one or several stimulus. In the generalization phase we pitted a texture match against a shape match and we manipulated the quantity of information (positive or negative evidence). We manipulated number of standards, presence of contrast and age. Our results confirm the role of within category comparisons in texture choices. Further, older children performed significantly better than younger children only when there were four standards. Hence, increasing the load of comparison does not hinder but may be of more help for older than for younger children. We also found a beneficial effect of between category comparisons for both age groups. This is compatible with the role of executive functions in comparisons.",>Luc Augier>Jean-Pierre Thibaut,>University of Burgundy>University of Burgundy,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0466/index.html
2012,Comparison of the brain regions activated during comprehension of action sentences referring to unimanual or bimanual actions: An fMRI study,"Within the framework of embodied cognition, sentences are thought to be comprehended by mental simulations in the sensorimotor system. Several fMRI studies have shown that motor regions are activated during action-sentence comprehension tasks. In this fMRI study, we examined whether all body movements are mentally simulated during these tasks. We assigned action-sentence comprehension tasks to 18 participants for identifying brain regions that are activated while reading sentences referring to unimanual or bimanual actions. When the participants read the bimanual action sentences, left SPL (Brodmann Area 7), IPL (BA40), SFL (BA6) and MCgG (BA23, 24) were activated. Direct comparison between the two conditions found significant activation of left IPL (BA40), IOG and MTG (BA18) in reading the bimanual sentences. Therefore, we conclude that while reading bimanual action sentences, mental simulations occur for bimanual movement as well as for visual experiences.

2012,Effectiveness of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Medial Prefrontal Cortex in Aesthetic Judgement,"Introduction: Among various brain regions involved in aesthetic judgment, Medial prefrontal cortex has a pivotal role in judging the beauty of visual stimuli. It seems that this region’s influence in aesthetic preference is an effect of its role in affective processes. In the following study, we have used transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in order to evaluate the role of medial prefrontal cortex in aesthetic judgment. Method: we used three different types of tDCS stimulation, that is, anodal, cathodal, and sham. 36 participants (18 female) undertook in three experimental sessions randomly in which they received 1mA stimulation for 20 min on their medial prefrontal cortex. Active electrodes were located bilaterally on the forehead and the reference electrode was on the right arm. Ten minutes after the onset of stimulation, subjects got involved in the on-line computerized task of the aesthetic judgment. Results: In general, the effect of tDCS on medial prefrontal cortex on aesthetic judgment was significant F(2 & 37.84)=3.89, p=0.029). The results show that anodal stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex affect the aesthetic preference significantly (p=0.036), while no such effect was seen in cathodal stimulation (p=0.663). There was no sex-related effect (F(1 & 33.48) =3.39, p=0.074).

To test this hypothesis, we manipulated two variables: individual difference in Morphological Awareness (high vs. low MA groups) and sentential context (consistent vs. inconsistent sentences). 152 college students were asked to learn new words appearing within the contexts of a couple of sentences. The sentential contexts on some trials were semantically consistent with one of the possible morphological structures of words to be learned. The participants with higher MA were better at learning new words despite the definitions of words and morphemes were not given explicitly. Also, the words presented in morphologically consistent contexts were learned faster. More importantly, the effect of context differed among MA groups. The supportive context effect was much bigger for the participants of high MA. In conclusion, this study showed the significant effects of morphological representation and processing in learning new words.",>Sungbong Bae>Kwangoh Yi,">Kyungnam University, Korea>Yeungnam University, Korea",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0469/index.html
2012,Distant Border Color Is More Preferred In a Triple Color Combination,"Introduction. Previous studies for color preference are mostly limited to choices of one or two color. We used a novel stimulus, a combination of two adjacent squares with a narrow rectangle (border) in between to assess the effect of a third color in the preference for a color combination. We used this method to evaluate the distance of the border color and two peripheral colors in the DKL color space as a predictor for preference. Method. Stimuli consist of all 504 combinations of 9 selected points in the DKL space. On a rectangular representation of DKL with gray in the middle, 9 points were selected including 4 corners, the center and 4 mid-sides. Each possible combination compared with the rest in a forced two choice task in 3024. 50 subjects (25 female and 25 male) in the range of 20-40 years old participated in the experiment. Results. In general, the greater the sum of distances between colors correlated with more preference in the combinations (T= 3.585, p-value=0.00). In addition, if the border line settles in longer distance from two other colors, it was preferred more (R= -0.726 , p-value= 0.00). Conclusion.

2012,"To peek and to peer: ""visual"" verb meanings are largely unaffected by congenital blindness","Congenitally blind adults learn about the world through touch, audition, and language, but not through vision. What consequences does this atypical sensory experience have for blind adults' concepts of actions and events, especially for features related to vision? One way to assess the structure of concepts is to construct similarity matrices. We elicited similarity judgements for pairs of verbs describing manner of motion (e.g. ""to spin"", ""to strut"", n=15), perceptual experience (e.g. ""to peek"", ""to peer"", n=60), or perceptible qualities (e.g. ""to shimmer"", ""to shine"", n=45). Some of the verbs described qualities or experiences linked to vision. Similarity judgements were acquired from sighted (n=22), late blind (n=9) and congenitally blind (n=24) participants. The similarity ratings for all verb categories, including ""visual"" verbs, were remarkably similar across groups (all r>.85); cluster analyses on similarity ratings produces nearly identical clusters. These results suggest that: 1) verb meanings are largely unaffected by congenital blindness 2) the sensory modality of experience has little effect on conceptual structure.",>Marina Bedny>Jorie Koster-Hale>William Johnston>Lindsay Yazzolino>Rebecca Saxe,>MIT>MIT>MIT>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0471/index.html
2012,Cognitive typology,"This paper presents the dynamic, psycho-cognitive approach to study of human verbal thinking on the basis of typologically different languages /as a Mongolian, English and Russian/. Topological equivalence in verbal communication serves as a basis of Universality of mental structures and therefore deep structures. Mechanism of verbal thinking consisted at the deep level of basic concepts, rules for integration and classification, neural networks of vocabulary. According to the results of psycho-cognitive analysis, semantic bootstrapping serves as a basis of grammatical categories, blending and mental mapping - as a basis for high level linguistic structures (sentence, discource). In terms of typologically different languages, topological structure of discource represents the way in which the individual organizes semantic content, concepts and propositions, in his/her cognitive structure. Comparative analysis of above named languages has shown that analogical mapping, inference between the properties (like space and time, quantity and quality, shape, color, volume structure) present a basis for semantics transformations. Comparative analysis of the influence of language on cognition proposes a pathway for new developments in psycho-cognitive research, particularly for integral generative semantics in 2D and 3D dimensions.

2012,Expert Memory in Blindfold Chess960 - An Interpretation in the light of LIDA,"Chessplayers expert’s perception is heavily theory laden as evidenced by the performance at recalling chess positions of an expert only allowed to glimpse the board for no more than 10 seconds. When the theoretical background is partially destroyed as in Chess 960, the recall under the same conditions is diminished from about 80% correct recalls to less than 60% (in our experiments). The view that ""perception is cognition"" seems to have a relation to the concept of sparse dictionaries in the software framework of learning intelligent distribution agent (LIDA). The particular experiments of this paper argue for the former concept and the probable existence of independent networks of activation of memory such as Damasio’s zones of convergence-divergence, also compatible with the LIDA concept.

2012,Vague Linguistic Expressions and the Problem of Equidistance in Verbal Response Scales,"This contribution examines the problem of equidistance of vague linguistic terms (LT) of verbal response scales, which are used in psychological questionnaires or interviews. The study design (N = 92) employs an empirical translation procedure for the numerical translation of LTs in an example questionnaire (i.e., measuring chronic stress) that utilizes a verbal response scale with frequency expressions (e.g., sometimes). The data are modeled using fuzzy membership functions (MFs) that reflect the LTs’ meanings. Results show that the LTs of the original questionnaire scale are not distributed equidistantly and, therefore, that the presuppositions for data analysis are statistically violated. Further, this violation biases study results in such a way that measured stress levels are overestimated. A proposed alternative scale with different LTs shows nearly equidistant response categories. To solve the problem of equidistance, a fuzzy analysis of response data is presented and compared to conventional analyses.",>Franziska Bocklisch>Josef Krems,>Chemnitz University of Technology>Chemnitz University of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0474/index.html
2012,Going beyond the headlines: Narratives mitigate intergroup empathy bias,"“Three Afghani civilians were killed in a drone strike in Khandahar.” People increasingly get their news from online sources, making it easy to see the world through the prism of headlines, instead of the longer story. What are the consequences of reading just a single sentence encapsulation of world events? We tested the effects of reading “headlines” versus longer narratives, about events happening to in-group versus out-group members, for people assigned to arbitrary competitive groups (Eagles or Rattlers). In four studies, reading just “headlines” exacerbated intergroup differences in empathy: feeling more empathy for in-group members, and more counter-empathic emotions (e.g. Schadenfreude) for outgroup members. Headlines encourage attending to, and therefore remembering, what group a person is from. However, the intergroup empathy bias can be mitigated by providing a short narrative about each individual, which draws attention away from group membership and towards the individual’s experience.",>Emile Bruneau>Mina Cikara>Rebecca Saxe,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0475/index.html
2012,Ordered Information and Word Learning: An Associative Learning Perspective,"A computational associative learning simulation is implemented to gauge the role of temporally ordered information in regards to establishing differently weighted representations. Simulation comparisons are made between two approaches. One approach simultaneously learns multiple sets of cues, which are trained to be associated with their respective outcomes. The other approach separates training into temporally distinct early and late phases. Qualitative differences in weighted representations are observed between the two types of training. Asymmetrical learning of features occurs in the simulation with temporally distinct learning instances, and not in the simultaneous learning model. Negative associations are learned for specific cues when competing information is introduced at a later time point.

We need to figure out whether a set of meanings are realizations of multiple senses of a word or manifestations of a single sense. There have been proposed many diagnostic tests for the distinction. Although they are useful to some degree, none of them are without problems. One of the reasons for these problems is that not all senses are equal on their statuses: there are not only full senses but also sub-senses. It seems to be impossible to set up a fixed set of all-purpose criteria for the distinction. For example, the level of sense discrimination for information retrieval would not have to be as deep as that for inference. In this study, we will focus on characterizing the hierarchical nature of (Korean) word senses, in due consideration of the conceptual units which are building blocks of senses.",>Hee-Rahk Chae>Do-Il Hong,>Hakkuk University of Foreign Studies>Hakkuk University of Foreign Studies,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0477/index.html
2012,Word Segmentation Difficulty in Fourth Graders with Low Reading Achievement,"A series of studies have advertized the benefit of word segmentation in Chinese sentences comprehension for children with reading difficulty. This study attempts to identify the major cognitive factor contributing to this developmental difference among the children with the same age. A sentence reading with word judgment task was designed for a group of children with reading difficulty and a control group of children with normal reading capacity. In each trial of word judgment, a stimuli sentence could follow a word appearing in the critical region, a word appearing in the critical region but without meaning, a word appearing in the uncritical region, or a word disappearing in the sentence. For the words in the critical region, there is a ambiguous segmentation between them, and the children takes more cognitive effort to deny the word without meaning. The current results show the only difference between the two groups on the words without meaning. After excluded the factors such as intelligence and vocabulary, the inefficiency of attention would be the critical to reading difficulty. An improvement method based on a cognitive processing of Chinese sentence reading is suggested in this presentation.",>Sau-chin Chen>Jenn-Yeu Chen,>Tzu Chi University>National Cheng Kung University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0478/index.html
2012,Is the Proximate Unit in Chinese Word Production Motivated by the Visual Prompt of the Task?,"Previous word production research employing the implicit priming paradigm has shown that speakers can benefit from the advanced knowledge of the initial word form of the word to be produced. In Dutch and English, a single onset segment is sufficient to produce the benefit, but a complete syllable is required in Mandarin Chinese. The absence of an onset effect in Mandarin Chinese might have to do with the orthographic characteristics of the prompts, which are syllable-based and could have motivated the production system to place more emphasis on the syllable than on the segment. The present study employed the same paradigm but with spoken prompts in addition. It turned out that there was a syllable effect but not a segment effect, irrespective of the modality of the prompts. The findings suggest that the proximate unit in Mandarin Chinese word production is an intrinsic effect, and not an accidental, task-dependent artifact.",>Train-Min Chen>Jenn-Yeu Chen,">National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0479/index.html
2012,The Impact of Contextual Cues on Infant Categorization,"When Infants perceive and categorize objects in natural environment, they would also found the contextual cues useful. Therefore, how this factor influences infant categorization is an important issue that worth further studying. Experiment in the present study used eye-tracking technique to accurately capture 6-month-old infants’ eye movements in a categorization task, investigating the role the contextual cues would play for categorizing animals and vehicles. The familiarity-novelty preference paradigm was adopted to assess infants’ performance of categorization. It was found that infants looked more to the pictures of vehicles than animals in both congruent and incongruent conditions during the familiarization phase. The results showed that object-context relations play a specific role in infant categorization.

2012,Knowing where to look: Conceptual knowledge guides fixation in an object categorization task,"Increasing evidence suggests that humans are not passive perceivers of the world but actively seek out perceptual information. A pressing question for cognitive science concerns how conceptual representations influence this active perception. To address this question, we investigated fixation patterns during visual object classification while manipulating the level of specificity at which a given item was categorized. Twenty-nine undergraduates verified whether a picture matched a preceding verbal label while their eye-movements were monitored. When pictures (e.g., beaver) were classified at a specific level (BEAVER), participants showed significantly increased dwell time to distinctive features (tail) but decreased dwell time to common features (e.g., face) compared to classification of the same picture at a general level (e.g. ANIMAL) although participants attended to both distinctive and common features in both conditions. The results suggest that conceptual knowledge can substantially influence how viewers direct their gazes and consequently focus on the relevant perceptual information.",>Lang Chen>Timothy Rogers,>University of Wisconsin-Madison>University of Wisconsin-Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0481/index.html
2012,Mindset interacts with subjective knowledge but not fluency when affecting preferential judgment,"Fluency can influence various judgments. When processing fluent information, people think more intuitively than when processing disfluent information. Recent research showed that mindset (abstract vs. concrete) would moderate fluency effects on consumers’ preference. Other research suggested that subjective knowledge (e.g. estimated price) could influence product judgment. In this work, we manipulated mindset (abstract vs. concrete) and the fluency of an advertisement of chocolates (easy vs. hard), tested subjective knowledge of price (high vs. low), and examined the effects of these factors on preference, measured by how much they liked the chocolates (liking), how desirable the chocolates were (desirability), and how much they wanted to eat the chocolates (wanting). We found direct effects of fluency and price, but not mindset, on preference. However, mindset interacted with price to affect liking and wanting. We conclude by discussing why mindset interacts with subjective knowledge, but not fluency, when affecting preferential judgment.",>Rongjuan Chen>Yasuaki Sakamoto,">Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States>Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0482/index.html
2012,A Study of the Syntactic Category of Rhetorical Questions,"A review of the literature on the study of rhetorical questions (RQs) shows that most of the previous studies are aimed to describe the pragmatic function, while the cognitive factor has been considered by relatively few researchers. The major goal of this study is to discuss the syntactic category of RQs under the Prototype Theory of Categorization. The author first set up a theoretical frame for analyzing RQs, suggesting that all grammatical structures are prototypical categories, which fall into a category of syntax, a category of semantics and a category of pragmatics and a category of syntax is a category of different semantic meanings and pragmatic functions expressed by the same syntactic form. An analysis of RQs shows that RQs and genuine questions are in the same syntactic category—QUESTION because they share syntactic similarities.

2012,Eye Movement Patterns Reveal How Oriental People Group Objects,"Past literature pointed out that oriental people tend to consider thematic relationship more than taxonomic relationship (i.e. group banana & apple together more than banana & ape) compared to western people for thematic relationship. However, how oriental people judge the relationship between objects by grouping remains unclear. An eye tracker device was used to examine whether oriental people group objects thematically as the first step to investigate the issue. It was further assumed that people would tend to look longer on the image pairs which are found surprising and unexpected since they group those objects based on specific relationship from an opposite direction. Twenty-three oriental background subjects completed the experiment. The results showed that oriental background participants do view taxonomic pairs significantly longer than the thematic pairs in terms of total fixation duration and total fixation count by which the earlier hypothesis is supported.

The results showed that children with SLI scored lower on CRAT and BRWTB than TD children. Children with DCD scored similarly to TD children on the two reading tests, but scored lower on the writing subtest of BRWRB. The incidence of dyslexia in children with SLI, children with DCD, children with both disorders and TD children is 48.6%, 14.3%, 50% and12.9%, respectively.

2012,The development of numerical comparison in 2- to 4-year-old children,"Infants deploy two cognitive systems that support numerical thinking: one for representing small sets of objects (<4) in parallel, and another for representing large, approximate numerical magnitudes (>4). Despite infants’ demonstrated numerical competence, preschoolers fail to show which of two sets contains more elements until they have acquired some number word meanings (e.g., Brannon & Van deWalle, 2001). However, previous studies mixed up small and large numbers. The current study asked whether preschoolers’ failure depended on the number of elements in sets. Two- to 4-year-olds were shown either small or large numbers of rectangles, and were asked to choose the set that had more. We analyzed children’s performance based on their number word knowledge. Results found that children were better at comparing small than large sets, and numeral acquisition facilitated numerical comparison.

And also for a search of these occurrence mechanisms, we measured the eye movement and negative emotion of the subjects. In the context-dependent effect, a difficult choice between two options is swayed by the presence of a third (normatively irrelevant) alternative. Previous works showed that the attraction effect increase and the compromise effect decrease when people have depleted their mental resources performing a previous self-control task. Moreover, it is thought that the attraction effect arise for the aversion from the negative emotion which feel when the trade-off has been perceived.

2012,Can Articulating Aloud Offset Effects of Listening to L1 in a Foreign Accent?,"The production effect refers to the finding that words that are read aloud are more distinctive and memorable relative to words that are read silently. The present study explored the production effect using auditory stimuli, spoken in two different accents. American participants repeated a word or listened passively to words spoken in either their native accent (English) or a foreign accent (Chinese). In both recall and recognition, memory was better for words that were read aloud rather than listened to, thereby extending the production effect from the visual to the auditory domain. However, the benefit to recognition associated with repeating a word , rather than listening to it, was greater in a native accent. Evidently, the gestures of articulating a word aloud benefit memory but its impact is attenuated by phonetic mismatch between what participants hear and what they produce.",>Kit Cho>Laurie Beth Feldman,">The University at Albany, SUNY>The University at Albany, SUNY & Haskins Labs",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0490/index.html

With the use of extended flashbacks, the truth about the incident, as well as the unlikely connection between the North-South Korean soldiers, discloses. This paper is intended to propose a model of narrative blending associated with the mapping between the investigator’s and the suspects’ spaces in terms of ‘intentionality’ and ‘analogy’ (Fauconnier and Turner, 2002). It will be seen that the contradicting accounts of the soldiers are associated with their intentions, involving memory and fear, this input spaces of soldiers interacting with another input space of Jang.

This paper is intended to propose a model of narrative blending associated with the mapping between the investigator and the suspect spaces in terms of ‘intentionality’ (Fauconnier and Turner, 2002).

2012,"Ten-month-old Infants Prefer Comforters, not Helpers","Preverbal infants prefer characters that help others in achieving a goal (e.g. climbing up a hill), but how this preference is established remains unknown. In current study, we examined physical and emotional outcome hypotheses by presenting 6- and 10-month-old infants a social interaction similar to what was used in Hamlin et al. (2007). During the learning habituation stage, an agent emotionally comforted or upset a climber by pushing it up (helped) or down (hindered) the hill (physical outcome). On a new platform, we found that 10-month-old infants looked significantly longer when the climber approached the comforter who previously made the climber laugh regardless of what physical outcome was. This indicates infants’ prioritization of emotional over physical outcome and their consideration of a third party’s internal state in forming a social preference, which was absent at 6-month-olds. This leads to the conclusion that this prioritization is unlikely to be innate.",>Hiu-Mei Chow>Stephanie Jui-chi Chen>Geroldene H. T.

Twenty-two adults watched short, soundless video clips extracted from recordings of daily conversations, each including a spontaneous representational gesture. Participants were requested to judge whether and in what way the gestures made sense. Their responses showed that in the absence of speech, the idiosyncratic hand configurations were not incomprehensible, suggesting that speech-gesture integration is not entirely obligatory.

2012,Task-specific conflict monitoring and cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex,"According to the conflict monitoring theory, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are involved in detecting (i.e., monitor) and regulating (i.e., controller) the conflict, respectively. However, it has been unknown whether different types of response conflicts recruit the same monitor-controller loop. To address this issue, we developed a double-response-conflict task using color-based and location-based conflict stimuli. This task evoked two types of conflict at the response level either simultaneously or separately, and we tested neural activities in dACC and DLPFC employing the conflict adaptation paradigm. Along with behavioral task-specific conflict adaptation effects, imaging results showed task-specific conflict adaptation in dACC and DLPFC. The results also demonstrated that double-conflict processing appears to be qualitatively different from single-conflicts despite the fact that the sources of double-conflict were overlapped with two single-conflict conditions. These suggest that response conflicts from two different sources are independently processed.",>Chongwook Chung>Chobok Kim>Jeounghoon Kim,">KAIST, Daejeon, KOREA>Kyungpook National University, Daegu, KOREA>KAIST, Daejeon, KOREA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0495/index.html

The results indicates that: (a) there is a radical position regularity effect on orthographic awareness, which means the accuracy of high frequency radical is better than low frequency; (b) children can identify radical position regularity; (c) the ability of radical position awareness turns into stable through the experience of character recognition growing.

2012,The Dynamics of Sentence (In)comprehension,"Comprehension of text develops over time, such that a single word may lead to the activation of different concepts—and thus different expectations—at different times after it is encountered. Since the pioneering work of Neely (1977), much evidence has been found that multiple senses of a word are activated shortly after it is encountered, but that senses that are contextually irrelevant are later inhibited. This has implications for the processing of anomalies in sentences, including malapropisms like switching “antidote” for “anecdote”: if the anomaly is primed by the semantic context (e.g., it is preceded by the word “doctor”) shortly before it is encountered, it should be less likely to be noticed by the reader and is less likely to impede reading (and comprehension) of the sentence. We present results from a reading-time study using sentences in which malapropisms are presented in either neutral or semantically congruent contexts, with the semantic prime at varying distances from the anomaly (e.g., “doctor”, above). These results are interpreted within a dynamic sentence comprehension model based on the attractor model of Tabor, Juliano, & Tanenhaus (1997).",>Gregory Cox>Melody Dye>Seth Frey,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0497/index.html

In English, once we pass into triple digits, we encounter a new class of number: multipliers. Multipliers are characterized by the unique syntactic structure of number + multiplier + noun(pl). 27 children aged 4 to 6 years old were taught a novel word (“gobi”) using the multiplier structure. After being trained to identify one gobi objects, children were tested on their ability to generalize gobi in four additional contexts. Participants fell into one of two distinct groups that either consistently passed or failed all tasks (t(25) = 13.406, p < 0.001).

2012,Describing faces: conventionalizing ontologies through dialogic interaction,"Although we are highly efficient at remembering and recognizing faces, we find it remarkably difficult to describe faces to others. This stems in part from the holistic nature of face representation and the difficulty of expressing configural information in words. However, research on dialogic interaction has shown that when interlocutors encounter a domain for which they possess only vague descriptions, they rapidly conventionalize ad-hoc ontologies that enable efficient and systematic communication. To test the hypothesis that interlocutors will conventionalize ad-hoc ontologies for describing faces, we present data from a collaborative, computer-based task which is played by pairs of participants. Successful completion of the task requires participants to interactively describe and identify target faces from a set of distractors. The data provide evidence of dyads conventionalizing ontologies for referring to faces. Drawing on the observed interactions, we demonstrate how these conventions emerge as a consequence of participants resolving instances of miscommunication.",>Nicolas Davidenko>Gregory Mills,>Stanford University>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0499/index.html

Although previous studies have shown that speaker’s identity affects semantic processing, the influence of speaker’s identity on grammatical processing is less clear. Here we investigate subject-verb agreement in Slovak, when the agreement depends on the speaker’s gender (as cued by his/her voice) compared to when it depends on the formal grammatical gender of the subject. We compared ERP responses to Slovak verbs disagreeing with the formally-marked subject’s gender (e.g., (the) mother-in-lawFEM *stoleMASC plums), and to verbs disagreeing with subject’s gender as conveyed by the speaker’s voice (e.g., IFEM *stoleMASC plums). The formally-marked subject and verb disagreement resulted in a P600 preceded by an anterior negativity. However, disagreement based on the speaker’s voice elicited a posterior negativity but no P600. We will discuss differences in checking or repair mechanisms of these two agreement types.",>Doug J.

As feedback imposes cognitive load, an effective feedback should help reducing the cognitive load. One possible way of reducing the load is using scaffolded feedback, in which hints are incrementally provided until participants generate the correct answer. Scaffolded feedback promoted learning and reduced the cognitive load more than the corrective feedback in Experiment 1, in which knowledge of Korean history was tested. The advantage of the scaffolded feedback disappeared when text comprehension was tested in Experiment 2. However, errors with high confidence are corrected more than errors with low confidence in both experiments.

2012,Computing Humorous Metaphors,"It was experimentally showed that humorous texts can be explained using approaches applied to metaphors, such as the salience-imbalance or the domain-interaction approach. It was also demonstrated that humorous metaphors often include a switch between positive and negative emotions. We propose to construct a computer system able to understand and generate such metaphors. Currently we are constructing a metaphor conceptual network, in which links between concepts are calculated accordingly to their roles in metaphor understanding. This will allow the computer to process metaphors. Next, we will adjust the links distance calculation to match the humorous metaphors (to increase the salience-imbalance, as demonstrated in existing research). We will also use an emotiveness-recognition-system to detect emotive associations towards particular phrases, in order to choose pairs with the emotional switch. The system will be evaluated in user-oriented experiments.

2012,Expanding the Transformation Paths in a Mutual Transformation Mechanism of Music and Narrative,"Music is an important part in the narrative generation system we have been studying, but is not merely the accompaniment of narrative. For the integration of the knowledge and techniques of narrative and music, we developed some versions of the automatic mechanisms which mutually and cyclically transform narrative structures and musical structures using narratological and musical methods. A previous prototyping system consists of various transformation modules: a “music composition” mechanism from a narrative or a story, a “music variation” mechanism from an “original music”, a transformation mechanism from “variation music” to the narrative discourse, etc. This paper’s goal is to add other possible circulation paths to expand the system framework. Specifically, we implement a new “original music” generation mechanism by the re-formation of the original music anew and add a transformation mechanism from “variation music” to the new “original music”. Moreover, we are evaluating the corresponding relationship between narrative and music, and the quality of generated music.",>Jun Endo>Taisuke Akimoto>Takashi Ogata,">Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0504/index.html
2012,Eye tracking differences in respondent behaviour across multiple survey modes,"Research into survey methodology has revealed that respondents answer differently depending on the way in which questions are presented. To date there have been few empirical attempts to relate these differences to respondents’ cognition. To investigate this, we used eye tracking in three different survey modes: a computer-based mode, a pen-and-paper questionnaire and a face-to-face interview with show-cards. This novel method of obtaining cognitive measures across modes means that we are able to investigate attention and cognitive processing by coding which questions and answers are looked at the most in the different settings. The results confirm the attentional biases linked to some responses, such as a bias to the first and last response options in a list, as well as revealing differences in how response options were inspected across modes. These results are discussed and it is proposed that cognitive science can play a significant role in survey methodology.",>Tom Foulsham>Olena Kaminska,>University of Essex>University of Essex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0505/index.html
2012,Automatic facilitation of social behavior by implicit inferring of social intention,"It is known that we can infer others’ intentions and goals automatically. On the other hand, recent researches have demonstrated that people spontaneously adopt and pursue the goals perceived in others’ behavior. This phenomenon is called goal contagion and goal contagion can occur even when the goal is not consciously understood. In this study, we examined whether mere exposure to animated agents’ intentions could influence our social behavior. Participants performed social game while the short animation depicting social intention in the peripheral monitor that participants did not attend to. We found that participants exposed to an animation that implied helping behavior was more cooperative than participants exposed to an animation that implied hindering behavior. In addition, participants could not answer what was displayed in the peripheral monitor in which the animation was displayed. These results suggest that others’ intentions can influence our social behavior without consciousness.",>Haruaki Fukuda>Hiroaki Suzuki>Ayumi Yamada,>Aoyama Gakuin University>Aoyama Gakuin University>Aoyama Gakuin University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0506/index.html
2012,Quantifying linguistic coordination,"Language has been defined as a social coordination device (Clark 1996) enabling innovative modalities of joint action. However, the exact coordinative dynamics over time and their effects are still insufficiently investigated and quantified. Relying on the data produced in a collective decision task (Bahrami et al 2010, Fusaroli et al. 2012) we extend to linguistic coordination dynamical measures of recurrence employed in the analysis of sensorimotor coordination (such as heart-rate (Konvalinka et al 2011), postural sway (Shockley 2005) and eye-movements (Dale, Richardson and Kirkham 2012). We employ nominal recurrence analysis (Orsucci et al 2005, Dale et al 2011) on the decision-making conversations between the participants. We report strong correlations between various indexes of recurrence and collective performance. We argue this method allows us to quantify the qualities of linguistic coordination and their effects at a fine-degree.",>Riccardo Fusaroli>Kristian Tylén,>Aarhus University>Aarhus University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0507/index.html
2012,How a Quantum Approach to Memory Incorporates Contextuality and Potentiality,"Existing models of memory incorporate context in only a limited sense, and they fail to accommodate the complementary notion of potentiality. Humans use context in a multitude of ways: (1) to resolve ambiguity between alternative pre-existing meanings, (2) to emphasize particular aspects of something, (3) to identify new and potentially meaningful relationships, and (4) to clarify an idea such that one’s understanding of it goes from ill-defined to well-defined. A powerful model of memory must capture all four. Drawing on elements of vector based information retrieval models, Gärdenfors’ geometric model of conceptual space, and matrix model of memory, we present a quantum approach to memory, and show how it can capture these four senses of contextuality. Though in its infancy, the quantum approach can provide not just exceptionally high-density memory storage but creative capacities as well.",>Liane Gabora>Kirsty Kitto,>University of British Columbia>Queensland University of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0508/index.html
2012,The Naturalization of Concepts between Computational Intractability and Cognitive Theories,"In this work we present some computational considerations about the nature of concepts. After a first distinction between ""per se"" concepts and the epistemic or psychological aspects of concepts we focus our attention on this latter by linking their understanding to the formalization of automatic classification problems as developed in machine learning field. We show how the problem of categorization and of formation of concepts representing categories, has to be considered a computationally intractable problem that hence can be faced only with heuristic strategies. In this perspective the different cognitive theories proposed in cognitive science to explain categorization processes (e.g. the prototype-theory by E. Rosch), can be considered as different heuristic strategies (computationally tractable solutions) to face the categorization problems and that the human mind uses in order to prevent an unsustainable cognitive-computational load. Finally, we frame these ideas in the cognitive naturalism and in the current viewpoint that considers the most of the human reasoning as heuristic solutions to intractable problems. Our thesis is that concepts can be considered as heuristic and “perspective” solutions that any intelligent system, such as human mind, finds in order to represent categories —using limited resources and capacities— by which it organizes and gives a sense to the large variety of reality that surrounds it.",>Francesco Gagliardi,">University of Rome ""La Sapienza""",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0509/index.html
2012,Selection of decision rules in dynamic decision making,"This study investigates how dynamic complexity influences the use of heuristics in a dynamic decision making task. 24 subjects performed a computerized task that required them to predict the dynamic change (t+1) of discrete interrelated variables (range 0-20). There were four experimental sessions that involved the co-evolution of eight variables over 40 time periods. The level of complexity of the dynamic change of each variable was determined by its distance to linearity. Five heuristics, characterized by different methods of effort-reduction (Shah & Oppenheimer, 2008), were formalized. Forecasting performance of participants was compared against each heuristic. The results revealed that subjects adapt their heuristics to the level of dynamic complexity. Our findings are discussed in relation to the conditions under which individuals adapt decision rules in complex dynamic tasks and on the consequences of such heuristic changes (Hogarth & Karelaia, 2007).",>Jean-François Gagnon>Marie-Ève St-Louis>Sebastien Tremblay,>Université Laval>Université Laval>Université Laval,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0510/index.html
2012,Annual Cognitive Modeling Competition,"Although the cognitive and behavioral modeling communities now have a rather lengthy history and there is ongoing research and development in these areas across dozens of academic, industrial, and government research laboratories, very little of the work has been explicitly competitive. That said, there are precedents for modeling competitions in this area. Two examples include the PokerBot Competition and the Dynamic Stocks and Flows Model Comparison Challenge. Both of these were successful and interesting events. They were also both single shot modeling competitions that did not evolve into annual events in the spirit of something like Robocup or the NIST-sponsored automated speech recognition competitions. It is time to consider a recurring annual cognitive modeling competition.

2012,Do Young Children Habituate to their Classroom Environment?,"Prior research has shown that visual features of the classroom environment (e.g., charts, posters) can be potential sources of distraction hindering children’s ability to attend to the content of a lesson. However, it is possible that over time children may habituate to their classroom environment. To address this possibility we investigated whether more prolonged exposure in a high visual distraction learning environment would result in habituation. We presented 23 kindergartners with 10 science lessons over 2-weeks. A habituation effect was observed as evidenced by a significant decrease in the proportion of time children attended to the environment between week 1 and week 2 (p=0.001). However, the proportion of time children attended to the environment at week 2 remained significantly above baseline levels (p<0.0001). Thus over time children began to habituate to the classroom environment; however, the environment remained a significant source of distraction for young children.",>Karrie Godwin>Anna Fisher,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0512/index.html
2012,Phonological neighbourhood clustering effects on verbal short-term memory,"Phonological similarity between words as measured by neighbourhood density counts the number of words differing from the target word by a single phoneme. The word cat has a denser neighbourhood (e.g. hat, cut, at, scat) than the word wag (e.g. bag, wan). However, density does not capture between-neighbour relationships (hat and at are also neighbours of each other, but bag and wan are not). A recent index called the clustering coefficient measures the proportion of neighbours of a word that are also neighbours of each other. In an immediate serial recall task of 6-word lists using non-repeated sampling, lists of words with high clustering coefficients (i.e. many neighbours were neighbours of each other) were better remembered than those with low clustering coefficients (i.e. few neighbours were neighbours of each other). The findings suggest that a network of overlapping similarities among a to-be-remembered word’s phonological neighbourhood enhances recall in short-term memory.",>Winston Goh,>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0513/index.html
2012,Children's sensitivity to informant's inductive efficiency and learner's epistemic states in pedagogical contexts,"Children use properties of information and epistemic states of others to socially evaluate informants in pedagogical contexts. Recent studies have shown that in pedagogical contexts, children expect teachers to provide information to support accurate inference. Do children simply prefer teachers who provide more information, or do they rationally expect teachers to provide the “right amount” of information? Here we present a computational model of social learning that incorporates the cost of acquiring information and a series of experiments with children (5- and 6-year-olds) to test its predictions. Children observed two teachers who either provided a “minimal” amount of information or “exhaustive” information about a multi-function toy to a naïve learner. Consistent with the predictions of the model, children’s preferences rationally reflected the informativeness of the teachers’ demonstrations, the cost of observing the demonstrations, and even the learner’s epistemic state. Taken together, the results suggest that learners can use information provided by others to not only learn about the target object but also to rationally evaluate others in order to guide their future choices of informants.",>Hyowon Gweon>Patrick Shafto>Joshua Tenenbaum>Laura Schulz,>MIT>University of Louisville>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0514/index.html
2012,The End is Near: Anticipating the end of a sentence,"Hahn (2011) demonstrated that anticipating a final word from local context benefitted from the knowledge that the sentence was ending. In this work, I hypothesized that statistical regularities of text usage would show a building anticipation of the sentence’s end as the ending word sequence is acquired. A text corpus analysis was conducted focusing on 570 common and 570 uncommon sentence endings. A single word (w1) followed by three unspecified intervening words generated a weak average anticipation (p(w5=“.” | w1 ? ? ?) = 0.1) that steadily increased with the accumulation of subsequent words in the ending sequence. The complete four-word context generated a strong average anticipation (p(w5=“.” | w1 w2 w3 w4 ) = 0.8) of the subsequent period that renders the period fairly redundant.",>Lance Hahn,>Western Kentucky University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0515/index.html

We explored how a training study of learning consonant clusters at the very onset of the L2 acquisition can inform us about L2 learning in general and individual differences in particular. Dutch native (L1) speakers were trained on Slovak words with consonant clusters. In the session following training, participants were tested on a battery of L2 perception and production tasks. The battery of tests was repeated twice more with one week between each session. An additional battery of control tests was used to test participants’ L1 skills. Participants showed considerable individual differences across all L2 tasks, stable across sessions. Two participants showed L2 production performance that fell within 2 standard deviations of the mean ratings obtained for an L1 speaker. The mispronunciation detection task was the only perception task, which significantly predicted production performance in the final session.",>Adriana Hanulikova>Dan Dediu>Zhou Fang>Jana Basnakova>Falk Huettig,">Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour>Slovak Academy of Sciences>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0516/index.html

The effects of data-presentation design on the prolonged use of health-related life-log tools,"Although a number of life-log tools for health care have been proposed, they share a common problem; the drop-out problem of achieving long-term continuous usage in users. Providing numerical data is believed to be useful in tackling the problem, but, that can also have adverse effects if people overly react or misinterpret the meaning of the data. To investigate how people react to numerical data, we asked 817 undergraduate students to evaluate some fictitious tools for four domains (e.g., blood pressure) with one of five different designs; with standard or precise figures (with two additional digits), combined with/without interpretive messages for the data (e.g. “good condition”), or no numerical data (message only). The results indicate that involvement in health-care activities is independent of tool evaluation, such that only tool evaluations were strongly influenced by the existence of numerical data.

Previous studies suggested that writers would creatively use the script types for communicating emotional semantic information to readers. Although there are various factors affecting images of referents, how the factors have effects on them has not been investigated sufficiently. We presented Japanese undergraduates with 10 names of ethnic foods unknown to them. The participants read each name written in one of three script types and described the images of its referent. Their descriptions were analyzed by KH Coder (a freeware for text mining). The result shows the images of referents are influenced by the Japanese writing system, general visual features of each script type, and phonological features of words.",>Aya Hatano>Masahiro Amagase>Jun Kawaguchi,>Nagoya University>Nara Women's University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0518/index.html
2012,Is past information useful for evaluating present covariation information? : Effect of irrelevant information on causal judgment,"This study examined how information about the past affects the estimation of present covariation in causal judgment. For example, although lottery stands advertise that they sold the tickets of a big win last year, and buyers tend to buy tickets there, winning the prize this year has no actual connection with past win. However, information about the past has a psychological influence on people in causal judgment. In this experiment, participants observed this year's records of fictitious baseball players and estimated their contract money for the next season. Participants were assigned to either powerful-team or weak-team condition, and were told that their team had finished among the best three or the worst three for ten years. Weak-team group tended to significantly discount the contribution by the player concerned. The result implies that past information should be concerned with dealing the non-cause cases in which the target cause does not occur.",>Ikuko Hattori>Masasi Hattori,>Ritsumeikan University>Ritsumeikan University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0519/index.html
2012,"Visual cognition of ""speed lines"" in comics: Experimental study on speed perception","""Speed lines"" is the abstract lines used in comic to make objects look like they're moving. The number and the length of speed lines are manipulated by comic artists to match the speed they want to express, but few studies have tested their effect on perception of motion of the viewer. To investigate the matter, we conducted an experiment employing prediction-motion task. 19 participants were shown an apparent motion of a ball moving in uniform linear motion, and were told to estimate the speed of the ball. Each ball was presented with one of six patterns of speed lines, 3(number) x2(length). As result, we found that both the number and the length of speed lines have significant effect on subjective speed of the ball. This indicates that the number and the length of speed lines indeed affects viewer's perception of motion, thus plays significant role in comics.",>Hiromasa Hayashi>Goh Matsuda>Yoshiyuki Tamamiya>Kazuo Hiraki,">University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan>University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan>University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan>University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0520/index.html
2012,"Ontology Architecture of a Neuro-psychoanalytical, Computational Model","The paper introduces the ontological knowledge architecture of the psychoanalytical, hierarchical and computational model ARS (Artificial Recognition System). The ontology architecture of the model is represented by a knowledge base. Semantic and individual memories are realized by means of an ontological architecture. These memories are modeled in a triple notation by the knowledge representation languages Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS). Additionally, rules are employed for reasoning in the semantic knowledge base (manipulation rules) and individual knowledge base (action rules). The approach uses RDF and RDFS for the representation of metadata describing the semantic and individual memories. The simulation shows that general concepts are needed to form semantic memory as such. In addition, individual instanced memory is needed for forming individual memory. In conclusion, the ontological approach can be further transferred to the field of building automation by representing domain-specific ontologies (individual) and upper ontologies (semantic).",>Isabella Hinterleitner,>ICT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0521/index.html
2012,The absence of phonetic symbolism to the novel speech sound -comparison of cross-modal correspondence between Chinese and Japanese speakers using Chinese speech sound-,"Phonetic symbolism is a phenomenon that speech sound evokes images based on sensory experiences and thus often discussed with the similarity for cross-modal correspondence. Hirata and Kita (2012) showed cross-modal congruence between brightness/darkness and Chinese speech sound with and without aspiration in Chinese speakers by using Garner's task. In the present study, we examined whether Japanese speakers, which do not have any Chinese knowledge, show cross-modal correspondence to the Chinese speech sound or not. We conducted the same experiment as previous research to Japanese speakers with no Chinese experience. As a result, Chinese speech sounds with aspiration, which resemble voiceless consonants, were not matched with brightness, whereas those without aspiration, which resemble voiced consonants, were not matched with darkness. This result is different to its pattern in Chinese speaker and consequently suggests that phonetic symbolism is affected by the knowledge of the phonemes of its language.",>Sachiko Hirata>Shinichi Kita,>The University of Tokyo>Kobe University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0522/index.html
2012,Longitudinal observation of action slips: A case study of a young child,"The purpose of this study was to investigate action slips during acquisition of a new skill. Whereas most studies on slips have collected action errors of adults using the diary method, we observed a young child’s daily performance using video recordings. One child’s mouse rinsing activities after toothbrushing were recorded for one year from age four to five, and analyzed in terms of action slips as well as microslips—miniature versions of slips. Slips were repeatedly observed when a child took a cup and filled it with water. Quarterly analysis reveals that the total number of slips did not decrease monotonously: whereas two types of slips, commissions and adjustments, decreased over one year, other types increased from Q1 to Q3, then decreased in Q4. This suggests that in the process of the skill acquisition some types of slip may fade out, but others may rise or last out.",>Naoya Hirose,>Kyoto Notre Dame University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0523/index.html
2012,The role of social contexts in adults' word learning,"While numerous studies report the significance of social contexts in infant’s word learning, data concerning adults are scarce. This study aims to fill this gap. Specifically, it investigated the extent to which a number of the parameters associated with joint attention (e.g., direction and timing of eye-gaze between learners and target objects) help adults learn new words (i.e., map new objects with new labels). The study adopted a novel experimental paradigm where live interactions between two learners took place in four different learning contexts. An eye-tracker recorded learners’ eye-gaze during the experiment. Adult learners learned new words most successfully when they shared both the direction and timing of their eye-gaze towards the target objects. In addition, word learning initiated by a leaner alone, without sharing eye-gaze with another, failed to match these results. Overall, this study supports the view that joint attention maximizes adults’ learning of new words.",>Masako Hirotani>Koji Shimada>Shuntaro Okazaki>Hiroki C.

The most basic meaning of the verb is 'to pass food and others through the mouth into the stomach'. This meaning has been extended to other intransitive and transitive verb meanings and auxiliary verb meanings. When presenting the verb to learners of Korean as a Foreign Language (KFL), it should be presented so that learners themselves can infer the extended meanings using a semantic network. To this end, uses of those words meaning 'to eat' in the native languages of KFL learners should be investigated, and common meanings with the Korean verb should be identified. Then, we can create a semantic network of the senses of 'to eat', a network of the basic meanings and extended meanings of mek-ta in Korean and corresponding verbs in other languages.",>Do-Il Hong>Hee-Rahk Chae,>Hankuk University of Foreign Studies>Hankuk University of Foreign Studies,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0525/index.html

Subject relatives (SRCs) are found more frequent than object relatives (ORCs) in corpora; however, the word order of ORCs resembles canonical SVO simple sentences. The present study examined the experienced-based effect of structural frequency and regularity by conducting a simulation in a simple recurrent network, trained on 10000 simple and RC sentences, in the proportions found in Chinese Treebank 7.0. The model contained 18 input and output units and 36 hidden and context units. Network performance was assessed on the level of grammatical prediction error of the next word. Following 10000 training epochs, ORCs performance showed garden-pathing upon encountering disambiguating relativizer due to resemblance to the SVO order in the beginning. For SRCs, which have an irregular verb-first structure, error was high but dropped later at the relativizer, showing sensitivity to language statistics.

2012,A Corpus Survey of Chinese Individual Classifiers,"As of today, there are scarce studies that show us how classifiers are used in real life. While information technology progresses, today’s researchers are privileged to use large-size databases to explore the real usage of classifiers. We selected 386 concrete nouns in Chinese, and looked them up in Chinese GigaWord for their collocating classifiers. Seventy individual classifiers were found to pair up with these 386 nouns. The following questions are of our particular interest: (1) What are the most frequent classifiers in Chinese? (2) On average, what is the number of classifiers paired up with a noun? (3) What is the number of nouns paired up with a classifier? (4) Which semantic dimensions are particularly relevant to the Chinese classifier system? In our data, a noun on average pairs up with 2.839 classifiers, and a classifier category generally contains 16 nouns. The most frequent classifier was zhi1 for animate beings. The noun di4tu2, taking 8 classifiers, is the most flexible noun in our corpus. By corpus data we will also talk about the role of ge0. Concerning the semantic diemsions, Tai (1994) identified four dimensions manifested in Chinese classifier system: animacy, shape, size, and consistency. And he also found a number of miscellaneous cases that reflect part-whole or metonymic relation. Our investigations show that some classifiers are not highly generalized, such as zun1 (for statues), chuang2 (for buildings), sao4 (for vehicles), etc. Those cases hint at the possibility that some classifier categories operate on low-level cassification such as VEHICLE and BUILDING, instead of highly-abstract semantic dimensions.",>Shuping Huang>Jenn-Yeu Chen,">National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan>National Cheng Kung University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0527/index.html
2012,Property activation during the Interpretation of Noun-Noun Compounds,"Noun-noun compounding is the most productive way of word formation in many languages.

In this paper, we carry out three experiments to examine the process of property activation during the interpretation of noun-noun compounds. The first experiment aims at testifying whether we are more inclined to interpret a novel noun-noun compound with reference to analytic or perceptual properties of the referent. The second experiment tests participants’ preference for metaphorical or relational association in interpreting novel noun-noun compounds. The third experiment testifies whether cognitive development has any impact on noun-noun compound interpretation. Results from the experiments indicate that cognitive factors, such as encyclopedic knowledge, conceptual similarities and contiguities, cognitive development, influence the interpretation of novel noun-noun compounds.",>Jie Huang,>Huazhong University of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0528/index.html
2012,Modeling How Naming Experiences Bias Sorting Performance,"Previous studies assume that language specificity might affect naming patterns, whereas perceptual similarity based sorting might be universal. Study 1 was aimed to examine the hypothesis, but it was found that the correlations of sorting based on perceptual similarity between Chinese and Dutch (or French) are surprisingly lower than previous findings. We argue that perceptual similarity might be also affected by naming experiences. In study 2, we adopted backpropagation neural networks to model the sorting patterns observed in Study 1. During training, the inputs of models were composed of the numeric vectors of names and semantic features. Nevertheless, only semantic features were fed to networks for simulating the sorting results. After training, the simulation outcome of networks showed high correlation with the experimental results. These studies suggest that we should reconsider the involvement of naming experiences for the sorting processes.

If the collectivistic thinking style induces people to perceive the illusory figure more holistically and to process the relations among the components, collectivism-primed people are more susceptive to the ML illusion. On the other hand, if the individualistic thinking style induces them to perceive the illusory figure more analytically and to process the components separately, individualism-primed people are less susceptive to the illusion. To study the influence of cultural thinking styles on perceptual illusion, one group of Korean students wrote a story about “myself” for individualism priming and the other group about “our group” for collectivism priming before the illusion task. As expected, the individualism-primed group showed less ML illusion effect than the collectivism-primed group. In summary, this study suggested that cultural thinking styles could affect the basic visual perceptual processes in a top-down way.",>Yiwon Hyun>Donghoon Lee>Hyunjung Shin>Myeong-ho Sohn,">Pusan National University, South Korea>Pusan National University, South Korea>Pusan National University, South Korea>George Washington University, U.S.A.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0530/index.html

Generally, novices acquire them by being coached. Collaborative learning is defined as a method for studying and solving problems together in a group. In this study, subjects were instructed to get skills as collaborative learning for novices. The mastery process of their skills through the collaborative learning was analyzed by focusing on their speech communication and notes. And, the tacit knowledge to get skills and the process to keep it in mind were formulized from a cognitive point of view. The finding was suggested that a collaborative learning helped novices improve skills and share them, but novices could not figure out whether the outcomes were right or not. Furthermore, it was showed importance of getting skills: clues to know if skills are to decline or not, and ability to adjust opinions by collaborative learning.",>Jun Ichikawa>Yugo Takeuchi,">Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University,Nagoya, Aichi, Japan>Department of Information Science, Shizuoka University,Hamamatsu,Shizuoka,Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0531/index.html

Many previous studies have focused on negative confidence bias or absolute accuracy of depressive persons (e.g., Fu et al., 2012). However, it has not been examined how depressive tendency affects relative accuracy. In experiment, participants read four expository texts.

Finally, participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) of Japanese, originally developed by Beck et al (1961). The result showed that there was negative correlation between the score of BDI and relative metacomprehension accuracy. Given that the high score of BDI means serious depressive, this result suggested that depressived persons cannot discriminate the degree of comprehension level between a numbers of texts.",>Kenji Ikeda>Yosuke Hattori>Shinji Kitagami,">Nagoya university,

Although there are some Propp-based story generation systems, the novel characteristics of our system are combining with a comparatively large scale conceptual dictionary, intending a comprehensive implementation of Propp’s theory, and forming a part of our narrative generation system. The central part of the proposed system is a story grammar mechanism that we defined by organizing formally the description of “function”, which means an action seen from the result, and “sub-function”, which is our original name and the concrete action of each function. As other modules, the story grammar has a flexible structure which can be replaced by other story patterns and generated stories can be mutually combined.

In this paper, a computational approach to modeling cognitive process of choice under ambiguous probability by using cellular automata is proposed. By designing cellular automaton in a torus consisting of ""local matches"" with the state transition rule by stochastic local q-majority vote, which is considered as a model of the working memory of decision maker, this paradox can be simulated. In addition, a similar but differently used version of this model can simulate the event-splitting effect which is known to induce, or eliminate, violation of first order stochastic dominance.",>Kenryo Indo,>Kanto Gakuen University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0534/index.html
2012,The effects of frameworks and examples in learning how to solve word problems,"The study aimed at finding the way to facilitate students’ ability to solve proportion word problems. Previous research suggested two different ideas on abstract framework: abstract framework was less effective than examples; abstract representations would be effective in complex problems. Therefore, we focused on the abstractness of framework and the complexity of the problems. We compared problem solving performance of students in three classes with different abstractness in teaching how to solve proportion word problems. In “no formula” class (N=20), the teacher only showed correct expressions and answers; in “abstract formula” class (N=24), the teacher showed abstract formula to solve proportion problems; and in “situation formula” class (N=23), the teacher showed more grounded formula. The results indicated that the students in “no formula” did better than those in “abstract formula” condition. The effects of abstract frameworks and examples, and the complexity and transformation of the problems were discussed.",>Miwa Inuzuka>Hirosuke Tanimoto>Hiroko Kobayashi,>Taisho University>Oshimanishi Junior Highschool>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0535/index.html
2012,Social Projection as a Universal Strategy in Mental State Inference: Cultural Differences in Utilization of Stereotyping,"It has been argued that people selectively use two strategies, projection and stereotyping, for inferring mental states of the others. Through a series of experiments, Ames (2004) confirmed the hypothesis that, when a target person is perceived to be similar to oneself, people project one’s own mental states to the other; when a target is perceived to be dissimilar, stereotype of a group/category the target person belongs to is used for mental state inferences. In this study, we replicated Ames(2004)’s experiment in Japan and found that Japanese participants employed the projection unanimously regardless of the perceived similarity to the target person. We interpret this result with Yuki(2003) which argued East Asians perceive a social group as a network of independent people while Americans perceive a group as an entity. Our results thus suggest that stereotyping is a cultural-specific strategy while projection is a universal strategy employed in mental state inference.",>Tatsunori Ishii>Masanori Takezawa,">Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan>Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0536/index.html
2012,Functions for mutual interaction with the mind reading,"In the interaction with others, we read other's mind or estimate other's inner states, and utilize them for predicting other's behavior and deciding own behavior. Moreover, we utilize them for making someone do as we wished. In this study, we attempt to propose required functions for decision making of own and other's behavior depending on the mind reading processes and suggested mechanisms for realize these functions. Three investigational situations such as advising clothes to a customer, explanation of operating procedures, and misleading the other's belief were conducted and decision making processes of own behavior were analyzed depending on the recorded conversation during these situations or interview on video-playback. These results proposed two required functions: 1) acquisition of other's view of environment and detection of differences between own and other's view, 2) estimation of other's rules for decision making and operating them along with own will.",>Satoru Ishikawa,">Hokusei Gakuen University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0537/index.html
2012,The anger superiority effect in children with and without autism,"In the face recognition research, it is well known that angry faces are detected more quickly than happy or neutral faces because of the attention-getting property provided with such threatening stimuli. This rapid processing to the threat, usually referred to as ""the anger superiority effect"", is thought to be automatic and inherent. Here, we examined the angry superiority effect in children with and without autism spectrum disorders (ASD) using visual search paradigm. Results revealed that the effect of emotion is correlated with age in children with ASD, but not in typically developing children. In addition, children with ASD under 9 years did not show the anger superiority effect whereas it was confirmed in typically developing children of the same age and even in younger ages. Children with ASD would be delayed for acquisition of those cognitive effects, which might be related to their delay of acquisition of variable social skills.",>Tomoko Isomura>Hiroyasu Ito>Shino Ogawa>Miwa Fukushima>Masahiro Shibasaki>Nobuo Masataka,">Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University>Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University>Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University>Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, Tokyo University>Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University>Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0538/index.html

The results supported these hypotheses, and inspection of the regression relationships suggested that the inter-group variations in test-performance were likely to result from differences in the attention accorded to contextual information, as revealed by the drawings. Social and environmental explanations for the group-differences in contexts ensitivity are also discussed. The conclusions support the argument that cultural differences in artistic styles and perceptual tests reflect the same underlying perceptual tendencies, and are consistent with the argument that these tendencies reflect corresponding differences in patterns of social and environmental interaction.",>Kirill Istomin>Jaroslava Bagdasarova>Patrick Heady,">Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, Halle (Saale), Germany>Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology>Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0539/index.html

Seventeen school age children with autism and 17 age- and ability-matched typical children took port in the experiments. Two toys (a doll of robot and electric switch toy) were set on an architectural replica of house, and these were on a white styrofoam board. Children were instructed to search arbitrary rule that is relation between the position of robot and an on/off of electric switch toy. Children with autism solve the rule of logical AND and XOR problem (exclusive or problem) as good as typical children, but it was more difficult for children with autism to solve the rule of XOR in the big house replica on which there are many replicas of furniture than typical children.

Participants made judgments on whether they would get vaccinated on the basis of the information. The number of participants who responded that they would get vaccinated was significantly different across problems. More participants responded that they would get vaccinated when the base rate was 800 out of 1000 than when it was 1 out of 1000. If the base rates were the same, more participants responded that they would get vaccinated when the likelihood was 15% than when it was 75%. These results suggest that people make intuitive probabilistic judgments on the basis of both base rates and likelihoods.",>Tomoko Itoh,>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science / Waseda University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0541/index.html
2012,Representational Form and Metaphorical Word Use,"How does semantic representation influence the likelihood that a word will be used metaphorically? We explore whether words whose meanings are defined by relations among entities (e.g., marriage, forget), are more likely to be used metaphorically than words whose meanings are defined by features of entities (e.g., bird). Verbs are generally more relational than nouns (Gentner, 1981). Relationality can also distinguish different kinds of nouns: specifically, relational nouns (e.g., marriage) vs. entity nouns (e.g., bird) (Gentner & Kurtz, 2005; Goldwater, Markman, & Stilwell, 2011; Markman & Stilwell, 2001). Prior studies have shown that the meanings of relational words are more mutable across contexts than those of entity words (Gentner & France, 1988; Asmuth & Gentner, under review). Extending this work, we find that uses of relational words (both verbs and relational nouns) tend to be more metaphorical than uses of entity nouns in natural language corpora.",>Anja Jamrozik>Micah Goldwater>Eyal Sagi>Dedre Gentner,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0542/index.html
2012,Interaction between ability and use of scaffold in EFL vocabulary learning system,"This study clarified self-regulated learning processes in EFL in order to propose a more adaptive learning system. We developed an English vocabulary learning system for Japanese. It presented each word in an example sentence and the Japanese translation of the sentence except for the target word upon user request. We sought to examine how learners use this system as a scaffold. Five college students of lower and intermediate ability used the system for six weeks and took exams. We found that the intermediate-ability group learned more vocabulary than the lower-ability group, even when compared to similar-level students using another system that provided only words and translation. Process analyses revealed that the lower-ability group depended on help all through the period, while the intermediate-ability group decreased its use gradually as if to check their learnability. This suggests that the future system have both scaffolding and fading-out functions adaptable to learning states.",>Felix Jimenez>Masayoshi Kanoh,">Chukyo University, Toyota, Aichi Pref, Japan>Chukyo University, Toyota, Aichi Pref, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0543/index.html
2012,Qualitative differences in sequence planning with everyday objects in traumatic brain injured individuals,"The present study aimed to characterize what errors in sequential tasks that traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects make relative to controls. Subjects (8 healthy controls, 6 TBI subjects) completed a computerized grocery bagging task on a touchscreen that required bagging items according to object properties. Relative to controls, TBI subjects produced marginally more errors overall. However, the TBI group had different error profiles than the control group. Specifically, on trials that required a nested rule (i.e. clumping items according to temperature and ordering these same items in terms of weight), the TBI group had more than twice as many errors as controls. This performance deficit is specific to nested rules as the TBI error rates did not differ relative to controls on trials that required multiple rules that were not nested. These findings suggest that planning deficits from TBI cannot simply be due to increased memory load of number of rules but instead is more specific to sequence planning.",>Arianne Johnson>Scott Grafton,">University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0544/index.html
2012,Differential Effects of the Cultural Orientation Dimensions on Global Precedence,"This study investigated the differential effects of individualism-collectivism dimension (ICD) and horizontal-vertical dimension (HVD) in cultural orientation of individuals in the same cultural background on global precedence. The participants were classified into ICD and HVD groups, and asked to respond to compound stimuli which were varied by stimuli types (figure/letter) and stimulus-stimulus (S-S) congruence. Differences in global precedence were compared. The results showed the followings. First, although global precedence was larger in the compound figure than in the compound letter, and larger in the S-S incongruent condition than the congruent condition, none of cultural orientation dimensions made any difference. Second, ICD and HVD affected global precedence independently. Third, a significant interaction effect between HVD and S-S congruence was found, but there was no interaction between ICD and S-S congruence. These results indicated HVD rather than ICD can be a more valid dimension to compare the effect of individual differences in cultural orientation on global precedence.",>Mijung Joo>Hyunmin Kang>Hyunjung Shin>Jaesik Lee,>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0545/index.html

(2004, 2006) and Jung & Hummel (2009, 2011) showed that people have great difficulty learning relation-based categories with a probabilistic (i.e., family resemblance) structure, in which no single relation is shared by all members of a category. Yet acquisition of such categories is not strictly impossible: In all these studies, roughly half the subjects eventually reached criterion. What are these subjects doing that the other half are not? We hypothesized that successful subjects were those who divided the nominal categories into two or more sub-categories, each of which individually has a deterministic structure. We report an experiment testing and supporting this hypothesis: Explicitly presenting subjects with hierarchical (category and sub-category) structures facilitated the acquisition of otherwise probabilistic relational categories.",>Wookyoung Jung>John Hummel,>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0546/index.html
2012,Dynamic Effects of Perceptual and Categorical Similarity on Recognition Memory,"Memory is sensitive to several aspects of its contents, including item similarity (Tulving, 1981) and value (Kachergis, Recchia, & Shiffrin, 2011). For the present study, we developed and scaled a new class of blob-shaped stimuli in order to manipulate item similarity. In two experiments, participants studied blob-point value pairs, with categories defined by valence (positive/negative point values) and by perceptual similarity of the stimuli. Using a dynamic 2AFC decision-making paradigm with a response deadline, we recorded response trajectories for different foil types (e.g., similar to the target, or unique). We find similarity effects in recognition memory and semi-paradoxical category size effects in accord with Tulving (1981). Interpretation of the accuracy effects is enhanced by examining the shape and timing of response trajectories, allowing us to measure phenomena such as decision reversals. Finally, we present a general Gaussian process regression framework to analyze such continuous response data (Cox, Kachergis, & Shiffrin, submitted).",>George Kachergis>Gregory Cox>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0547/index.html
2012,Asymmetricity of McGurk Effect Depending on the Orientation of Faces,"We examined whether the McGurk effect depends on speaker’s facial orientation. Speakers’ vocalizing scenes of, /ba/, /da/, and /ga/ were videotaped in two angles from the left and the right. A voice and a face were congruently or incongruently combined. The experimental stimuli were edited to produce normal and mirror-inverted versions of each audio-visual pair. Participants were asked to report the syllable as they heard by free description. The result replicated the McGurk effect. The error rates were higher for the mirror-inverted right-looking faces (seen as left-looking) than for the mirror-inverted left-looking faces (seen as right-looking). And the error rates were higher for the mirror-inverted right-looking faces (seen as left-looking) than for the normal right-looking faces. These results suggest that left-looking faces enhance the McGurk effect, while differences in physical movements of the left and right sides of speaker’s mouth could be also relevant.",>Masayo Kajimura>Hiroshi Ashida,>Kyoto University>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0548/index.html
2012,An Optimality Theoretical Analysis of Urge Interactions in Toda's (1982) Emotional Fungus-Eater Robots,"Toda's (1982) Urge Theory of Emotions (TUTE) is a deductive theory of emotion and cognition. The TUTE is deductive in that one of thrusts of the TUTE is a detailed analysis of individual emotions as necessary softwares of robots named Fungus-Eaters working on an imaginary planet. The Urges are built-in motivational subroutines for making decisions and executing action plans in order to solve survival problems in a wild environment. The urges are supposed to interact in a situation but not to be absolute but violable. However, the nature of the urge interactions remains to be clarified. The purpose of this study is to apply Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky, 2004) to an analysis of the urge interactions because OT is a theory of interactions of violable constraints. The application makes the urge interactions more visible by means of tableau and accessible for scrutiny than in the TUTE.",>Yasuo Kaneko,>Kushiro Public University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0549/index.html
2012,A signal detection analysis of the effects of repeated context on visual search,"When searching for a target in a scene, previously learned spatial context can facilitate response times (Chun & Jiang, 1998). However, it has been debated whether this is driven by attentional guidance (Chun, 2000; Geyer et al., 2010) or response selection processes (Kunar et al., 2007; Kunar & Wolfe, 2011). To address this issue, 18 subjects performed a visual search task in which (a) the spatial configuration was either repeated or novel, and (b) the target was either present or absent. The present/absent manipulation permitted signal detection computations to decouple perceptual sensitivity (d’) and response bias (β). Average RT was faster (p < 0.01) and d’ was increased (p < 0.03) for repeated displays, but there was no effect on β (p > 0.45). These results suggest that early perceptual processes, as opposed to response processes, may provide a greater contribution to the benefits of repeated context in visual search.",>Ryan Kasper>Miguel Eckstein>Barry Giesbrecht,">University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, United States>University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, United States>University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0550/index.html

The degree of effectiveness of authority brought about by status difference naturally varies across different cultural groups. But, the way in which authority manifests itself in joint decision making situations also changes in different cultural groups. We have been studying cultural variations in dialogue interaction styles through the examination of Mister O corpus, a task-oriented dialogue corpus which has been collected over several languages, including Japanese, English and Arabic. We identified a contrastive manifestations of authority in Mister O dialogues, which can be characterized in terms of different emphasis on competence and deference.

2012,Differences in emotional bias effect on working memory in elderly.,"This study investigated age-related differences in the inhibition mechanism for negative emotional information and in the facilitation mechanism for positive emotional information in working memory. Thirty-six older and thirty-six younger adults performed three RSTs: the neutral, negative, and positive emotional conditions. For each RST condition, all target words were neutral words, while the sentences themselves corresponded to the conditions. In older adults, the percentage of correct responses in the negative condition was worse than that of the neutral condition. Conversely, in younger adults, there was no significant difference between the neutral and negative conditions. In contrast, performance in the positive condition was better than the neutral condition for both age groups. These results suggest that the inhibition of negative information comes at a greater cost to older adults compared to younger adults, but the benefit of the positive information is the same in both age groups.",>Maya Katsuhara>Mariko Osaka>Naoyuki Osaka,>Kyoto university>Osaka university>Kyoto university,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0552/index.html
2012,Mental rotation of pictured body stimuli: Involvement of visual representation of the stimuli,"The present study investigated whether the time required for recognizing rotated body stimuli was matched strictly with the magnitude of correspondence regarding rotation angles between the stimulus and the body. Twelve young adults sat in front the computer monitor while their body was facing to it (no body rotation) or was rotating to the side by 90 degrees. They classified a body stimulus (hand or foot) presented with one of four orientations (0°, 90°, 180°, -90°) according to their laterality. The result showed that the time required for the classification was generally matched with the magnitude of correspondence regarding the rotation angles. However, the classification time was the longest for the 180-deg rotated stimulus even while the body was rotated by 90 degrees, demonstrating that the magnitude of rotation of the body stimuli itself affected the MR. It is likely that visual representation of the stimuli, as well as the body schema, is involved in the MR.",>Tsubasa Kawasaki>Takahiro Higuchi,>Tokyo Metropolitan University>Tokyo Metropolitan University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0553/index.html
2012,"Extracting the Musical Schema from Traditional Japanese, Chinese and German Folk Songs","In this study, we extract the pitch transition patterns from traditional Japanese, Chinese and German folk songs, and examine the characteristics of their respective schema. We sample 1,794 works from Nihon Min-yo Taikan for Japanese folk songs, 1,984 and 2,286 works from a website providing virtual musical scores for both Chinese and German folk songs, respectively. Our main method of extracting pitch transition patterns is to fit variable-length Markov chains (VLMCs) from musical data. A variable-length Markov chain model is a Markovian process having a sparse memory structure with some states that closely cohere. The structure can be characterized by a parsimonious number of transition probabilities for stationary categorical time series. The results indicate that the minimal structures of Japanese folk songs tend to create a longer schema than other two folk songs, while the minimal structures of both Chinese and German folk songs tend to create a shorter schema.",>Akihiro Kawase,>Tokyo Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0554/index.html

In learning phase, low contrast characters were presented sequentially to one of the eyes. Conscious perception of the characters was suppressed by flash streams presented to the other eye (continuous flash suppression). The character streams consisted of quadruplets of fixed order characters, and the order of the quadruplets was randomized. The characters were selected from Yi script that was new to the subjects. In testing phase, the quadruplets were presented to the both eyes, and the subjects hit the key as soon as the target character appeared. If the subjects respond faster when the position of the target was later in the quadruplets, it is likely that they had learned the order of the stimuli. Preliminary data suggests that the learning on the order of novel visual stimuli occurred under interocular suppression.",>Kaede Kido>Shogo Makioka,>Osaka prefecture university>Osaka prefecture university,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0555/index.html
2012,Hierarchical Slow-Feature Models of Gesture Conversation,"How do humans interact with each other using gestures? How do they catch the semantics of gestures to predict or react to them? We explore hierarchical slow-feature models to obtain the high-level semantics in conducting gesture conversations. We adopt the hypernetwork model as a basic component to learn the elementary semantics of gestures, and combine two hypernetworks with an added upper-layer of slow features to learn the temporal transition of semantics. This hierarchical slow-feature model abstracts the low-level features of joint angles to the slowly-changing high-level features which represent higher-level semantics of the gestures. This model also learns the probability of the partner’s next gesture given the gesture of one person at a semantic level. We experimented with the Kinect motion capture device to record the gestures of two subjects in gesture conversation scenarios. The human gesture data was used to train the hierarchical slow-feature model to predict the gesture conversations. The trained model is then transfered to the Darwin humanoid robot.

2012,‘Is this right?’ or ‘Is that wrong?’: Evidence from Dynamic Eye-Hand Movement in Decision Making,"Eye tracking and hand motion (or mouse) tracking are complementary techniques to study the dynamics underlying human cognition. Eye tracking provides information about attention, reasoning, mental imagery, but figuring out the dynamics of cognition is hard. On the other hand, hand movement reveals the hidden states of high-level cognition as a continuous trajectory, but the detailed process is difficult to infer. Here, we use both eye and hand tracking while the subject watches a video drama and plays a multimodal memory game (MMG), a memory recall task designed to investigate the mechanism of recalling the contents of dramas. Our experimental results show that eye tracking and mouse tacking provide complementary information on cognitive processes.

2012,State Anxiety and the Processing of Covariation Information in Causal Reasoning,"The phenomena of conditionalization and discounting have been studied as reflection of attention to multiple potential causes in causal reasoning. And it has been observed that individual-difference factors significantly influence causal reasoning. Specifically, previous studies showed that sociality anxiety related factors such as self-construal influence levels of conditionalization and discounting. In this study, we further specified the relationship between anxiety and the two mechanisms in causal reasoning. We manipulated participants’ levels of state anxiety and found that participants with a relatively greater state anxiety showed a greater propensity to discount their judgment on an alternative cause. But this pattern was not observed in conditionalization between participants with two different levels (high vs. low) of state anxiety. First, these results suggest that conditionalization and discounting are independent to each other, further supporting previous studies.

In addition, focusing on the contradictory results of previous studies, we investigated the effect of instruction: In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to rate the preference of the scenes, whereas they were informed the recognition test beforehand in Experiment 2. The results supported the hypothesis: The collectivism- primed participants pay more attention to the figure-ground relevance information than the individualism-primed ones. However, the difference was disappeared in Experiment 2. It was suggested that intention to memorize scenes can affect the attentional allocation to the targets and the grounds regardless of the cultural dispositions.",>Bia Kim>Yoonkyoung Lee>Donghoon Lee>Goeun Lee>HyunJung Shin,>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0559/index.html
2012,Complex Network Analysis of Social Relationships and Personality from TV Drama Dialogues,"Dialogues are linguistic interactions between people and can provide hints on social relationship and personality. We aim to analyze the social relationships of the characters in TV dramas based on dialogues. In addition to knowing just who talks to whom, the analysis of dialogue content gives more detailed information on the types of interaction, e.g. asking or informing, and the emotional status. We use complex network measures, such as path lengths, geodesics, cluster coefficient, and centrality, to analyze the structural and functional properties of the dialogue network. Among others, we found the betweenness centrality measure informative for identifying the social relationships since this assesses the importance of a node in a complex network in which small worldness is inherent. Analyzing the complete corpus of TV drama “Friends” aired for 10 years, we discovered the connector nodes which are essentially the social equivalent of a hub of computer network. Complexity measures of the dialogue network also help characterize the personality of the main characters in the dramas we studied.

Based on this mass noun view, many linguists argue that there is no count-mass distinction in numeral classifier languages. I show that the mass noun view based on simple morpho-syntactic analogies between English and numeral classifier languages has a number of problems both in theory and in the interpretation of the data.

2012,Automaticity in Motor Learning: Evidence from Visuo-motor Tracking Performance and Pupil Dilation,"Motor learning has traditionally been associated with the concept of automaticity. Automaticity refers to the reduction of the cognitive effort required to perform a motor task, as learning progresses. However, there is little detailed consensus in the literature on what the process of automatization actually involves. We measured tracking performance in two groups of participants while either the target or the manual cursor was suppressed for a brief period during each trial. Subjects learned to maintain accurate tracking through periods of target or cursor suppression. We have used this approach to investigate the internal models used during tracking, and their updating during motor learning. We have simultaneously measured tracking performance and pupil dilation as a measure of cognitive load. The results showed that pupil diameter decreases with learning process of tracking performance. Decrease of pupil diameter suggests that automatization is linked specifically to the learning of internal models.",>Satoshi Kobori>Yosuke Abe>Shogo Nakazono,>Ryukoku Unversity>Ryukoku Unversity>Ryukoku Unversity,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0564/index.html
2012,Self-Organization of Policy by Symmetric Reasoning and its Application to Reinforcement Learning,"The real limitations to our cognition and our locality lead to the exploration-exploitation dilemma and hence the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Considering that all creatures especially animals efficiently deal with the tradeoff, it is natural to suppose we can intuitively handle the dilemma. We adopt the loosely symmetric (LS) formula as a toy model of our intuitive judgment. LS, a kind of biased conditional probability, is known to precisely describe our probability judgment and to go beyond the ordinary tradeoff of speed and accuracy in two-armed bandit problems. In this study, we give analyses of LS in relation to its information theoretical and logical-probabilistic nature. Along with the analyses, we extend LS from a conditional probability to a general value function. The efficacy of LS in decision-making under risk and reinforcement learning is proven by experiments and simulations.",>Yu Kohno>Tatsuji Takahashi,>Tokyo Denki University>Tokyo Denki University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0565/index.html
2012,Study on Facilitation of Problem Posing by Learning Examples through Reproduction,"In general education, learning of production tasks is important but difficult due to it requires heavy cognitive activities such as generation of ideas and synthesis of structures. We proposed a method to facilitate a production task of mathematical problem posing through learning by reproducing examples. In the proposed method, learners learn essential ideas by reproducing examples based on process information indicating how to compose them. We then conducted an experimental investigation where undergraduate students posed their own problems after learning an example by reproducing or solving it. Our previous study had confirmed that undergraduate students without learning of any examples posed many problems that had simple and inappropriate solution structures. In this study, undergraduate students who learned by reproducing the example posed many complex problems, whereas those who learned by solving it didn't do. This proved that learning of ideas for a production task is more effective when it's done through a productive activity.",>Kazuaki Kojima>Kazuhisa Miwa>Tatsunori Matsui,>Waseda University>Nagoya University>Waseda University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0566/index.html

In two experiments, participants guided a human-like agent through a virtual maze. They were instructed to use an allocentric frame of reference (an agent-centered frame of reference) to guide the agent through a maze in Experiment 1. Additionally, they were instructed to represent their own orientations during navigation and to answer their own orientations at a maze's goal in Experiment 2. We controlled experimentally sizes of mazes and analyzed participants' patterns and reaction times of selecting a direction of movement for the agent in the two experiments. The results showed that a representation of an egocentric orientation influenced selecting an allocentric frame of reference in maze navigation depending on a size of a maze.",>Takatsugu Kojima,>Shiga University of Medical Science,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0567/index.html
2012,"Consciousness and the language faculty: awareness, qualia and natural language using agents","I would like to begin with the role of language in settling the problem of consciousness. Some expressions of our everyday language (“entering the consciousness”, “accesible to consciousness” “consciousness reads”) suggest the wrong idea of the phenomenon, namely consciousness as something external in relation to mental states. My first claim is that mental states are conscious due to some internal property. Accepting Chalmers' disctinction between psychological and phenomenal consciousness I will analyse functioning of a natural language processing agent of the SNePS system and indicate hypothesized places and roles for psychological consciousness. Although explaining the language faculty requires taking into account only awareness, language is also inseparably connected with qualia. Answering the question why qualia accompany some (and what) aspects of language, I will speculate that qualia (regardless their experiential character) have a function similar to Damasio's “somatic marker”: they allow a kind of pre-processing, triggering psychological mechanisms.",>Piotr Konderak,">Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin, Poland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0568/index.html
2012,Three co-creation stages in formation of symbol communication systems,"In Konno et al.'s (in press) experiment of co-creation of artificial language, it has been confirmed that a formation pattern had three stages: the establishment of conventional behavior, symbol system and division of roles using turn-taking. However, forty percent of participants failed the formation. We consider that a cause of the failure lies in difficulty of separation among the three stages which demand learning at different levels. Thus we designed three tasks in order to separate the three stages explicitly. Consequently, all twelve pairs completed the co-creation task, and the differences between two experiment's final scores were significant. This indicates that the order of establishment would lead to form an effective symbol communication system. We suggest that the order has an effect of scaffolding the formation. Finally, we will discuss whether the order has an effect of starting small (Elman, 1993) for the learning at the different levels.",>Takeshi Konno>Junya Morita>Akihito Kishino>Takashi Hashimoto>Jiro Okuda>Maki Suzuki,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Kyoto Sangyo University>Kyoto Sangyo University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0569/index.html
2012,Theory of Mind network encodes how you know what you know in blind and sighted adults,"‘Theory of Mind’ (ToM) is the ability to reason about mental experiences such as beliefs and desires. ToM depends on a specific network of brain regions, including the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). We investigated whether these brain regions distinguish between others' mental states experienced through seeing vs hearing ('Sarah saw that', vs 'Sarah heard that'), using multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA). We find that the spatial pattern in the RTPJ distinguishes stories about mental states experienced through hearing vs. seeing (i.e. source) but not other salient distinctions, such as the positive vs. negative affective valence of the mental state. To investigate effects of first-person experience on these representations, we repeated the experiment in congenitally blind participants. Again, MVPA in the RTPJ distinguished source but not valence. We conclude that 1) the source information of someone else's mental state is coded in ToM brain regions and is a feature of ToM, and 2) these ToM representations of perceptual source are not based on first-person perceptual experiences.",>Jorie Koster-Hale>Rebecca Saxe>Marina Bedny,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0570/index.html
2012,A joint ideomotor effect increases the inter-brain oscillation between two people engaged in a Japanese Ouija board “Kokkuri-san”.,"We investigated the inter-brain activity coherence recorded by an EEG between two participants when playing at Kokkuri-san, a Japanese Ouija board. The Ouija aboard, known as a spirit key board or talking board, is a flat board, marked with the letters of the alphabet, numbers, or words (“yes” or “no”). While playing at the Ouija board, two or more participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it moves about the board and spells out words. The Ouija’s actions are generally considered to be due to the ideomotor effect. The EEG results showed that inter-brain activity coherence was observed more dominant in the temporo-parietal junction when the participants shared the goal (in this case, “yes” or “no”) than when they did not. These results suggest that shared ideomotor effects produce brain oscillations in the cortical area, which are used for mentalizing.",>Kenta Kubo>Kentaro Katahira>Kazuo Okanoya>Masato Okada>Nobuyuki Kawai,>Japan Science and Technology Agency>Japan Science and Technology Agency>University of Tokyo>University of Tokyo>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0571/index.html
2012,A Framework of Sentence Generation Mechanism for a Narrative Generation System,"For language representation in our narrative generation system, we have used a simple sentence generation mechanism. This paper discuss the more comprehensive framework. The approach contains linguistic aspect and strategic or controlling aspect. For the former, we developed programs for word order transformation, verb conjugation operation, complex sentence generation, and letter notation selection. The last function uses a language dictionary for nouns and verbs connected to a conceptual dictionary for noun and verb concepts. For the latter, we use the category of “voice” in Genette’s narrative discourse theory, which means a concept to define the feature and relationship of narrator and narratee to decide the strategy and direction of discourse and language generation. In this paper, based on the developed sentence generation programs, we propose a comprehensive framework consisting of the definition of narrator & narratee, strategic decision rules, and concrete sentence operation modules.",>Shinya Kumagai>Sou Funakoshi>Junpei Ono>Taisuke Akimoto>Takashi Ogata,">Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan>Iwate prefuctural university, Iwate, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0572/index.html
2012,An on-line model of quantifiers interpretation in Japanese,"The present project investigates apparently paradoxical phenomena concerning quantificational expressions in Japanese sentence processing as follows. Given structurally ambiguous sentences, (i) when both the nominative and the accusative NPs are bare nouns (nouns without quantifier, interpreted existentially), the garden path (GP) effect is observed, while (ii) when either one of the NPs has a quantifier such as _subeteno_ 'all/every', the GP effect reduces, but (iii) when both are quantified, the GP effect reemerges. The question is: if the existence of one quantifier reduces the GP effect, why not two? We argue that in (ii) the scope interaction of the quantifier and the bare noun is computed, which retards the syntactic processing, resulting in the low GP effect. On the other hand, in (iii), because of its complexity, the scope interaction is not computed, and those quantifiers are treated as non- quantificational, group objects.",>Takeo Kurafuji>Masakatsu Inoue>Michinao Matsui,>Ritsumeikan University>Mukogawa Women's University>Osaka Health Science University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0573/index.html
2012,Beauty and Cuteness in Peripheral Vision,"Previous research suggests that attractiveness is not only detectable in the central visual field but also in the periphery. In Japan, visual “attractiveness” of people is often described in terms of beauty and cuteness (“kawaii”). We examined how perception of facial attractiveness in those two aspects can be different in peripheral vision where special resolution is deteriorated. Pairs of female face images were presented at several eccentricities, and participants judged which was better in terms of beauty or cuteness. The results showed that participants were able to judge both beauty and cuteness in the periphery. The discrimination performance, however, differed; beauty was more detectable in the periphery than in the parafovea, while cuteness was more detectable in the parafovea. This result suggests that detection of beauty might be ecologically more important for humans. Moreover, there were some gender differences, which may reflect different meaning of facial attractiveness for each gender.",>Kana Kuraguchi>Hiroshi Ashida,">Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan>Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0574/index.html
2012,Motion-related brain activity enhanced by motion representation during metaphor understanding,"Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested the involvement of motor-related brain regions during semantic processing of action-related idioms and fictive motion sentences. However, it remains unclear if such regions are also involved in understanding of metaphorical expressions. Because metaphor understanding requires abstract semantic manipulations and elaborated feature mapping, one possibility remains that it involves more semantic processing implicated in fronto-temporal regions. On the other hand, due to the conspicuous nature of active items, it may enhance representation of motion and actions, resulting in increased activations in motor-related brain regions. The current fMRI study tested these hypotheses by measuring brain activity while participants made semantic judgments about metaphor sentences involving action and motion. The motion metaphor condition, relative to the motor-related but literal condition, showed prominent brain activity in a fronto-motor region near BA 4. This result suggests that understanding of motion-related metaphor induces direct representation of action and motion.",>Naoko Kuriyama>Asuka Terai>Takashi Kusumi>Masanori Nakagawa>Kimihiko Yamagishi>Koji Jimura,>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Kyoto University>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0575/index.html
2012,The influence of redundant and idiosyncratic attributes on coherence within a category and contrast between categories,"Many studies on categorization assume that not only coherence within a category but also contrast between categories is important for categorization. This study used line drawings of fictional insects to examine how redundant and idiosyncratic attributes influence categorization. In this study, these attributes were color attributes (brown or blue) that were added to only one instance for each of two categories during category learning and were mutually different between categories. After category learning, a transfer test involving categorization judgments and confidence ratings for those judgments was conducted. The results suggested that the idiosyncratic color of the own category did not help participants to categorize instances into this category, but the idiosyncratic color of the other category deterred participants from categorizing instances into the own category. These results reveal that categorization involves a complex process of drawing contrasts between categories.",>Ikuko Kyoya>Masaomi Oda,>Ritsumeikan University>Ritsumeikan University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0576/index.html
2012,Assessment and refinement of an intelligent tutor for complex decision making,"We tested the effectiveness of a prototype simulation-based training procedure designed to support decision making in complex dynamic environments. An intelligent tutor was designed to monitor trainees’ use of over-simplifying heuristics throughout three scenarios and to discourage their use in a timely manner. Two test scenarios were used to assess training effectiveness: One involved a transparent problem structure while the other was partly opaque. Results showed a 34% decrease in the average use of the four heuristics monitored. However, goal attainment did not significantly improve in the test scenarios (heuristics were not replaced by better strategies). The training had a positive impact on participants’ ability to anticipate system behavior in the high transparency scenario but a negative impact in the low transparency scenario. We conclude that intelligent tutors should not only detract from using ineffective heuristics but also prescribe effective context relevant heuristics to overcome the “wall of complexity”.",>Daniel Lafond>Sebastien Tremblay>Michel DuCharme>Marie-Ève St-Louis>Jean-François Gagnon,>Defence R&D; Canada>Universite Laval>Defence R&D; Canada>Universite Laval>Universite Laval,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0577/index.html

Results from these experiments indicate that the hypothesis is correct. Each experiment examined the learnability of one of three patterns in phonological, syntactic, non-speech auditory, and visual domains. These patterns are significant in different ways: pattern SH is attested in phonology; pattern FL is unattested in phonology; pattern NE is unattested in phonology, but attested in syntax. Results showed that SH was more readily learnable than FL in the phonological and the non-speech auditory conditions, but not the visual condition. Also, the performance of the phonological group was significantly different from the syntax group when exposed to the NE pattern.",>Regine Lai>Jeffrey Heinz,>University of Delaware>University of Delaware,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0578/index.html
2012,Deceptive strategy choice as decision making under risk,"Verbal deception often involves more subtle forms of deception than simply telling an outright lie. These different forms of deception are associated with different potential costs and benefits and thus constitute strategic choice options. To model this choice process, we treat deceptive strategy selection as decision making under risk; we assume that the speaker knows what gains can result from being deceptive (e.g., personal gain, preventing harm to others), and what she stands to lose if her deception is detected, or what losses would have resulted had she told the truth. We compare the computational model to data from human experiments in which we study whether people making deceptive strategy choices focus on inter-personal and situational factors, rather than on classical economic variables such as magnitudes and probabilities of potential losses and gains.",>Tei Laine>Kayo Sakamoto,>Institute of High Performance Computing>Institute of High Performance Computing,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0579/index.html
2012,Inner Speech and Task Switching in Adults,"The aim of this study was to quantify the role of inner speech in categorical flexibility tasks. Research has shown that the suppression of inner speech in cognitive flexibility tasks leads to poorer performance by subjects. In contrast to previous studies, our objective was to offer tasks that enabled subjects to freely verbalize their reasoning, and to quantify its use. Using surface laryngeal electromyography to measure inner speech signals, we demonstrated that the more difficult the switching task, the greater the quantity of speech recruited by subjects when retaining and applying rules. Furthermore, our results show that relatively older adults (M = 50 years) tend to rely on inner speech more than younger adults (M = 25). We discuss the idea that speech acts as a support to executive functions and that it is needed to a greater extent with age due to declining executive performance.",>Lucie Laurent>Jean-Louis Millot>Patrice Andrieu>Valérie Camos>Caroline Floccia>Fabien Mathy,">MSHE, Besançon, Doubs, France>Laboratoire de Neuroscience, Besançon, Doubs, France>Laboratoire de Neuroscience, Besançon, Doubs, France>Département de psychologie, Université de Fribourg, Switzerland>School of Psychology, Plymouth University, United Kingdom>Université de Franche-comté",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0580/index.html
2012,Enhanced Visual Processing in Perihand Space: Effects of Handedness,"There is a growing body of evidence that visual processing is enhanced in perihand space. Some recent studies also showed that this enhancement is limited to the space around the right hand, at least in right handers. One explanation for these findings is that visual processing is facilitated at locations where action is more likely to occur. To test this notion, we had left and right handers perform a visual discrimination task under four hand-position configurations: Left only, right only, both hands, or no hands near the visual display. Results showed qualitatively different patterns for the two handedness groups. Visual sensitivity (d’) was higher when only the left hand was near the display for left handers, whereas right handers performed better in the right- and both-hands conditions. These findings tend to confirm that visual enhancement is tied to the dominant hand, which is preferentially used for most manual actions.",>Nathalie Le Bigot>Marc Grosjean,">Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors, Dortmund, Germany>Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors, Dortmund, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0581/index.html

It was hypothesized that the former pays more attention to the targets than the grounds, whereas the latter pays attention to the relation between the targets and the grounds as well as the targets themselves in the scene perception. In Experiment 1 where Korean individualists were contrasted with Korean collectivists, cultural disposition (individualism vs. collectivism), figure-ground relevance (naturalness vs. unnaturalness), and change of scene(no change vs. change of figures vs. change of grounds) were manipulated. The results of Experiment 1 showed that the collectivists respond to the unnatural scenes more sensitively than the individualists. The similar patterns were observed in Experiment 2 in which Korean as collectivists and European American as individualists were contrasted with each other. In sum, these results suggest that the collectivists who tend to see the scenes holistically respond to the unnatural scenes more sensitively than the individualists.",>Yoonkyoung Lee>Bia Kim>Yiwon Hyun>Cheonwoo Shin>Jaesik Lee>HyunJung Shin,>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University>Pusan National University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0582/index.html

2012,How they pick out the answer in multiple choice questionnaire: Independent-self versus interdependent-self,"Attentiveness to others is more likely to be a self-defining goal when the self is thought of as interdependent with others rather than independent of others. We predicted that interdependent – self is more attentive in common ground than independent – self in multiple choice questionnaire. In experiment 1, participants’ temporary self-construal was manipulated thought a priming technique. As predicted, interdependence-primed participants were more likely than independence-primed participants to take the recipients’ knowledge into account and avoided providing redundant information in a self-administered questionnaire. Drawing on chronic differences in self-construal, experiment 2, replicated these findings with participants from independent and interdependent selves. The implications of these results for increasing understanding of behavioral priming effects in rich social contexts are discussed.

2012,"Information Structure, Alternatives, and Scalar Implicatures","Discourse occurs for information exchange in sentential utterances with information structure (IS). IS needs notions of Topic and Focus, Contrastive Topic (CT) and Contrastive Focus (CF). CT and CF are characterized in question answer conversation. A CT utterance comes from a QUD (Roberts 1996) with a Potential Topic (PT) consisting of a set of relevant alternative members, as a partial answer. Naturally, the question is not completely resolved and invokes a conventional scalar implicature. It is marked by a special intonation or morphemic marker and its implicature is not cancellable, hence conventional. The implicature generated is scalar with respect to the totality or qualitatively, in its DP or predicate PT. CF is argued to invoke a closed set of disjunctive alternative possibilities. An alternative question is licensed if a pair or more of immediately relevant alternatives are available in the discourse context, as in “Will you drink a tea↑ or a coffee↓?” It is semantically strengthened by the restriction “exactly one disjunct holds” (Pruitt & Roelofsen’s 2011) as in Inquisitive Semantics (InqSem). A correction answer is a typical CF: (1) Sue married Sam? Covertly, (2) Did SUECF marry Sam↑ or did RITACF marry Sam↓? (From the immediately relevant alternatives set: {Sue married Sam, Rita married Sam}) (3) No, RITACF married Sam. All CF instances including pseudo-clefts, exhaustive focus, and CF-reduplication have (covert) AltQ. CF and AltQ in disjunction are likewise correlated. A conjunctively conceived CT is distinct from CF, conveying a scalar implicature, due to the unresolved partial information. CF and CT information structure is cognitively real.

2012,Observational category learning increases sensitivity to prototypical and correlational information,"The traditional laboratory task of supervised classification learning tends to produce sensitivity only to information that discriminates between competing categories. Recent research broadening the study of category learning (e.g., inference learning) suggests that learners can be sensitive to structure beyond what is diagnostic. In previous work we interpreted these findings to reflect a generative (as opposed to discriminative) mode of learning and extended the phenomena to supervised observational learning of categories varying along two continuous dimensions. We now aim to demonstrate generative observational learning using binary dimensions. Categories were based on a uni-dimensional rule with within-category regularities in the form of a family resemblance structure (Experiment 1) or a perfect correlation between features (Experiment 2). Compared to classification learners, observation learners showed greater knowledge of both types of non-diagnostic structure. These results hold implications for how categories are learned and present a challenge to models grounded in discriminative category learning.",>Kimery Levering>Kenneth Kurtz,>SUNY Binghamton>SUNY Binghamton,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0586/index.html

However, after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, Twitter users transmitted rumors about radiation and supplies, which caused unnecessary panic. In the current work, we examined the thinking behind the decision to spread disaster-related tweets in Twitter. We showed subjects tweets related to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. For each tweet, we asked them whether or not they would retweet it and the reason for their retweeting decision. Whereas thought of others (e.g., informative to others) played a major role when they decided to retweet, consideration of self (e.g., not interesting to me) dominated when they decided not to retweet. We further examined how factors such as source, familiarity, and importance of disaster-related tweets affect the retweeting decisions.

(in press) about constructing a symbolic communication system, it had been confirmed that the emergence process includes three stages corresponding to three test conditions: no messaging, synchronous messaging and asynchronous messaging, respectively. To investigate the mechanism of the emergence of symbolic communication system, an agent-based model is built using reinforcement learning. The simulation result shows that: 1) for synchronous messaging condition, the number of rounds taken to get enough points to win tends to grow when increasing the size of selectable symbols; 2) for asynchronous messaging condition, the number of rounds before success remains stable even though more selectable symbols are offered. We thus conclude that the size of selectable symbols has a negative effect on the formation of symbolic communication system under the synchronous messaging condition, while has no effect under the asynchronous messaging condition.",>Guanhong Li>Takashi Hashimoto,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0588/index.html

One of the reasons is because there is not an established methodological paradigm. A connection between interruption and error detection is proposed – when an error is detected and corrected, it is similar to handling an interruption because the original task has to be suspended and resumed later. The connection is based on Trafton et al.’s (2003) characterisation of interruption, which dissects interrupted activities into various measurable time-based components. A similar anatomy of the error detection process is proposed giving time-based measures such as detection lag, correction lag and resumption lag; error detection examples are discussed. The main contribution of the proposed characterisation is a methodological one – postulating a set of dependent measures for future systematic investigations of the error detection process.",>Simon Y.

2012,Cross-linguistic Similarities and Differences in Causative Constructions,"Language is learned on the basis of input and general cognitive mechanisms. We present a study on causative constructions in English, Korean and Portuguese. Causative constructions vary cross-linguistically, but we show that there is a possibility of some cross-linguistic generalizations among causative constructions in the three languages. We also point out some of the idiosyncratic constructions in each language, for example, the caused-motion construction in English. First, we divide causative constructions into three types: causation by command, causation by direct physical action and causation of emotion.

2012,Unpredictable Grunting in Tennis is More Distracting,"Anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests that grunting in tennis can hinder an opponent’s performance. Here we addressed the question of whether a grunt is solely a distraction, or if instead it masks important auditory information carried by the dynamic multisensory event of the ball striking the racquet. Videos of a professional tennis player were played in silence, or included a grunt either before, during, or after impact, with the task being to judge the direction of the shot as quickly and accurately as possible. No differences were observed between the sound conditions, indicating that the adverse effects of grunting may be related to general distraction. This was replicated when manipulating the frequency of the grunts to occur 75% of the time, with overall performance improving, suggesting that the predictability of grunts is important, with more sporadic grunting leading to diminished performance.",>Ahnate Lim>Alan Kingstone>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of British Columbia>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0592/index.html

This study explores dimensions beneath “critical thinking” and factors that would have contributed towards this goal, based on student evaluations gathered from a range of undergraduate modules taught by the author.

2012,Is it Possible to Train the Approximate Number System?,"Humans are believed to be equipped with an Approximate Number System (ANS) that supports non-symbolic representations of numerical magnitudes. Acuity in the ANS is thought to progress developmentally from childhood to adolescence and to be related to mathematical achievement. However, from previous research, it is not clear whether it is possible to train this core ability. The present study investigates the effect of substantive corrective feedback on non-symbolic number comparisons, in an adult population, using a control group comparison design. The results indicate that even extensive training with feedback (1000 trials) has no effect on ANS-acuity. However, feedback induces a motivational effect on participants. These results suggest that some of the observed relationship between ANS-acuity and general math achievement may be mediated by a motivational factor and that a characteristic of the number sense may be its non-plasticity, at least for adults.",>Marcus Lindskog>Anders Winman>Peter Juslin,">Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden>Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden>Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0594/index.html

This ""cognitive choreography"" was investigated previously in an attempt to tie cognitive functions to regional brain activity. The task used was a complex mental algebra task involving the combined use of various cognitive functions: problem representation, mental manipulation, memory retrieval, maintenance, and goal changing, as well as multiple modalities for input (auditory and visual) and output (manual and verbal).

Thirty-one undergraduate subjects participated in the experiment in which they were asked to solve a task individually regarding the requirements for causing landslides. Participants’ visual attention distribution were measured with an eye-tracker. Students’ online searching strategies were assessed via a online information searching strategy inventory immediately after the online searching task. Results of this study revealed that students with higher prior knowledge can better identify relevant information from websites. And students with better problem-solving performance were found to spend more time reading relevant online information. In addition, students with better evaluation strategy were found to integrate the relevant information more efficiently. Furthermore, a significant gender difference was found in their visual attention allocated on the task problem and on the first page of search results.",>Wan-Yi Liu>Meng-Jung Tsai,">Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology>Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0596/index.html
2012,Action and affordances in nominal classifier systems,"Although interdisciplinary research is increasingly being conducted on language and action within cognitive neuroscience, no one has looked into how the typological study of grammatical categories can be explained in terms of sensorimotor interactional learning. In this presentation cognitive semantic bases of nominal classifier systems are analysed in the light of the latest neuroscientific research within embodied cognition. Classifiers are found in unrelated languages in disparate areas of the world and are based on a restricted set of recurring semantic domains, e.g. an object’s size, material, consistency, shape, dimension, inherent orientation, or function values. They therefore represent a justified area of study for general human cognition. It is demonstrated that embodied knowledge is necessary in order to use these grammatical components correctly in communication, relying on situatedness and perception in the conceptualisation process. Hypotheses of neural activation sites are proposed that accord with their modes of acquisition.",>Marit Lobben,>University of Oslo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0597/index.html
2012,An ERP study on L2 grammatical aspect processing in Japanese,"Second language learners process aspectual mismatch between verbs and adverbs differently from native speakers (Long et al., in press). Then, what about mismatch between grammatical aspect and adverbs? We explore into this question using event-related potentials (ERP), and compare our results with aspectual mismatch study with L1 Chinese speakers reported by Zhang & Zhang (2008). Eleven Chinese speakers with high Japanese proficiency read Japanese sentences where aspectual property of adverbs either matched or mismatched with the progressive aspectual marker. Brain responses to mismatch were recorded by ERP. Our results showed that violations of grammatical aspect elicited a 300-500ms posterior and left central negativity, which reflect resolving incompatibility of aspectual markers. This negativity is similar in its timing and distribution to the negativity reported in Zhang & Zhang (2008) for native speakers. This suggests that Chinese learners of Japanese process grammatical aspect as they do in their native language.",>Shengyan Long>Yusaku Tsuyuguchi>Manami Sato>Hiromu Sakai,>Hiroshima University>Hiroshima University>Hiroshima University>Hiroshima University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0598/index.html

This study investigates the role of embodiment on children’s memory recall. Participants were fifth graders from two urban public schools attending a Robotics after-school program. They were asked to recall different LEGO Mindstorms sensors they used when constructing their robots and which of the physical science concepts were presented. Students were randomly assigned to one of the two learning conditions: science learning with robotics or science learning with robotics and embodiment. Students in embodied group outperformed the students in the robotics group. The results suggest that embodiment has remarkable potential to enhance children’s memory recall and performance on recognition tests, as compared to children without the embodied experience.",>Carol M.

2012,Social elements are not a must for preverbal infants’ learning in an interactive event,"Hamlin et al. (2007, 2010, 2011) showed that preverbal infants exhibit preference for animated figures in social events, and Chow, Tsui & Tseng (2011) demonstrated that infants can successfully associate visual (e.g. shape, color, and motion) cues with emotional cues (e.g. crying and laughing) which could be a prerequisite for making this social judgment. The current study examined whether infants’ ability of associated learning in complex sequences is limited to social-related situations only. After removing all socially relevant cues (eyes, facial expression, crying or laughing) from learning stimuli, we found 8 to 10-month-old infants could still associate agents with motion and neutral auditory outcomes. We also found the shape/color of a figure to be a more salient factor than the movement of the figure. We conclude that associated learning in animated interaction is not limited to specific social contexts in preverbal infants.",>Yuen Ki Ma>Hiu-Mei Chow>Jaclyn Yeung>Anna Wing Yee Ho>Chia-Huei Tseng,">Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0600/index.html
2012,A possible source of phonological deficit in developmental dyslexia: Counter-evidence for universal phonological grammar,"Whether the phonological deficit in dyslexia ensues from impaired universal phonological grammar remains unanswered. Ten French dyslexic children were compared to chronological age-matched and reading level-matched controls. All were aurally-administered two syllable-counting tasks with di- and trisyllabic pseudowords (/am.ʒal/; Exp. 1) or mono- and disyllabic pseudowords (/mʒal/; Exp. 2). We manipulated universal phonological sonority-related markedness within unattested onset clusters, from the phonotactically-unmarked clusters (/bʁal/) to the phonotactically-marked ones (/ʁbal/). Sonority-related markedness was “naturally” inverted within intervocalic clusters. Across experiments, as sonority-related markedness decreased, response accuracy increased. Response patterns were similar in dyslexic children who were as accurate as both control groups, but systematically slower. Remarkably, an illusory epenthetic /ə/ vowel phonologically repaired marked clusters. Neither statistical properties nor acoustic-phonetic cues and reading skills accounted for the misperception/repair. Our results discard impaired phonological grammar as a source of dyslexics' phonological deficit and are discussed toward a deviant vs. delayed developmental course.",>Norbert Maïonchi-Pino>Yasuyuki Taki>Satoru Yokoyama>Kei Takahashi>Annie Magnan>Hiroshi Hashizume>Jean Écalle>Ryuta Kawashima,">Dept. of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, IDAC, Tohoku University - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science>Dept. of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, IDAC, Tohoku University>Dept. of Functional Brain Imaging, IDAC, Tohoku University>Dept. of Functional Brain Imaging, IDAC, Tohoku University>Laboratoire d’Étude des Mécanismes Cognitifs, Université Lumière Lyon 2 - Institut Universitaire de France>Dept. of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, IDAC, Tohoku University>Laboratoire d’Étude des Mécanismes Cognitifs, Université Lumière Lyon 2>Dept. of Functional Brain Imaging, IDAC, Tohoku University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0601/index.html
2012,Aberrant sense of agency in patients with schizophrenia:confusion of temporal causality during intentional action,"Self-disturbances in schizophrenia have been explained and studied from the standpoint of an abnormal sense of agency (SoA). We devised an original agency attribution task that evaluated explicit experiences of temporal causal relation between an intentional action and an external event, without any confounding from sense of body ownership. We demonstrated that an excessive SoA was observed in patients with prominent positive symptoms including delusion and hallucination. Moreover, those patients had a greater tendency to feel SoA even when external events were programmed to precede their action (“backward causation”). Therefore, patients felt both forward and backward exaggerated causal efficacy during the intentional action (Maeda et al., Psychiatry Research2012). On the other hand, patients with predominant negative symptoms showed diminished SoA. Confusion in the experience of temporal causal relations between the self and the external world may underlie self-disturbances in schizophrenia. Aberrant SoA could be a fundamental vulnerability marker for schizophrenia.",>Takaki Maeda>Motoichiro Kato>Keisuke Takahata>Tsukasa Okimura>Hajime Asama>Masaru Mimura,">Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine>Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine>Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine>Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine>Tokyo University>Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0602/index.html

Focus group interviews were conducted with undergraduate students from Kyoto (n = 8) and Okinawa (n = 7) in Japan, and from Auckland (n = 8) in New Zealand. Analysis of the students’ responses revealed commonalities in views about what “good thinkers” possess: these included many qualities associated with critical thinking. However, when specifically asked about the meaning of “critical thinking”, many of the students from Okinawa were uncertain, and the students from Auckland also referred to attributes not commonly associated with critical thinking such as intuition and positive thinking. The results suggest a need for more explicit instruction in critical thinking skills development as well as for greater clarity about thinking skills expectations in tertiary level courses.",>Emmanuel Manalo>Takashi Kusumi>Masuo Koyasu>Yasushi Michita>Yuko Tanaka,>Waseda University>Kyoto University>Kyoto University>The University of the Ryukyus>Stevens Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0603/index.html
2012,The role of exploratory decision-making in enhancing episodic memory,"Studies of episodic memory are typically passive in that the learner can’t control the sequence and timing of stimulus presentation. This approach obscures how people alter their learning by choosing to study some items over others, a decision-making process with many implications for memory. Voss (2011) showed that when people made decisions about what to study their memory was better than when “yoked” to the decisions of another person, and they derived a specific benefit from revisiting recent items. The source of this benefit is unclear, however, since previous studies have not separated the effect of executing study decisions from that of resulting “personalized” study opportunities. By varying the decision-maker’s degree of control over the study experience, we show that people still benefit from making study decisions even when unable to revisit items or choose what material to study next, highlighting the role of decision-related processes in improving episodic encoding.",>Doug Markant>Sarah Dubrow>Lila Davachi>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0604/index.html

While the majority of these findings have incorporated traditional neuropsychological tests (e.g., California Verbal Learning Test, Trail-Making), very little work has investigated visual temporal processing, and how spatial attention is distributed, and potentially adversely affected, by HIV infection. In this preliminary study we used a temporal order judgment task that required participants to accurately judge the successiveness of laterally presented asynchronous events. Attention was spatially directed by a peripheral cue prior to each trial, in order to assess deficits in orientation to reflexive cues. The findings demonstrated that people with HIV required more time to accurately judge temporal order when compared with a sample without HIV. However, the cue captured attention equally regardless of HIV status. The broader conclusion is that HIV may lead to impairment in visual temporal processing, without adverse effects on the distribution of spatial attention.",>Liron Marotz>Scott Sinnett>Cecilia M.

2012,Increases in Children’s Semantic Organization Predict Category-based Reasoning,"Prior research indicates a protracted developmental course in inductive reasoning based on category information (Fisher, Matlen, & Godwin, 2011). A possible explanation for the development of adult-like induction is the gradual reorganization of semantic-knowledge. To explore this possibility, we presented preschoolers (N=43), kindergarteners (N=22), first-graders (N=10) and adults (N=20) with blocks representing semantically-similar (e.g., chick-hen), physically-similar (e.g., lamb-swan) and same-habitat (e.g., whale-octopus) animals: Participants placed animal pairs on a board representing a zoo according to the degree of semantic-similarity. The distance between animals was taken as a measure of how closely participants represented the semantic concepts. Preschoolers exhibited considerable variability and were worse at discriminating between semantically-similar and non-semantically-similar dyads compared to older children and adults. Preschoolers’ scores on the semantic-space task were also correlated with performance on an induction task (r=0.46; p=0.002). These results are consistent with the possibility that the organization of semantic-knowledge underlies advances in category-based reasoning.",>Bryan Matlen>Karrie Godwin>Anna Fisher,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0607/index.html
2012,Efficiency of the Cognitive Bias in Grammar Acquisition,"This study investigates efficacy of cognitive biases for grammar acquisition. We present a simulation of virtual block world where a pair of a parent and an infant agent resides. When a parent takes an action and utters corresponding sentence, an infant guesses the meaning of the utterance from the situational change caused by the action. The infant tries to acquire a compositional grammar through an amount of utterances, and the grammar would be polished through generations. Through this process, we focus on how the symmetry and mutual exclusivity biases help this grammar refinement. We expect that the symmetry bias works to combine a situational change and an utterance, and that the mutual exclusivity bias contributes to solve the ambiguity between a situational change and an action; when the infant finds an utterance is already combined with a different meaning, he/she ignores the new pair of utterance/meaning by the latter bias.",>Ryuichi Matoba>Makoto Nakamura>Shingo Hagiwara>Satoshi Tojo,>Toyama National College of Technology>Nagoya University>Toyama National College of Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0608/index.html
2012,CyclingMusic & CyclingMelody: A System for Enriching Scenery Experience in Cycling by Real-Time Synaesthetic Sonification of Passing Landscape,"When riding on a bicycle, many people enjoy looking over the landscape passing by. This study discusses how to enrich scenery experience in cycling. Since the scenery experience is based on an embodied perception, it is known as one of the tacit knowledge, thus enriching it is difficult. In order to overcome this problem, we focused on the feature of auditory sense. Human audition can accommodate dynamic information better than vision, and data sonification presumably represents time-series data more efficiently than data visualization. We constructed two systems named “CyclingMusic” and “CyclingMelody” that translate the perceived movement of the scenery and other visual impressions, such as hue, lightness and colorfulness, into music. The continuously changing view is captured with a web-cam and translated into MIDI events that are replayed instantaneously. This allows for a reflection of the visual impression, adding a sound dimension to the visual experience and deepening the state of perception. A practical experiment in cycling shows sonification makes participants deepen the spatial experience.",>Masaki Matsubara>Satoshi Kuribayashi>Haruka Nukariya>Yasuaki Kakehi,">University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan>Keio Research Institute at SFC, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan>Keio University, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan>Keio University, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0609/index.html
2012,Does a humanoid robot in front of you activate your mirror neuron system?,"In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the human-likeness of a humanoid robot named Robovie by using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Since the activity of the human mirror neuron system (MNS) is believed to reflect the perceived human-likeness of observed agents, we compared MNS activity during observations of an action performed by a human and Robovie. Seven males and ten females participated. There were four observation conditions such as live-human, live-robot, video-human and video-robot. In addition the participants executed the same action by their selves to confirm the location of motor-related brain areas. MNS activity was the largest in the live-human condition in line with previous studies. Our interesting finding was, however, that MNS activity was larger in the live-robot condition than the video-human condition. This suggests that we perceive a humanoid robot in front of us as a more human-like being than a videotaped human.",>Goh Matsuda>Kazuo Hiraki>Hiroshi Ishiguro,>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo>Osaka University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0610/index.html

The result shows that, in judgments about preference, familiarity, and nostalgia, scores for the stimuli in homogenous exposure condition rose after 1 week, although scores in heterogenous exposure condition didn’t change with a delay. In homogenous and high frequent presentation, nostalgia occurred by an interval of one week, and that nostalgia raised stimuli’s preference and familiarity.",>Ken Matsuda>Eriko Sugimori>Takashi Kusumi,>Yamaguchi University>Yale University>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0611/index.html
2012,The Computational Process of “And-type” Conditionals in Japanese,"Japanese has four types of conditional sentences: “Nara-type”, “Reba-type”, “Tara-type” and the natural consequence expression using “To (And-type).” Among these four types, only And-type conditionals cannot express counterfactuals. Masuoka (1993) says that the Japanese conjunction “To (And)” is an index which calculates the relevance between elements. This paper explains this phenomenon based on Relevance Theory (Sperber et al. 1986). Cognitive relevance between the information A and B is defined by correlation coefficient (CR1) or by Loose Symmetry Model (CR2, Shinohara and Nakano, 2007). (1) CR1=P(AB)/P(A)−k∙P(aB)/P(a) (2) CR2=(P(AB)+P(Ab)∙P(ab)/P(b))/(P(AB)+P(Ab)+P(AB)∙P(aB)/P(B)+P(Ab)∙P(ab)/P(b)) In the expression of counterfactuals, the relation P(a)=P(ab)+P(ab)=0 is trivial. Thefore, CR1 is computable only when the coefficient “k” which means the frame range of anti-factual situation equals zero. This computation leads the result of impossibility of And-type counterfactuals. On the other hand, CR2 cannot explain this impossibility because CR2 is always infinite. Therefore, CR1 is the better definition than CR2.",>Michinao Matsui,">Osaka Health Science University, 1-9-27, Temma, Kita-ku, Osaka-Shi, Osaka, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0612/index.html
2012,Connecting input filtering and selection in language evolution,"Previous work has demonstrated the formal equivalence of simple models of cultural evolution, based on iterated Bayesian learning with symmetric Dirichlet priors, with neutral models of biological evolution. This demonstration was profitable in allowing the use of existing mathematical results from population genetics to be applied to questions of language change. We extend this work by exploring parallels between more complicated models of cultural evolution, featuring “input filtering”, and models of biological evolution with selection. We investigate the use of analytic expressions for steady-state distributions for predicting the outcomes of cultural learning models, and apply these methods to the explanation of historical word order change via input filtering. In addition to these practical outcomes, our work relates to the broader question of just how similar linguistic and other cultural change is to Darwinian evolution in biology, and how valid it is to speak of cultural traits being “selected for”.",>Luke Maurits>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0613/index.html
2012,When Lexical Development does not Spurt; the Case of Williams Syndrome Children,"Williams Syndrome (WS) children possess relatively large vocabularies when compared to their other, impaired, cognitive skills. However, their language acquisition is delayed, their vocabulary does not spurt, categorisation skills are weak and they do not respond taxonomically. We mimic WS categorization impairments by hindering the formation of visual categories in a model of early word learning (Mayor & Plunkett, 2010). In the absence of lesions, the model accounts for the emergence of taxonomic responding and displays a vocabulary spurt driven by the formation of categorical representations. In contrast, when categorisation is impaired, lexical acquisition is delayed, a vocabulary spurt is absent and word-object associations are not generalised. However, through repetitive labelling events, the system is still able to acquire a large ""proto-lexicon"" by gradually attaching several exemplars of a category to their appropriate sound pattern in an associationist mechanism, thereby leading to the formation of a surprisingly large vocabulary.",>Julien Mayor,">University of Geneva, Genève, Switzerland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0614/index.html
2012,Self-directed information selection aids learning of logical rules,"In self-directed learning tasks, participants can control the sequencing and timing of information presentation. In contrast, the existing literature on category learning has focused on passive learning paradigms, wherein information is presented to the learner randomly or in a pattern determined in advance by the experimenter. To explore the impact of self-directed learning on categorization performance, we compared passive and self-directed learning in the seminal Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961) category learning tasks. Participants learned by actively querying the category membership of individual exemplars in an array or by passively viewing labeled examples. We found that active learners exhibited significantly faster learning than passive learners. In addition, the benefits of self-directed learning were not uniform, but varied as a function of the category structure. Our results suggest that differences in interaction with learning materials can alter the difficulty of learning problems, independent of the abstract structure of the underlying rule.",>John V.

2012,Making and breaking procedural conventions in dialogue,"A key problem for models of dialogue is to explain how co-ordination is established and sustained. Existing accounts emphasize the importance of interaction, demonstrating how collaborative feedback leads to more systematized, stable, arbitrary and partner-specific referring conventions. However, in addition to conventionalizing referring expressions, recent work demonstrates how interlocutors also rapidly establish procedural conventions for resolving sequential and temporal co-ordination problems in the interaction. It is unclear, however, whether interlocutors associate these procedural conventions with specific conversational partners. To address this question, we report a collaborative, 3-participant, computer-mediated task which presents participants with the recurrent co-ordination problem of ordering their actions and utterances into a single sequence. Artificially generated clarification requests are inserted into the dialogue, that appear, to each participant, as if they originate from either of the 2 other participants. We argue that participants' responses to these clarifications provide evidence of interlocutors associating procedural conventions with specific partners.",>Gregory Mills,>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0616/index.html

The effect has been recognized widely experientially at schools and museums, yet the cognitive mechanisms of this facilitation have not been fully investigated. In this study we have used a remotely operated robot to provide a group of 10 to 15 kids of 8 to 10 year olds with a perspective not shared by them, to see whether such intervention could expand the group’s scope of appreciation. The robot was accepted as a “friend” with its own ideas, and we identified cases of such facilitation.

2012,The effect of harmonization between word meaning and typography impression on implicit memory,"This study examined the effect of harmonization between word meaning and typography impression on implicit memory. In a preliminary experiment, we asked undergraduate students the degree of harmonization (“how much does the typography match its word meaning?”) for 153 words, showing them two lists (hiragana and kanji) with three different typographies. Based on the results, an incidental memory experiment was executed with three experimental factors: the scripts at learning (hiragana, kanji, or no learning), with/without the harmonization at learning, and the typography at testing (same as learning, different neutral typography), as within participant factors. Both a word completion task and an old/new recognition test were executed using only hiragana. The result showed that harmonization facilitated implicit memory with hiragana-learned words, but implicit memory was reduced for kanji-learned words. Morphologically-based processing occurred when word meaning and typography were harmonized. Conceptual implication of this harmonization effect will be discussed.",>Kozue Miyashiro>Etsuko T.

2012,Short-term memory for tonal and verbal information: Comparison with absolute and non-absolute pitch possessors,"This study examined the difference in the storage of pitch and phonological information in absolute pitch (AP) and non-AP (NAP) possessors. In a recognition task using musical tones (pitch information), speech sounds (phonological information), and visual patterns, participants were asked to retain two stimulus sequences. In the same type condition, the nature of the first and second stimulus set was different (e.g., one sequence was musical tones and the other was speech sounds). In the different type condition, the nature of the two sequences was the same (e.g., both sequences were musical tones). We found that, in NAP possessors, the recognition rate of musical tones and speech sounds in the different type condition was higher than in the same type condition. In AP possessors, however, the recognition rate of musical tones revealed no difference between these two conditions. These results suggest the use of different strategy in retaining musical tones between AP and NAP possessors.",>Shiho Miyazawa>Akihiro Tanaka>Takehiko Nishimoto,>Tokyo Woman's Christian University>Tokyo Woman's Christian University>Waseda University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0619/index.html
2012,Behavioral priming contributes to the subsequent recognition performance,"The present study assessed the impact of behavioral priming in several tasks (semantic, color-decision and phonological tasks) on the creation of new explicit memory. In this study, Japanese words written in Kanji were repeated once in an incidental encoding task and explicit memory for the words was unexpectedly tested afterwards. The words associated with more behavioral priming in the semantic task were better recognized in the subsequent explicit memory test than were the words with less priming. Moreover, the subjects who demonstrated greater priming in the semantic task performed better in the explicit memory test. These results suggest that behavioral priming enhances the creation of explicit memory.",>Kiyohumi Miyoshi>Hiroshi Ashida,>Kyoto University>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0620/index.html
2012,How much do you trust me? Economic decision-making and ingroup and outgroup membership,"Cross-cultural studies suggest that culture can influence human decision making, especially in economic contexts, but little is known about economic decision-making comparing ingroup and outgroup membership. We studied trusting behavior in two different cultures: the Chinese one, example of collectivist culture, and the Italian one, example of individualistic culture (N=25 Italians and N=25 Chinese). Using a modified version of the Trust Game with tree level of trust (20 o 40 o 60 Monetary Units), we investigated behavioral differences in decision-making based on trust levels in ingroup (Player A and B same nationality),and outgroup condition (Player A and B different nationality). Data analysis showed that both groups tend to trust more when the amount of monetary units decreases. Furthermore, results revealed no statistically significant differences in the trusting behavior between ingroup and outgroup factor for both cultural groups.",>Rosalba Morese>Daniela Rabellino>Angela Ciaramidaro>Marco R.

2012,Using syntactic priming to facilitate the language production of novice Japanese EFL learners,"Syntactic priming is the tendency for language users to produce a particular syntactic structure soon after listening to or reading that structure. Previous research using Japanese EFL learners found that intermediate learners were affected significantly more by syntactic priming than novice learners in a sentence completion task mainly because the grammatical/syntactic information might not be fully represented in the mental lexicon of the latter (Morishita, 2011; Morishita, Satoi, & Yokokawa, 2010). Morishita and Yokokawa (2011) found, however, that the more novice learners were exposed to certain sentence structures, the stronger the priming effects became, where repeated exposure might aid implicit learning through imitation and practice. This presentation will discuss the results of the above research, as well as those of an ongoing experiment based on a scripted interaction task, in order to assess the possibility of using syntactic priming to facilitate the language production of novice Japanese EFL learners.",>Miwa Morishita,>Kobe Gakuin University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0622/index.html
2012,Speed reading training and visual span,"The current study investigated the span training effect on size of visual span and on reading speed. The visual span for reading refers to the range of letters, formatted as in text, that can be recognized reliably without moving the eyes. It has been hypothesized that the size of the visual span imposes a fundamental limit on reading speed. However, the relation between visual span expansion and reading speed increase has not been clarified. The present study conducted two types of training: One was the word recognition training. Eight undergraduate students were trained to recognize three or four words simultaneously. The other was the saccade training. Ten students were trained to read texts with larger saccades. The results showed that participants’ reading speed increased by 30% in both training groups. The word recognition training was more effective than the saccade training on visual span expansion, especially on left visual field.",>Aiko Morita,">Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0623/index.html
2012,Analytical method of Japanese folk tale for story generation,"The purpose of this research is to examine whether a new story can be created by analysing folk tales. The tools of folklore like the tale type and the motif indexes are used for the analysis. The original text of this research is ""Momotaro"" (Peach Boy). This story had taken a rejuvenation motif until Edo period (19C). I examine 4 factors converted from the rejuvenation to the abnormal birth motif: 1)Prosperity of popular literature, 2)Enactment of elementary school textbook, 3)Diversion of folklore to nationalism, 4)Fight uplift animation in World War II. Next, I show the structure of the story from the following points. {Process of the birth}, {Hero's name}, {Attendants}, {Motivation of departure}, {Strategy of demon extermination}, {Return to home}. I clarified how this story was influenced from the society. Then, I examine to generate the text by analyzing ""Momotaro"", and compared with the Japanese 5 great folk tales.",>Hitoshi Morita,">University of Nagasaki, Nagayo-cho, Nagasaki Pref., Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0624/index.html
2012,Facilitation and inhibition in the spatiotemporal template for detecting target ring,"Using the classification image technique (Ahumada, 1996), this study investigated the nature of spatiotemporal facilitatory and inhibitory templates when detecting a target ring. The stimulus consisted of fifteen temporal frames of five spatial elements: one-center disk and four-surrounding concentric rings. When a target was present, the middle brighter ring than the screen background always served as the target, and the rest of the elements were darker than the background. Random luminance noises were changed on every stimulus frame. On a non-target trial the non-target pattern was presented across all 15 frames. On a target trial the target pattern was presented at the middle three temporal frames. Results showed a transient facilitatory response at the target location around the target presentation and an inhibitory response from the outer elements even after the target’s actual presentation. These results suggest that spatiotemporal templates are not simple copies of the spatiotemporal target pattern.",>Masayoshi Nagai>Patrick J. Bennett>Allison B.

2012,Analysis method focusing on repeated and not repeated verbalizations during human interface operation,"Humans interact with and operate different devices and ultimately form impressions, such as like and dislike. In previous research, humans’ impressions of devices with regard to various operations, were not considered. Human impressions are difficult to capture, as they tend to be ambivalent. This study investigates an analysis method that focuses on repeated and not repeated verbalizations during human interface operation. The study included an experiment in which six subjects were asked to freely verbalize their impressions of device operation of two devices in two vehicles. The words from the verbal protocols are analyzed using concept networks that are formed of associative word pairs. This analysis outlines a complex associative layer of impressions that the verbalizations are drawn from. The result suggests that the impressions from both verbalization types—repeated and not repeated—identify undefined issues in the operation of interfaces. Thus, methods for resolving these issues can be formulated.",>Yukari Nagai>Saori Noda>Georgi V.

2012,The effects of listener’s familiarity with a talker’s voice on the speech recognition in noisy condition,"The present study examined whether listener's familiarity with a talker's voice improved speech recognition in noisy condition. Subjects were asked to perform word and sentence intelligibility task in noisy condition under following three conditions; (1)subjects heard familiar voice and were informed who was speaking (explicit-familiar condition), (2)subjects could hear familiar voice but were not informed who was speaking (implicit-familiar condition), (3)subjects heard unfamiliar voice and were not informed who was speaking (novel condition). We used subject's friend's voice as a familiar voice. As a result, the percentage of correct answer of explicit-familiar condition and implicit-familiar condition were better than that of novel condition, but there was no significant difference between explicit-familiar condition and implicit-familiar condition. Present results revealed that the familiarity with a talker's voice improved speech recognition in noisy condition, while knowing who was speaking did not influence speech recognition.",>Chikako Nagaoka>Naoshi Hiraoka>Shintaro Funahashi,">Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto university, Kyoto, Japan>Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto university, Kyoto, Japan>Kokoro research center, Kyoto university, Kyoto, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0627/index.html
2012,"A Comparison of Experienced, Novice Counselor and Non-counselor in Recall of Client-Presented Information in Therapeutic Interview","This study examines whether counselors’ memory of client-presented information varies qualitatively according to the number of years of counseling experience. This study develops a methodology to measure the amount of counselors’ recall memory obtained from a free recall task after watching videotaped stimulus interviews. Four experienced counselors, seven novice counselors, and twelve non-counselors watched videotaped stimulus interviews and then wrote freely everything they could recall about what the client had said in the interview. Interview transcripts were employed as evaluation criteria. Independent coders judged the parts of the transcript to which the recalled items corresponded. The results indicate that the experienced counselor group scored the highest in recalling client-presented information and that recalled contents differed among the participant groups. Implications of the steps to gain counselor expertise are discussed.

2012,The Narrative Structure of Nostalgia Cognition and Film,"This study inspects re-defining nostalgia and re-modeling the narrative structure of nostalgia cognition. To re-define nostalgia, we use mainly three kinds of nostalgia by Davis (1979), which consists of “simple nostalgia” “reflexive nostalgia” and “interpreted nostalgia.” The narrative structure of re-defined nostalgia cognition is consisted with the three kinds of nostalgia. The re-defined nostalgia includes not only affirmative but also negative factor. This study includes analyzing of films and experiments, which are investigating whether the three kinds of nostalgia is cognized by using the programmed materials. The materials are able to change the past and current scenes of films controlled by the computer programming. These analysis of films and experimental results suggest that some films can enable a viewer experience various kinds of nostalgia. On the other hand, other films can enable a viewer experience only a factor of nostalgia or not at all.",>Yuya Naito>Akihito Kanai,>HOSEI University Graduate School>HOSEI University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0629/index.html
2012,TCieX: An Approach toward Communicating Weight through Pseudo-Haptic Feedback Mechanisms,"The notion of weight is useful to represent not only the mass of an object, but also the physical feedback for a remote interaction as well as the importance of a concept. Existing human-computer interaction design has communicated weight primarily through the three means: symbolic representation (""240g""), kinesthetic interaction (by wearing a physical actuator), and haptic feedback (by applying low-frequency stimuli to the forearm). Our approach uses a fourth means that uses the visual and audio interaction to communicate weight, stiffness, or viscosity through pseudo-haptic feedback mechanisms. Pseudo-haptic feedback stimulates haptic sensations without using a haptic interface but using dynamically changing visual and audio representations in terms of the hand movement. We have built TCieX (Touch-Centric interaction embodiment eXploratorium) as a collection of interaction test suites, with which a user produces a variety of combinations of temporal, visual, and auditory representations for different types of simple object movement through different C/D (Control/Display) ratios and mapping profiles. By using TCieX, an interaction designer explores a design space of visual and auditory representations to produce a desired effect of pseudo-haptic sensations.",>Kumiyo Nakakoji>Yasuhiro Yamamoto,">Software Research Associates, Inc., Japan>Tokyo Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0630/index.html
2012,The effects of paralinguistic cues in a teacher’s responses to the students’ utterances in a moral class,"This study investigated the characteristics of a teacher’s paralinguistic cues in a moral class in a Japanese elementary school. In the class, the children were told a story on friendship and were asked to give their views on it. In the study, the teacher’s responses (in particular, “that’s right,” “I see,” and “great”) to the children’s utterances were analyzed in terms of paralinguistic characteristics. The results show that the response “that’s right” was used fewer times in the learning activities during which the teacher asked the children to think deeply than the other activities. Moreover, during such activities, the teacher’s responses were made with a monotonous intonation and in a relatively low voice. Correspondingly, the children paused more often when giving their views during this activity as compared to the other activities. These results suggest that paralinguistic cues are attached consciously or unconsciously to the teacher’s responses, and they affect the behavior of the children during learning activities.",>Keiko Nakamoto>Ayumi Nishiyama,>Bunkyo University>Bunkyo University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0631/index.html
2012,An agent-based model for the emergence of creoles,"This study investigates the emergence of creoles through computer simulations of language contact in an artificial community. Creoles are full-fledged new languages which infants growing in a multilingual community acquire as their native language. We define a creole in the agent community as a new language dominating the community. We have developed an agent-based model with Kirby (2002)'s Iterative Learning Model where agents are connected with neighbors on a social network. The infant agents acquire a compositional grammar, hearing utterances from their parents and neighbors. Assuming language exposure plays a key role for creolization, we introduce a parameter of exposure to neighbors to the model. Language groups result from clustering similar languages, each of which is spoken by an agent. Experimental results show a certain degree of the exposure is necessary for creolization. Further investigation suggests that the structure of the social network affects that of agents' grammars.",>Makoto Nakamura>Shingo Hagiwara>Satoshi Tojo,>Nagoya University>Toyama National College of Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0632/index.html

We hypothesize that generating new product ideas is induced by unexpected assemblage of presented different product components. This hypothesis was evaluated by analyzing playing logs of a developed Web based tool to enjoy assemblage of elements whereof categories are consisting of three components, i.e., purpose, function and material. We defined generating new product ideas is associated with possible architectural compatibility. As a result of 11players, we found that generating ideas tends to be either visible products or invisible products as a service, depending on one’s attention to purpose at initial stage, e.g., the more purpose is considered, the more ideas are relatively visible products. In addition, the meaning of purpose has been interpreted as means to new product ideas.",>Jun Nakamura>Yukio Ohsawa,>Kanazawa Institute of Technology>University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0633/index.html

In the experiments, we conducted both explicit and implicit priming tasks with state and city names as stimuli. Participants were required to judge whether the target city or state name was a real one or a fake one. The results indicated direction between prime and target (state-to-city or city-to-state) had no effects on amount of priming. The cultural difference was significant only in the explicit priming task: amount of priming was larger in Malaysian participants compared to both American and Japanese participants in SOA700, while there were no cultural differences in SOA200. These results imply Malaysians are engaged in more context dependent cognition; in other words, participants consciously use a prime as a context cue to anticipate a target item. And this cultural difference was disappeared in implicit semantic processing.",>Hiroko Nakamura>Hiroshi Yama>Gary L.

The present study employed a speech-error induction technique to identify speech errors that strongly resembled recall errors observed in verbal immediate serial recall. In three experiments, participants repeatedly produced a target word/nonword and, immediately before the utterance, were unexpectedly exposed to an auditory distractor word/nonword, which was either phonologically similar or dissimilar to the target. This technique successfully induced within-word phoneme exchange/transposition errors and elicited a within-word serial-position effect. On the other hand, lexical/semantic variables (e.g., lexicality of the target) led to only a very weak effect.

2012,An Analysis of Disfluencies in the Actor's Speech for Character Design,"This paper presents an analysis of quantified characteristics of Disfluency pattern of a leading South Korean film actor Kang-ho Song’s Speech for character design in No.3 (Comedy, 1997), Memories of Murder (Thriller, 2003) and Thirst (Melodrama, 2009). Disfluencies, such as filled pause, repeated words, and repair or repetition utterance, are prevalent in spontaneous spoken language and show remarkably regular trends in a number of dimensions (Elizabeth Shriberg, 1994). The transcriptions of the actor's speech with disfluencies and variables in above films are analyzed, which might affect fluency rates in a corpus. It will be seen that the rates of disfluencies, induced by artificial manipulations, reflect the psychological state of a character. The actor's disfluency rates were relatively increased in Comedy and Thriller than Melodrama. Disfluencies are related with these cinematic factors: movie genre, actor role. Reflecting these features, we then recognize the acoustic features needed for character design.",>Seung Suk Nam>Hye Rhang Cho>Sook Whan Cho,>Sogang University>Sogang University>Sogang University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0637/index.html

Cognitive-behavioral strategies focus on challenging and changing dysfunctional cognitions and maladaptive behaviors that are believed to play a role in minimizing the risk of depression. This study used a mixed method design. The findings showed that women receiving the program had significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared to the control group during pregnancy and at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Women perceived the program to be helpful in fostering the development of cognitive-behavioral skills, enhancing their confidence in taking up the maternal role, and improving their emotional control in the perinatal period.

Participants were assigned to one of two primary tasks, evaluation of satisfaction or time length while “waiting until the e-mail has been sent.” Simultaneously, they executed one of two secondary tasks, calculating a consecutive numbers or solving a crossword puzzle. Result showed that the crossword task has stronger influences than calculation task in general, and surprisingly showed decrease of satisfaction with short waiting time, while showing shortening of psychological time with longer waiting time. That is, events associated with waiting process affect satisfaction evaluation and time perception in different ways.

The present study investigated the role of task complementarity in this social Simon effect by assigning same (e.g., red/green) or different (e.g., red/square) target feature dimensions (color/shape) to the two participants. We also investigated the role of response complementarity by manipulating the proportion of trials to which both, one, or neither of the participants responded.

We conducted gaze-cueing studies (e.g. Friesen & Kingstone, 1998), using dynamic emotional facial cues (i.e. happy, anger, fearful, and neutral expressions). A facial cue with gazing either left or right was presented. Participants were asked to indicate a position of the target that appear either at the looked-at (valid) location or the invalid location as quickly as possible. Subsequently, Participants were asked to classify each facial expression by a forced choice in the recognition task. It was revealed that fearful expressions facilitated the gaze-orienting effect compared to other expressions, only when the recognition of facial expressions was more accurate. The findings indicate that the accuracy of recognizing emotional facial expressions at the early perceptual stage influence the reflexive orienting to other’s gaze.",>Yuka Nishiyama>Jun Kawaguchi,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0642/index.html

Relationships and bonds with these communities are formed by daily communications. There are two main communication channels: verbal and non-verbal. Non-verbal communication channels are important for creating relationships within communities. Facial expressions are formed implicitly, and it is difficult for a person to know his/her expressions when having a conversation. Thus, we present a case study in which participants explore their own facial expressions by taking photos while having conversations. The process of the exploration includes taking photos, categorizing and labeling each expression, and making a pictorial book using these photos. Through this process, participants were able to know his/her expressions explicitly, which allowed them to reflect on their interactions within conversations. This indicates that, the process encourages meta-cognitive explorations by participants.

(2) Design thinking usually goes not straight to the goal but requires trial-and-error processes in which repetitive divergent and convergent thinking are taken. (3) For converging the trial-and-error to goal, designer needs self-evaluations in every step of getting tentative solutions. (4) Even though the collective thinking and discussions facilitate this process, creative result can be carried out basically depend on each designer's self-evaluation.

Although such choice is one of the key factors of consumer behavior, very few experimental studies have been done thereon. In the present study, repetitive choices among known goods and unknown goods are performed by utilizing mineral water as stimuli and characteristics related to the choice are examined. Further, brain activity during product choice was measured with fMRI. As a result, subjects who had a tendency to seek for information tend to choose unknown goods more and activity in the right frontal pole was observed when unknown goods were chosen. These results indicate that choosing unknown goods is a behavior for the purpose of gaining information but not a consequence of balancing the profits and losses.",>Ikuya Nomura>Kazuyuki Samejima>Kazuhiro Ueda>Yuichi Washida>Hiroyuki Okada>Takashi Omori,>The University of Tokyo>Tamagawa University>The University of Tokyo / CREST>Hitotsubashi University>Tamagawa University>Tamagawa University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0646/index.html

The results demonstrated that students with sophisticated beliefs in mixed-group rated their own clarification higher compared to students with naïve beliefs and to students in sophisticated-group.

2012,A Method of interviewing to Constructively Generate a Narrative through Interactions between Interviewer and Interviewee - A Case Study to Examine Creative Thoughts of an Architectural Student -,"We discuss both a method of interviewing about an individual’s creative thinking and a method of recording an interviewer’s behavior. From the viewpoint of scientific examination, interviewing is supposed to be an act of retrieving an interviewee’s thoughts in a raw manner without being influenced by the interviewer’s viewpoints or intentions. An individual’s thoughts are, however, mostly tacit knowledge. Even the individual himself is not necessarily able to externalize it by himself. We argue, rather, that interviewing should be an act of generating a narrative in a constructive manner through active interactions between an interviewer and an interviewee. Based on this paradigm change, we have devised a method of interviewing using a memo tool so that the interaction becomes active. Moreover we have developed a method of recording an interviewer’s behavior situated in the interaction in order to examine what kind of behaviors make the interaction active.",>Haruka Nukariya>Masaki Suwa,>Keio University>Keio University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0648/index.html
2012,Do children who experience regret make better decisions? A developmental study of the behavioral consequences of regret,"To date there has been little research investigating the assumption that experienced regret influences future decision making. Three novel experiments examined the relationship between children’s ability to experience regret and the quality of their subsequent decision making. Children chose between two options on Day 1, discovered the non-chosen option was more attractive, and rated their feelings about their choice. On Day 2, to assess choice switching, children were presented with the same choice. Experiment 1 found regret and adaptive choice switching emerged around 7 years of age. Experiments 2 and 3, found that 6-and 7-year-olds who experienced regret on Day 1, engaged in profitable decision making significantly more often than those who did not experience the emotion. These findings remained even when age and verbal ability were controlled for. These findings suggest that the experience of regret influences similar future decision making in childhood.",>Eimear O'Connor>Aidan Feeney>Teresa McCormack,">Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland>Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland>Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0649/index.html
2012,Analysis of Human Solving Process of Constraint Satisfaction Problem,"This study discusses cognitive process in solving constraint satisfaction problem in terms of both operation and information acquisition strategies by examining human process data with eye mark tracking solving Sudoku. Generally a Sudoku problem is defined as a CSP where a cell corresponds to a variable, and its domain of values is a set of the numbers. One of the major inference strategies to solve it is constraint propagation based on local consistency that resolves conflicts within a local variable set, and a problem that is solvable only by resolving the two-variable consistency is classified as ""easy"". However, the result of human data does not support this naive problem definition and the strategy. It can be explained by another problem representation where a number corresponds to a variable, and a cell to a domain value. We check the cognitive validity of this representation and the strategies based on it.",>Hidemi Ogasawara>Yoshiyuki Matsuzawa>Masahide Ogawa,>Chukyo University>Chukyo University>Chukyo University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0650/index.html
2012,Towards the Development of Integrated Narrative Generation System as the Implementation of Literary Knowledge,"Narrative contains diverse literary elements (e.g. narrator, character, story, plot, media), and narrative generation system should organically combine them. Previously, we developed a variety of the elements comparatively individually. The current goal is to develop a system in which all modules are organically integrated. This paper shows the pilot integrated system including about 800 modules and conceptual dictionaries, moreover discusses a detailed design for the revised version. The generation phase is divided into story, discourse, and expression. Story and discourse are described as each conceptual structure. The transformation by narrative techniques is corresponding to the narrative generation process. The mechanism is constructed by the integration of AI techniques such as script, story grammar, discourse relations and narratological knowledge such as Propp’s story structure, Genette’s discourse theory and Jauss’s reception theory. In this sense, this system is also an approach integrating the interdisciplinary genres. The generation process is executed by a control mechanism that selects techniques to be used based on the parameters for defining structures and characteristics of the narrative to be generated.",>Takashi Ogata>Taisuke Akimoto,">Iwate prefuctural university, Iwate, Japan>Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0651/index.html
2012,Effect of Age-related Decline of Task Switching on the Task Sequences that Simulate Real Job,"Task switching is an important cognitive function when older adults work using ICT equipment. We focused on properties of older adults’ task switching function in order to design usable ICT equipment. Generally, a worker has to execute some tasks serially by switching them reciprocally. In this study, some equences such as AB, AAB, or AAAAB were taken into consideration because there are routine tasks and rare tasks. Participants were 24 older adults and 24 younger adults. Reaction times and switch costs of various sequences were analyzed. As the result, although switch costs for older adults were heavier in AAB than AB, the switch costs did not increase for longer repetition of A (i. e., AAAB and AAAAB). The heaviest switch cost was seen in AAB when A was a difficult task and B was an easy task. These results were different from those of younger adults.",>Keiji Ogata>Satoru Suto>Kazutaka Ueda>Takatsune Kumada>Tohru Ifukube,>Azbil Corporation>Shizuoka University>The University of Tokyo>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0652/index.html
2012,Rhetoric of Biopic and Viewer's Reconsideration : Isn’t “story” an Obstacle?,"In the cognitive process when the viewers of narrative moving images appreciate its world and to deepen their consideration, is it “story” or “rhetoric” to take an important role? This is the interdisciplinary point at issue cross-linking the domain where study such as art, literature, rhetoric, and a problem of representation with images, and a cognitive-affective mechanism are connected. Therefore this study used two biopics - ""Tower of TARO"" and ""YUMEJI"", and examined it. After having shown the 10 minutes partial images which experimenters fixed, the questionnaire was performed for 267 participants. The question was given ""how you reconsidered the concept that experimenters showed to watch each image"". Free variables were made by the answers about disposition to various images, ANOVA was carried out afterwards. As a result, it was suggested that the deep concept reconsideration might occur more towards the viewers which minded rhetoric than story development.",>Yukiko Ogawa>Akihito Kanai,>HOSEI University>HOSEI University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0653/index.html
2012,Developmental Adjustment of Iconic Language in Care-Takers' Input,"This study explores how care-takers use mimetics -a word class which has a clear sound symbolism- in communicating with their children to investigate the role of iconicity in the input for language development. We approached the question by combining a study of mother-child interaction corpus and a Child-Directed-Speech elicitation experiment, in which care-takers were asked to describe animated actions first to their child and then to an adult experimenter. The results showed that care-takers use mimetics more frequently and use them alone as interjections without embedding them in a sentence for younger children. As their child develop care-takers begin to use mimetics adverbially in a sentence, as they do in Adult-Directed-Speech. This change suggests that care-takers adjust the degree of iconicity in the input according to the child's developmental stage, from bare use to syntactically embedded use of mimetics, and then eventually to non-mimetic conventional words.",>Masato Ohba>Noburo Saji>Mutsumi Imai>Tomoko Matsui,>Tamagawa University>Keio University / JSPS>Keio University>Tokyo Gakugei University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0654/index.html
2012,Effects of Language on Asynchronized Audiovisual Speech Perception,"When people are exposed to asynchronized audiovisual speech, they feel that something is unnatural. We performed tests to determine whether the language used in audiovisual speech affected the observer's perception. In experiment 1, we examined whether Japanese native speakers were more sensitive to audiovisual asynchrony in Japanese audiovisual speech than in English audiovisual speech by using simultaneity judgment tasks. Results showed that the language had no effect on sensitivity to audiovisual asynchrony. In experiment 2, we examined whether audiovisual asynchrony affected the observer's perception of loudness. Results showed that the observer perceived a voice to be quieter when the speaker's face moved after the speaker had spoken. This effect was weaker when the reverse was true and the speaker’s face moved first, followed by the speaker's voice. Moreover, the effect was also not as strong when Japanese native speakers observed asynchronized audiovisual speech in English as opposed to Japanese.",>Hitoshi Ohnishi>Kaname Mochizuki,>The Open University of Japan>Teikyo University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0655/index.html
2012,The effects of regularity in spatial inferences with and without local landmarks on spatial learning,"Regularity in spatial inferences during wayfinding has a different effect on spatial learning depending on clues available in an environment. Our previous study has revealed that the irregular updating, which involves multidirectional self-to-object updating, has a facilitation effect when global landmarks are available, while it impedes the learning without the landmarks. In the present study, we examined the updating mode in the context of local landmark information. In the experiment using a real maze, participants visited multiple targets in one of four conditions by a combination of two factors: an updating mode (regular or irregular) and an environmental information mode (with or without local landmarks). The results suggest that there is an interaction between factors. Although there is no difference between three of the conditions (regular & landmarks, regular & no landmarks, and irregular & landmarks), the irregular updating impedes the learning without the landmarks.",>Kayoko Ohtsu>Yoshihiro Ouchi,>Waseda University>Teikyo-Gakuen Junior College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0656/index.html
2012,Computational model of the meaning acquisition of sentence-final particles,"Sentence-final particles serve an important role in (spoken) Japanese, because they express the speaker's mental attitudes toward the proposition and/or the interlocutor. They are acquired at early ages and occur very frequently in everyday conversation. There has been, however, little proposal for the computational model of the acquisition of sentence-final particles. The purpose of this study is to get a robot to learn how to act upon the utterance with a sentence-final particle. The robot learns appropriate responses based on the rewards given by the interlocutor. The experimental results show that the robot learns to behave correctly in response to `yo,' which expresses the speaker's intention to communicate new information, and to `ne,' which denotes the speaker's desire to confirm that some information is shared. Using the learned actions as a lead, the acquisition of inner information processing such as word learning is the next research target.",>Natsuki Oka>Naohiro Nonoguchi>Chie Fukada>Motoyuki Ozeki,">Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan>Kyoto Institute of Technology>Kyoto Institute of Technology>Kyoto Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0657/index.html

The magnitude decision task for eight number pairs, e.g. “3-5”, was used in this study. Participants were 40 first graders children. An ANOVA for the decision time revealed that the main effect of number pairs is significant (F(1, 39) = 8.45, p<.01). A Tukey’s HSD test indicated that the decision time for “4-6” and “5-7” were slower than for “3-5”, and the time for “9-11” and “10-12” were slower than for “8-10”. These results indicated that there are the five-break and the decade-break in metal number line in Japanese children. And a negative correlation between the decision time and the performances of calculation problem were obtained.

2012,Influences of a potential interlocutor on the utterances of the speakers who try to describe objects,"Two sets of production tests were conducted in January and February in 2012, both in Tokyo and in Mannheim (Germany) to capture differences of utterances which subjects produced with or without the presence of another person, who sat at 45 deg. left in front of them, remained silent, but pretended to be ready to talk with them. The subjects were requested to describe or comment on objects appearing on the computer display at an interval of 10 sec. Our working hypothesis is that intersubjective expressions such as end-particles in Japanese (JEPs) and modal particles in German (GMPs) would be more freuently observed with the presence of a potential interlocutor. The result was that although the influence was confirmed, GMPs were rarely used even in her presence, while JEPs were frequently used even without her presence. This sugguests that there is a crucial difference in terms of interlocutor's commitment.",>Junji Okamoto>Saori Ushiyama,>Gakushuin University>Gakushuin University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0659/index.html
2012,Delay of word order development in Japanese? Evidence from a preferential looking study with 19 and 30-month-old children,"Word order constitutes a fundamental cue for sentence comprehension. Previous research on English and French found evidence for adult-like word order knowledge in 19-month-olds, but little is known about early word order development in languages with frequent word order alteration and argument omissions that reduce positive evidence for the canonical word order. To address this question, we conducted (i) a distributional analysis of word order variation in child-directed Japanese, and (ii) a preferential-looking study with Japanese 19- and 30-month-olds, using the same design as a previous study on French 19-month-olds. Our analysis of 17726 child-directed utterances revealed that 91% of the input was uninformative for identifying the canonical SOV order. Next, our preferential-looking experiment revealed that Japanese 19-month-olds fail to understand sentences with a canonical word order, unlike French 19-month-olds or Japanese 30-month-olds. We suggest that the sparseness of SOV in the input delays the development of word order knowledge.",>Akira Omaki>Romy Lassotta>Tessei Kobayashi>Luigi Rizzi>Julie Franck,>Johns Hopkins University>University of Geneva>NTT Communication Science Laboratories>University of Siena>University of Geneva,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0660/index.html
2012,Effects of supraliminal and subliminal hint priming on insight problem solving.,"In two experiments, a total of 135 participants engaged in a 10-coin problem for four minutes. Half of them were exposed to a hint figure one time per ten seconds. In Experiment 1, the hint figure was presented for one second, and participants were told that this figure was unrelated to the problem (supraliminal priming). Thus, they were aware of the figure, but they were unaware that it served as a hint. In Experiment 2, the hint was presented for thirty milliseconds, and it was masked by geometric configurations (subliminal priming). This ensured that participants were unaware of the hint. Both types of hint increased the solution rate. These results suggest that the conscious access to the hint is not essential for the priming effects. Exposure to a hint can activate insightful ideas without awareness, and it increases the probability of producing an appropriate strategy to escape from an impasse.",>Ryo Orita>Masasi Hattori,">Graduate School of Letters, Ritsumeikan University>Department of Psychology, Ritsumeikan University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0661/index.html

But it is difficult to promote successive individual learning based on the experience of the project. To improve the linkage between the project and the subsequent activities, this study attempted to exploit the context-based approach to enhance the reflection by the students under the design experiment. The results showed that more than half of the second year students successfully used the findings through the project activities to define their individual research theme. Also their final reports were well-organized and the level of the consideration was relatively high than that of the first year. In the real world settings like workplace, it is important to figure out the situations carefully before applying the individual knowledge or skill.

These tasks, which predict several aspects of higher-order cognition, have associated ranges of storage item sizes that are regularly controlled to avoid ceiling and floor effects in performance distributions. To examine the memory load incurred by the ranges of storage item sizes, this study used different storage item sizes for complex span tasks across verbal, numerical, and spatial content domains. Particularly examined were the relations among processing, storage, and general fluid abilities of the different storage item sizes of complex span tasks. Results of latent-variable analysis indicate different relations among these components of participants’ performances in complex span tasks, for which the item sizes differed. The influences on the memory load of storage item sizes of these tasks are discussed.",>Kazunori Otsuka>Makoto Miyatani,>University of Nagasaki>Hiroshima University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0663/index.html

This study examined whether mind wandering is detected through the monitoring process requiring attentional resources. In the first task, participants read a short story, where the constituent words were presented one-by-one and the next word appeared by pressing a key. The reading time for each word was measured. As a secondary task, one group reported the occurrence of mind wandering each time they noticed it during the reading. The other group performed a prospective memory task (detecting target words) that required attentional resources, and the control group performed only the reading task. The result showed that while performing the prospective memory task increased the mean reading time, the reporting of mind wandering did not influence it. This finding suggests that the detection of mind wandering did not require attentional resources.",>Sho Otsuka>Takahiro Sekiguchi,">Graduate School of Education, Tokyo Gakugei University>Department of Educational Psychology, Tokyo Gakugei University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0664/index.html

We analyzed, quantitatively and qualitatively, the problems that arose in expository writing assignments, and the relevance of grade calculations. Furthermore, we also surveyed student attitudes toward written assignments in order to examine appropriate methods of support in the revision process. Expository writing texts are composed of a title, a body text, and a bibliography. The body text contains the definition of the theme, the reason for the choice of theme, questions that arise relating to the theme, exploration of these questions, and the conclusions.

2012,Loosely symmetric heuristics as the basis for biases and the empirical Bayes methods,"The loosely symmetric (LS) model, a conditional probability-like formula describing human symmetric cognitive biases, is shown to be effective in an ample amount of areas including causal induction, learning (reinforcement, supervised and unsupervised), game-theoretical situations and digital game AI. However, despite its interesting mathematical properties, the total rationale for the model has not been given. In this study, we analyze LS from the viewpoint of Bayesian statistics, especially of the empirical Bayes methods. As the result, we show that the bias terms in LS, which deviates LS from the ordinary conditional probability, are the hyper parameters for the prior Beta distribution LS assumes. Given this analysis, LS is shown to describe various cognitive biases including Gambler’s fallacy, status quo bias, the framing effect, dependence to the reference point and the reflection effect, etc., all at the same time.",>Kuratomo Oyo>Tatsuji Takahashi,>Tokyo Denki University>Tokyo Denki University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0666/index.html
2012,How simple explanations change our minds and why we prefer them,"People prefer simpler explanations and judge them more satisfying, where simplicity is defined as the number of unexplained causes in the explanation (“root simplicity”). But what are the effects of this preference on cognition and why do people like simple explanations? We consider the answers to these questions with three experiments. Our findings suggest that the participants who select simpler explanations when the simpler explanation conflicts with available data are more likely to overestimate how often they saw data points consistent with their chosen explanation. We show that choosing a simpler explanation causes this data distortion. We find that the preference for root simplicity is stronger when root causes greatly alter the probability of their effects. This aligns with arguments suggesting a preference for root simplicity results from the desire to efficiently encode observations and to support effective interventions. These findings have implications for theories of inference and explanation.",>Michael Pacer>Tania Lombrozo,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0667/index.html

The goal of this study was to explore whether people from different culture backgrounds adopt varied concepts to categorize objects. Participants from eastern and western were required to rate association strength of word pairs in questionnaires which used five-point-scale. Two types of word relations are manipulated. These words were paired by taxonomic (e.g., banana - apple) or thematic (e.g., banana - orangutan) categories. The results showed culture differences. Relative to western people, easterners tend to put weaker emphasis on objects’ taxonomic categories than on thematic relations.

2012,Do Objects Matter for Infants’ Formation of a Spatial Category?,"Presenting a relation using simplified objects facilitates the generalization of that relation in older children and adults (e.g., Kaminski, Sloutsky, & Heckler, 2006, 2008). We investigated infants’ ability to form a category of a support relation (i.e., “on”) when the objects that depicted the relation were perceptually simple versus more complex. Fifty-three infants of 8 and 14 months were habituated to dynamic support events with either simple or complex objects. They were then tested with events with novel objects, a novel spatial relation, or both. Infants at each age formed a support category, looking significantly longer at test events with a novel than familiar relation. There was a marginal effect of object complexity. The current results suggest a role of object features in infant spatial categorization, and provide the first evidence that infants of 8 months can form a spatial category of support relations.",>Youjeong Park>Marianella Casasola,>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0669/index.html
2012,Cross-level Illusory Conjunction between Implied (Semantic) and Actual (Perceptual) Colors,"Goldfarb and Treisman (2010) found observers made more perceptual binding errors (illusory conjunctions, ICs) when the features of an object were inconsistent. They suggested that such mistakes originate from features in the same level. We investigated whether we could induce ICs across perceptual and semantic domains by manipulating the font colour of object words containing implied colours. In Experiment 1, participants saw very brief displays of four Chinese characters (日(sun), 火(fire),山(hill), 水(water)) printed in either yellow, red, green, or blue. Observers had to report the physical color of a randomly selected target word in each trial. We observed significantly higher error rates when the words were printed in colours incongruent with their implied color. We replicated the result with a set of English words (lemon-yellow, water-blue, blood-red, and grass-green) in Experiment 2, which led us to conclude that illusory conjunctions can arise in the gulf between semantic and perceptual domains.",>Chan Jeong Park>Anna Wing Yee Ho>Geroldene H.

We, however, suggest that the influence of probability decreases when a global strategy includes multiple selections with a single goal. A game, which involves a tournament of 8 teams, is introduced to the participants and they were asked to select 4 teams so that their selection includes the winner. Participants’ choice responses were classified into 2 types. The first type is to pick all the 4 teams on one side of the bracket (a sure 50% to win) making the degree of uncertainty minimized. The second type includes all other ways of selection, except the first type, with greater uncertainty.

2012,The Effect of Perceptual Complexity on Affective Picture Processing,"Previous ERP studies using IAPS (International Affective Picture System) pictures have reported several ERP components (e.g., P1, N2, LPP) whose amplitudes are modulated by valence and arousal. But Bradley and her colleagues (2007) reported that early ERPs were modulated only by perceptual complexity, and only late ERPs (LPP) were modulated by affective factors. To elucidate the modulatory effect of perceptual complexity and affective valence of IAPS pictures on ERPs, we manipulated perceptual complexity and valence of them. Pleasant, neutral, and negative pictures from IAPS depicting either simple figure-ground compositions or complex scenes were selected. Each picture was presented for 2 s and participants were required to do valence discrimination response. 30-electrodes ERP data of 28 university students were analyzed. Mean amplitudes of early posterior P1 and P2, and LPP showed interaction effect of perceptual complexity and valence, and showed perceptual complexity effect only for neutral and positive pictures (no perceptual complexity effect for negative pictures). Time-frequence analysis showed similar results: Power of alpha and theta activities showed perceptual complexity effect only before 300ms, and showed the effect only for neutral and positive pictures. These results suggest that early ERPs can be modulated by affective valence and perceptual complexity only for neutral and positive pictures, and valence effect of negative pictures might override the effect of perceptual complexity.",>Taejin Park>Soodam Park,">Chonnam National University, South Korea>Chonnam National University, South Korea",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0672/index.html

Visual saliency is used as a criterion for selecting the local regions from where HoG features are extracted. Experimental results show that such saliency-based masking significantly affects the classification performance: contrary to the previous reports in the field of object recognition, the low-salient regions contribute more than the high-salient regions in scene classification, and that is consistent with several previous reports of insisting the importance of spatial layout in the low frequency channel, which support the scene schema hypothesis. Also, the result implies that the highest salient regions, which occupies top 20 percent in saliency, hardly contribute to classification performance.",>Tae-Suh Park>Byoung-Tak Zhang,>Seoul National University>Seoul National University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0673/index.html
2012,fMRI evidence for sensitivity to coherence and context in the theory of mind network,"Much neuroimaging work converges on a set of brain regions engaged in representing the mental states of other agents. These regions, the theory of mind (ToM) network, include the bilateral temporoparietal junction, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and precuneus. Studies employing diverse methodologies consistently reveal greater activation in the ToM network to stimuli that prompt mental state attribution relative to various control conditions. However, attempts to elicit differential responses within the network by manipulating mental state content have typically failed. We report findings that the network is sensitive to two features of mental state stories. First, the hemodynamic response is reduced following a coherence break in the stories’ plot relative to a coherent condition, in both ToM and left-hemisphere language areas. Second, the amount of context provided is positively related to the strength of activation in the network. These results suggest that ToM representation depends on a sustained input of coherent information.",>Alexander Paunov>Jorie Koster-Hale>Rebecca Saxe,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0674/index.html

2012,fMRI of attention and automaticity in judgments from facial appearance,"Facial social judgments such as trustworthiness, indeed the processing of facial and emotional stimuli are fast (Bar, 2006) and are often proposed to take place in an automatic fashion, that is independent of top down factors such as attention (Jonides 1983). Here we present work that challenges the automaticity account of such judgements. In a series of experiments we apply load theory (Lavie, 1995, 2010), to investigate subjective judgements under load. Employing a combined visual search and face judgement task, where the level of attentional load in the search task was manipulated (by varying the search set size) the results indicated reduced accuracy for trustworthy judgements under the effects of attentional (perceptual) load. Finally, in a neuro-imaging task (that is a pure signal response to facial stimuli) we again illustrate the effect of load, where high load modulates (at a neural basis) trustworthy faces.",>Ramsey Raafat>Nikos Konstantinou>Chris Frith>Nilli Lavie>Nick Chater,">University College London, Cognitive, Perceptual and Brain Sciences>University of Cyprus, Department of Psychology>University College London, Wellcome Centre for Functional Neuroimaging>University College London, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience>University of Warwick, Warwick Business School",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0676/index.html
2012,Cooperative Behavior in Multicultural Settings: The Contribution of Altruistic Punishment,"In this study we want to explore the behavior of altruistic punishment, investigated through the Third Party Punishment game. This game shows the behavior of spending one’s own money, without any personal benefit, to punish unfair behavior of players who violate cooperation norms. This behavior may be differently displayed depending on the in-group versus out-group setting, and typically favors one’s own group (the so called parochial altruism). We compared two different cultural groups: Italian (N=26) versus Chinese people (N=26). In both groups, our results show the presence of altruistic punishment behavior, and this tendency emerges much prominent when facing another group’s player who behaves unfairly with one’s own group members. Furthermore the whole sample shows the propensity to spend little sums of money to punish also fair behaviors: this attitude is known as antisocial punishment. Our data also show that Italians spend significantly higher amounts than Chinese for antisocial punishment.",>Daniela Rabellino>Rosalba Morese>Angela Ciaramidaro>Bruno G.

2012,Why so Stressful? The effect of coping strategies and social support to undergraduate students in Korea,"Purpose: To investigate the amount of stress that Nursing College Students for Nursing Examination acceptance competitions and campus life. Method: The data was collected from 250 students at S Nursing College in Seoul, Korea using questionnaires including the following: CES-D(Center for Epidemiologic Studies – Depression), BAI(Beck Anxiety Inventory), Coping Stress Scale, Self Esteem Scale, Social Support. Results: The average score for the CES-D turned out to be 18.43(SD: 7.25) which higher than the average 14.77(SD: 9.47) which was firefighters in Seoul, Korea who had experienced many kinds of disasters. As a result, the mediating effects of positive emotion on the relationship between the social factors and CES-D /BAI were supported. CES-D was positively related only to social support(r = 6.47, p < .000) and especially, CES-D most related family support which one of the social support and didn’t any relationship with the amount of other scales. Conclusions: We must acknowledge the fact that the amount of stress being received by college students preparing for Nursing Examination is very severe. The amount of stress was even higher than that of college students who experienced a natural disaster. There should be active programs in Nursing College to alleviate this stress if we want to have brighter, healthier college students in the future.",>Young Sun Ryu>Ha Rim Kim>Jeong Ryu,>Seoul National University>Seoul National University>Seoul National University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0678/index.html
2012,Automatic Reverse Engineering of Human Beavior Based on Text for Knowledge Acquisition,"We propose a novel approach for building cognitive architectures based on Wisdom of Crowd. As knowledge needed for an intelligent system is difficult to gather and heavily depends on a programmer's bias, we decided to automize the process of surveying reactions, decisions, opinions, etc. For demonstrating the usability of our approach we implemented Web-mining functions into our system and tested it by confronting with over 100 ethically-significant real world problems, e.g. ""killing a man"", ""stealing money"", ""bribing someone"", ""helping people"" or ""saving environment"". The accuracy was 86% when used emotional consequences discovery, however we show how adding social consequences discovery, natural language processing tools and bigger data sets are able to refine the results and increase correctness of moral judgment. We discuss the importance of such algorithm based on crowd behavior, which opens a path for retrieving universal transcultural rules when the system becomes multilingual and compares results from different nations.",>Rafal Rzepka>Kenji Araki,">Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan>Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0679/index.html
2012,The Internal Structures of Sound-Symbolic Systems: the Universal and Language-Specific Portions of Sound Symbolism,"This paper demonstrates a new quantitative approach to identify what is behind universally sensed sound-symbolism and sound-symbolism detected only by speakers of a particular language. For this purpose, we presented 70 locomotion videos to English and Japanese speakers and asked them to create a word that would sound-symbolically match each action. Then the participants rated each action on 6 semantic dimensions. Multivariate analysis detected what level of sound-unit (e.g., phonetic features, phoneme, mora) are linked to each semantic dimension. Results revealed that certain sound-meaning links (e.g., voicing and heaviness) are more consistent than others within and across languages. Furthermore, language-specific sound-symbolism was found in the particular sound-units (e.g., the sequence of a voiced initial consonant and a middle-low vowel and heaviness in English). This implies that the language-specific sound-symbolism is motivated by the phonological system each language possesses, whereas universal sound-symbolism appears at the more abstract level of sound component.",>Noburo Saji>Kimi Akita>Mutsumi Imai>Katerina Kantartzis>Sotaro Kita,>Keio University/JSPS>Osaka University>Keio University>University of Birmingham>University of Birmingham,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0680/index.html
2012,Does word order influence non-verbal event description by speakers of OS language?,"Goldin-Meadow et al. (2008) examined whether word orders of speakers’ own languages influence their non-verbal behaviors by asking speakers of English, Chinese, Spanish, and Turkish to describe events non-verbally using gestures. They found that speakers of all four languages preferred to perform gestures in Actor-Patient-Action order. Although they argued that this reflects a natural order of event description for humans, their research is limited in languages with Subject-Object (SOV or SVO) word order. In order to verify their claim, we examined Kaqchikel, a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala, employing Object-Subject (VOS) word order. In our non-verbal event description experiment, 32 Kaqchikel native speakers described 18 pictures of transitive events using gestures. We found predominant Actor-Patient order (86.2%) as well as Patient-Actor order (13.8%). These results revealed that event descriptions are not only governed by universal conceptual preference to Actor-Patient order but also influenced by word orders of speakers’ own languages.",>Hiromu Sakai>Takuya Kubo>Hajime Ono>Manami Sato>Masatoshi Koizumi,>Hiroshima University>Hiroshima University>Kinki University>Hiroshima University>Tohoku University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0681/index.html

Although we participate in and contribute to various conversations everyday, we are not necessarily self-aware of what skills we employ to activate conversations. A good example of experts good at activating conversations is comedians. They quickly grasp what roles they are supposed to play in any changing circumstances in a TV variety show so that the whole atmosphere is enjoyable. Focusing on “Ametalk”, a popular Japanese TV variety show, we examined what skills comedians possess to direct conversations toward an enjoyable atmosphere. We analyzed conversations statistically from the viewpoints of “roles” and “rhetoric”, clarifying why comedians’ conversation makes us amused. Especially, our focus is on a popular comedian Mr. Kendo Kobayashi; we statistically showed that he not only makes an appeal of his strong personality by playing some roles he is good at playing, but also changes roles according to circumstances.",>Rui Sakaida>Masaki Suwa,>Keio University>Keio University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0682/index.html
2012,Collective decision-making processes in online social networks,"How do users process the vast amount of information available online to form opinions and make decisions? To answer this question, I analyzed individual and collective decision-making processes in a social media website, Digg. The results from behavioral experiments and computer simulations indicate that some users make decisions by following the choices of others. In particular, I found evidence of three types of following behavior – following the opinions of the whole community, following the opinions of specific individuals, and reciprocal following of pairs of users – that could contribute to the emergence of collective decisions in online communities. The results further suggest that knowing others’ opinion about a piece of information affects a user’s decisions to follow the opinion but not her perception of the information. I conclude by discussing the implications of this work for predicting trends as well as for using and designing social media websites.",>Yasuaki Sakamoto,>Stevens Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0683/index.html
2012,Innovating scuba diving education through enhanced immersion and authenticity within the eDiving® environment,"While recreational scuba diving is considered safe and easy to learn, people often become divers on vacation without frequent follow-up diving. Infrequent diving is ill-advised since the scuba diving skills deteriorate over time which can lead to diving accidents. We aim to address the gaps between diving activities by giving people the opportunity to practice relevant scuba diving skills at home. Although prior work on interactive e-learning environments has shown beneficial learning through adaptive personalized instruction, a missing element concerns physical education. As such, we will add two immersive technologies to enhance the authenticity within the interactive eDiving® simulator (http://www.ediving.us). For each technology we will run a laboratory and a field study, followed by a field study combining both technologies and using Open Water students. As such, our work not only can improve scuba education but also avoid deterioration of important scuba diving skills and consequently reduce diving accidents.",>Ron Salden,">Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0684/index.html
2012,"What is promoted by imitation, what promotes imitation: Relation to understanding of other’s mental states","Infants are more likely to imitate actions on objects than body movements (Rogdon & Kurdek, 1977). A recent developmental theory assumes the relationship between body imitation and understanding of other’s mental states such as intention (Meltzoff, 2004), but there are few evidence on such relationship. The present study was aimed to reveal the developmental linkage between body imitation and understanding of other’s intention in infancy. Twenty-two participants visited longitudinally at 13, 15, and 17 months of age. We conducted imitation tasks (object manipulations, gestures, and non-meaningful actions) at 13 and 17 months, and task of understanding of other’s intention at 15 months. Results showed a developmental path from imitation (non-meaningful actions) at 13 months to understanding other’s intention at 15 months, and also from understanding other’s intention at 15 months to imitation (gesture and non-meaningful actions) at 17 months.

2012,Conditions that Modulate Perceptual Interference,"Perceptual interference refers to less accurate memories due to verbalizing or imaging nonverbal experiences. We theorize that this occurs because people have prototypical representations of nonverbal stimuli, and these prototypical representations are activated when they verbalize or image exemplars of the stimuli. The activation takes place even though the prototype and the exemplar differ. When people are prompted to remember the exemplar, they mistakenly remember the prototype. In the present study, we want to identify conditions that modulate perceptual interference. We hypothesize that verbalizing nonverbal stimuli multiple times, in the absence of the actual stimuli, will increase the perceptual interference effect. We also hypothesize that viewing nonverbal stimuli multiple times will decrease the perceptual interference effect. Our sample consists of 48 students from a private Southern university and members of the surrounding community. Our hypotheses are supported, demonstrating that there are conditions that can affect the strength of perceptual inference.",>Ava Santos>Lawrence Barsalou>Christy Wilson,>Fort Lewis College>Emory University>Northeastern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0686/index.html

Joint attention plays an important role in making conversation smoothly and fulfilling sympathy for each other. And the effect of joint attention has been proved between humans and agents. In this experiment, humans are directed their attention to the certain location by agent’s instructions consisting of demonstrative pronoun. We made observations of the special relation between human and agent, and the human responses to the agent’s instructions. What the vague embodied agent is a sphere like bowling ball and its appearance doesn’t show where its attentions are turned makes people be unknown its directivity of attention. The result shows that it’s possible to achieve joint attention between human and the agent even if the agent’s appearance is too simple and doesn’t show where its attentions are turned.",>Ryo Sato>Yugo Takeuchi,">Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan>Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0688/index.html
2012,Looking at nothing facilitates memory retrieval,"People fixate on blank locations if task irrelevant visual stimuli previously occupied that region of space. This so-called ‘looking at nothing’ phenomenon has been associated to information retrieval from an integrated memory representation. However, it is unclear, whether it directly affects the retrieval of information from memory. To clarify this, 23 participants listened to four sentences, each associated to one of four areas on the screen. Subsequently, they had to verify an auditorily presented statement about one of the sentences, by retrieving the related information from memory. During retrieval, participants could either gaze freely, or had to look at a fixation cross that appeared in the area associated to the tested sentence or in one of the other three areas. This manipulation of eye movements significantly affected retrieval performance. The results conform to a grounded perspective on the looking at nothing phenomenon.",>Agnes Scholz>Katja Mehlhorn>Josef Krems,>Chemnitz University of Technology>Carnegie Mellon University>Chemnitz University of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0689/index.html

IDS is considered to draw the infants’ attention more than ADS, to convey adults’ emotional states to infants more easily, and to make language acquisition easier for infants. It is not clear, however, whether the use of IDS has some effects on the adults as well as on the infants. In this research, we focused on one of the most distinctive features of IDS, a high-pitched voice, and conducted two human-robot interaction experiments to examine whether or not the use of a high-pitched voice by the participants him/herself can create a good impression of the robot in their minds.

2012,An explanation for status of listening to the late musical works of Morton Feldman by cognitive point of view,"Abstract: Late musical works composed by Morton Feldman (1926-1987) have common characters, 1) a denial of the development by musical form, 2) a continuance of tranquility and monotonous texture and 3) very long duration of performance. When listening to these pieces, the listeners will just face to the each note rather than trace the musical form brought by the evaluation of result made by listener's expectation to the next musical scene in succession. Shono defines this status of listening as the process that listeners find out the meaning in each note actively, rather than understand the given meaning passively (Shono, 1991). In this study, we explain that the status of this listening are arisen by, a) forfeiture of figure and ground of time sensation, b) activation of multi and inter sensation by the forfeiture of figure and ground, and c) generation of ambiguity between listeners and musical work as an object.",>Takuro Shibayama>Tatsuji Takahashi,>Tokyo Denki University>Tokyo Denki University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0691/index.html

In physical expression, by repeating getting a sense by moving a body and giving meaning for that sense, it is necessary to clarify what one want to express. Placing one's physical movement in a story for oneself, it can promote to give concrete meanings for the physical movement therefore it can be useful exercise for the expression.

2012,Narrative Blending and Tense Aspect by Learners of Korean as a Second Language,"As reported in Shim (2011), advanced learners of Korean as a second language (L2) mostly produced background information by using various tense markers while foreground was dominantly described in past tense by learners of low proficiency. Why would proficient learners largely produce background information? This question is addressed in my paper. Unlike foreground, background information must include a description as well as views from an objective perspective, including a commentary and an explanation. It is suggested that, within the framework of Fauconnier and Turner (2002, 93-94), the perspective of the speaker as a writer in a ‘mental space’ must be linked and blended with that of the other in another space by the ‘Change’ and the ‘Identity’ vital relations, and that the blending must be learned by the L2 learners.

2012,Reassessing the motivation effect of illustrations in text comprehension,"Suppose that you find an article including an illustration that looks interesting, you might read it. My collaborator and I call this phenomenon the motivation effect of illustrations. We proposed an experimental method to evaluate the motivation effect of instructional manuals. In this method, participants were allowed to glance at one manual page for two seconds and were then asked to answer the following two questions: (a) “Did the page motivate you to read?” and (b) “Did the page look easy to understand?” The method was utilized to demonstrate that illustrations enhanced participants’ motivation for reading. But, in this previous study, participants glanced at the same stimuli twice or more in a single experiment, so the procedure could skew the motivation effect. The purpose of this study is reassessing the motivation effect of illustrations when the said problem is improved.

2012,Brain activity during observation of other’s action in live and delayed video-mediated social interaction,"Social interaction is largely facilitated by spatiotemporal contiguity among individuals. The brain area called the mirror neuron system (MNS), which is activated when an individual observes the actions of others, as well as when they perform the same action themselves, is considered to play a crucial role in social cognition. The present study investigated whether and how the MNS activity is influenced by temporal contiguity between the observer and observee: (1) live face-to-face, (2) live video-mediated, (3) 6s-delayed video-mediated, and (4) prerecorded action observation conditions. ANOVA revealed that there was a significant modulation by the conditions. MNS activity in the live face-to-face condition was significantly larger than that in the prerecorded condition. A moderate activity was observed in the live and 6s-delayed video-mediated conditions. These results indicate that MNS activity is sensitive to the temporal contiguity, which likely affects the quality of social interaction.",>Sotaro Shimada,">Meiji University, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0695/index.html
2012,Many faces of diagrams: from general properties to practial advantages and disadvantages,"Research on diagrammatic representations has revealed that they, as opposed to sentence-based representations, have the following general properties: (1) Expressing a certain set of information results in the expression of consequential information (e.g., Barwise & Etchemendy 1990), (2) Certain sets of information cannot be expressed alone, without the (at least selective) expression of other, non-consequential information (e.g., Stenning & Oberlander 1995), (3) Certain inconsistent sets of information cannot be expressed (e.g., Barwise & Etchemendy 1994), (4) Information of multiple levels of information can be expressed simultaneously and relatedly (e.g., Pinker 1990, Cleveland 1994). There has been an attempt to explain the cause of these properties in a unified manner (e.g., Shimojima 2002).

Similar to Elman's (1993) Simple Recurrent Network (SRN), sentences were concatenated and presented one shape at a time to participants, who predicted the next shape while the preceding seven shapes remained visible. The sentences represented a staged learning condition, with simple occurring before complex, or a mixed condition with simple and complex randomly ordered. Like the SRN, the participants' token predictions were frequently incorrect; however, accuracy was assessed by whether their prediction was grammatical. Accuracy was above chance in both the staged and mixed conditions demonstrating the beneficial effect of prediction errors, and it was significantly higher in the staged condition, where the stronger local contingencies facilitated category learning.",>WonJae Shin>Kathleen Marie Eberhard,">University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States>University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0697/index.html

Accordingly, training in critical thinking and debate is an important part of Japanese college education. In this study, 72 college students were given a newspaper article about homeless patients being ""dumped"" by hospitals in Los Angeles. The article was sympathetic to the patients. The students were then asked to comment on the situation from a ""neoliberal"" standpoint that stressed the value of competition. While 56 students had no difficulty arguing from the alternative standpoint, 16 students were unable to do so and disparaged the hospitals' immoral behavior.

2012,Magic props induce misdirection differently from the magician’s face,"Successfully conducting a magic performance requires that the magician guide the gaze of the audience away from the trick towards the props, which is known as misdirection. The role of the social cue, the direction of the magician's face, has been overestimated and the role of the props has been ignored until recently. We contested this assumption by using context congruent props, e.g., cards. Participants observed the same magic show twice. During the second observation, there was a mask on the magician's face, or on the prop, or there was no mask. The prop and the face independently caused misdirection during the second observation, implying that the social cue was not the only factor causing misdirection. It is suggested that top-down knowledge gradually modified the misdirection by inhibiting the fixation on the prop. We conclude that sufficient time is needed to activate top-down knowledge to cancel the misdirection.",>Marie Shoda>Kazuhiko Yokosawa,>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0699/index.html

However, it is unknown whether infants have a conceptual understanding of others' emotions and the contexts that elicit them, or merely a perceptual schema for emotional facial expressions. Using a violation of expectation paradigm, we tested whether 11 month old infants expect others' emotional reactions to be contextually congruent. Specifically, infants saw one adult (Observer) react to another adult's (Target) emotional expression. If the Observer was looking at the Target, infants expected the Observer to react congruently (positively to a happy Target, negatively to a sad Target), and looked longer at incongruent emotional reactions. Infants had no expectation of congruence if the Observer was looking away from, and could not see, the Target. This result suggests that within the first year of life, infants represent emotions in terms of the contexts that elicit them.",>Amy Skerry>Mina Cikara>Susan Carey>Elizabeth Spelke>Rebecca Saxe,>Harvard University>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Harvard University>Harvard University>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0700/index.html

2012,A Neuro-Robotics Model for the Acquisition of Higher Order Concepts in Action and Language,"Recent neurophysiological experiments have shown that motor neurons responsible for encoding specific motor acts present different activation patterns according to the final goal of the action sequence in which that particular motor act is embedded (Fogassi et al., 2005). This is consistent with the chain model hypothesis (Chersi et al., 2006) according to which the processing of action-related sentences involves the activation of the sequence of motor neurons (chain) directly involved in the sentence. We have developed a cognitive robotic model for the learning of compositional actions from combination of motor primitives. This model uses recurrent neural networks. Simulation results have shown that motor primitives have different activation patterns according to the action’s sequence in which they are contained. These results suggest that the motor chain hypothesis (Chersi et al., 2006) can be a general mechanism that explains the way in which recurrent networks represents and reuse hierarchical concepts.",>Francesca Stramandinoli>Davide Marocco>Angelo Cangelosi,>Plymouth University>Plymouth University>Plymouth University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0702/index.html
2012,Representational Translation with Concrete and Virtual Models in Organic Chemistry,"Organic chemists must understand the 3-D structure of molecules and be adept at relating different 2-D diagrammatic representations of molecules. Concrete (3D) models can aid chemistry students in developing these aspects of representational competence. A growing trend is to incorporate 3D virtual models into instruction. In two studies, we tested the relative effectiveness of concrete and virtual models when relating molecular representations. Participants completed tasks that involved matching either virtual or concrete models to three different types of molecular diagrams. There were no differences in accuracy for virtual and concrete models, but participants performed significantly faster with virtual models. The benefit likely resulted from the hand-held computer interface, which constrained interactivity to make the most task-relevant information salient. These results highlight the importance of interface design in promoting effective use of spatial representations, and suggest a potential benefit of teaching with virtual models rather than traditional media in chemistry.",>Andrew Stull>Trevor Barrett>Mary Hegarty,">University of California, Santa Barbara, California, United States>University of California, Santa Barbara, California, United States>University of California, Santa Barbara, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0703/index.html
2012,Language and Number Sense: ANS Representations for 'Most',"Quantificational expressions ('every', 'most', etc.) afford speakers the means to convey information about the quantity of entities pertinent to a conversation. Their formal linguistic properties have been studied in great detail (Barwise & Cooper 1981, etc.). However, little is known about how they are mapped onto cognitive representations of quantity—in particular, to what extent that mapping is determined by their linguistic properties. We present evidence from a series of experiments concerning the quantifier 'most' and argue that 1) it is, as a default, mapped onto representations of the Approximate Number System (ANS) rather than the precise numbers (cf.

2012,A left cerebral hemisphere’s superiority in processing spatial-categorical relation in a non-verbal semantic format.,"It has been shown that the left and right cerebral hemispheres (LH and RH) have preferences for processing qualitative (or “categorical”) and metric (or “coordinate”) spatial relations respectively. However, categorical spatial information could be divided into semantic- and visuospatial-categorical information. We examined whether semantic- and visuospatial-categorical information were different, and whether such a distinction was differentially lateralized. We manipulated the colors and positions of the standard traffic light sign so that either the semantic- or visuospatial-categorical information changed in a non-verbal format and used these stimuli in a sample-to-match task coupled to the divided visual field method. In the semantic-categorical matching task a LH’s advantage for processing semantic-categorical information was observed even in a non-verbal format. In the visuospatial-categorical matching task, however, neither left nor right visual field advantage was obtained. These results suggest the processing of semantic-categorical information is lateralized in LH and it is distinct from visuospatial-categorical information.",>Takashi Suegami>Bruno Laeng,>University of Oslo>University of Oslo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0705/index.html
2012,What role do you play in group activity? Objective evaluation through third parties,"Our daily life provides us a lot of opportunities to participate at work, learn and play with our peers: group learning in schools, training courses in the company, and even outdoor activities. The interactive roles of leaders and followers sometimes emerge and reorganize in our group activities. This study revealed both verbal and non-verbal cues for expressing emergent interactive roles in group activities. Objective evaluation through neutral third parties was conducted to select roles including leader, active or passive follower that the participants played in a triad assembly task. From the result of the correlation between behavioral data and third party evaluation, the interactive roles could have been characterized the amount of speech, i.e., potential leader talked more than potential followers. It was also suggested that the amount of gaze to other participants and the distance from them were useful cues for distinguishing active follower from passive one.",>Noriko Suzuki>Tosiro Kamiya>Ichiro Umata>Sadanori Ito>Shoichiro Iwasawa>Mamiko Sakata>Katsunori Shimohara,">Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/Doshisha University>Osaka University>NICT>NICT>NICT>Doshisha University

2012,Do we prefer simple realities or simple descriptions?,"Explanations play an important role in our mental lives. In most cases, however, explanations are not deducible outright; multiple explanations exist for any circumstance. Simplicity strongly biases preference. We distinguish between two cases: a preference for a simple underlying reality and a preference for a reality that can be simply described We created a fictional disease scenario with three symptoms; participants rated possible diagnoses. One diagnosis was complex (3 viruses), but had a simple term; the other diagnosis involved 2 viruses. Participants generally favored the simple world over the more complex. Additionally, participants preferred whichever explanation was currently described using fewer terms. About half of participants opted for the simpler label when available, but the simpler explanation when unavailable. It seems that people take into account both the simplicity of the world model postulated by a theory and also the simplicity with which a theory is expressed, when deciding among possible options.",>Colleen Szurkowski>David Landy,>University of Richmond>University of Richmond,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0707/index.html
2012,"Developing and Testing ""Visualizing Connection Note,"" a Constraint-Free Two-Dimensional Concept-Mapping Tool for Ideation","Writing a research paper imposes a heavy cognitive load wherein one gathers ideas, develops relations among them, and decides their order. This complex, time-consuming process can be facilitated by collecting daily ideas and laying them out freely on a two dimensional map. We thus developed “Visualizing Connection Note: ViCoNote,” which has cloud application “Evernote” on its left side and a two-dimensional space on its right side. The user can easily draw various documents like texts, photos, and voice memos from Evernote to the space, and try to group, superimpose, juxtapose, and connect them. One participant used ViCoNote for two months as a pilot study, and found that it facilitated recording contextual information for brainstorming as well as condensing the information for concept mapping.

2012,Cognitive process of the children with reading difficulties: Analysis of the reading patterns with customizable digital reading software.,"Children with reading difficulties, such as children with dyslexia, struggle with standard printed materials in regular classrooms. In this study, a reading support system with a text-to-speech function, “Touch & Read”, was developed to examine changes in textbook information comprehension among children. Using this system, readers can magnify text, or tap part of the text to listen to the words read aloud, and adjust the speed of such auditory feedback. The system can log the way that the reader uses it to be analyzed to report on points of difficult for a reader, as well as help estimate his or her reading process afterward. We provided the Touch & Read system to 175 students from the first to sixth grade in the regular class and asked them to use it in the lesson for reading comprehension. Analysis of our data shows improvements in the reading rate and accuracy of the children with reading difficulties and a consequent rise in reading scores. Through an analysis of the logs of the reading behavior, the differences of the reading process between the children with and without reading difficulties are discussed here.",>Maiko Takahashi>Mamoru Iwabuchi>Kenryu Nakamura,>Tokyo Woman's Christian University>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0709/index.html
2012,Infant biases in lexical acquisition induced by loosely symmetric reasoning,"Four biases (or constraints) are known to guide word learning by infants: whole object bias, noun-category bias, mutual exclusivity, and shape similarity. They can be understood in relation to manifesting and invalidating the logical types between an object and the class or a token and the type. Hence we can suppose the biases have close connection to self-reference and our flexibility in thinking. Because the biases basically contradict each other, there must be an adjusting mechanism. We propose the loosely symmetric (LS) model as the plausible mechanism. LS, a heuristics describing human symmetric cognitive biases in the form of conditional probability, is shown to be effective in an ample amount of areas including causal induction, learning (reinforcement, supervised and unsupervised), game-theoretical situations and digital game AI. Infant agent inferring what to learn with LS shows not only efficient word learning but also appropriate use of the acquired knowledge for communication. The agent also shows appropriate adjusting of which bias prevails.",>Tatsuji Takahashi>Takumi Kamiya>Takahiro Shimizu>Shuji Shinohara,>Tokyo Denki University>Tokyo Denki University>Tokyo Denki University>Advanced Algorithms & Systems,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0710/index.html

Accordingly, it suggests the importance of face color as a social signal. In our previous study (2009), we found the tendency to typical colors for each emotion: red for anger, bluish colors for sadness, and yellow, orange and pink for joy. In this study, we investigate the color effects on cognition of emotional facial expression in colored schematic faces, which can represent prototypes of emotional facial expression and control the degree of change for each part; eyes and mouth. As a result, consistent colors for each emotional expression facilitated the task performance.",>Fumiyo Takahashi>Yasuhiro Kawabata,">Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, JAPAN>Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, JAPAN",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0711/index.html
2012,Neural substrates of grammatical information retrieval during sentence comprehension,"To comprehend a sentence, retrieval processes of both grammatical and lexical-semantic information from memory are required. However, previous studies had mainly focused on the maintenance process. The current fMRI study investigated the existence of information retrieval process on grammatical and lexical-semantic processing by manipulating retrieval load but by controlling maintenance load. Two tasks have prepared; in the grammatical task participants read ungrammatical Japanese coordination construction sentences and judged in which conjunct incongruent item had appeared, and in the lexical task, the participants remembered six Japanese words and judged when the lastly displayed word appeared. The result showed significant brain activity in the superior part and inferior part of left middle frontal gyrus in the grammatical task and in the lexical task, respectively (p<.001, uncorrected). This indicates the existence of retrieval system independently from maintenance process. In addition, grammatical information retrieval is processed distinctly from lexical-semantic information retrieval.",>Kei Takahashi>Satoru Yokoyama>Toshimune Kambara>Ryuta Kawashima,>Tohoku University>Tohoku University>Tohoku University>Tohoku University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0712/index.html
2012,Soccer as Social Interaction between Observable Bodies,"What is the most essential in soccer is that a player’s orientation as to how s/he is about to play is expressed through bodily movements and becomes observable for other players in the process of game. And, this is not only true for soccer, but also for social interaction in general such as conversation. Therefore, it is indispensable for cognitive science of social interaction to build a methodology for grasping what a participant in interaction observes in other participant’s behaviors in the on-going process of interaction as a starting point for modeling cognitive competence behind such behaviors. This presentation introduces an analytic framework for soccer in which soccer is conceived as a kind of social interaction and bodily movements in it are analyzed with reference to several analytic concepts developed in conversation analysis and gesture studies which can describe details of sequential organization of social interaction.",>Katsuya Takanashi>Kazuki Sekine,>Japan Science and Technology Agency / Kyoto University>Japan Society for Promotion Science / University of Birmingham,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0713/index.html
2012,Tactile sensation and onomatopoeia in Japanese,"This paper explores words of tactile perception in Japanese investigated by using an elicitation task. Japanese language contains a lot of onomatopoeic words and has been focused on its expressiveness. On the other hand, their accuracy in haptic domain has not been often discussed. To examine the role of onomatopoeic words in tactile expression, I have used a task developed by MPI language and perception project (Majid and Levinson 2007) using a texture booklet contains ten different textures. The investigation has been held in a small village among mountains. The equality of their way of life is helpful to avoid over-generalization. Consequently, the number of texture onomatopoeic words is not enough to express tactile sensation accurately: one forth of the token contains onomatopoeic words in contrast to half of expression to try to guess the source in detail. Some onomatopoeic words are used to express more than one stimulus.",>Yufuko Takashima,">Dokkyo University, Soka, Saitama, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0714/index.html
2012,A remotely operated robot as a research tool to study the effects of different roles for successful collaborative learning,"In collaborative learning situations, remotely operated robots can be used to deliver the same information to different groups, so that we can explore the roles of partners in collaboration. Using this technique, we have tested 25 collaborative learning cases with eighty 5th and 6th graders on science topics. Even though the basic script for running these experimental classes was kept constant and the children learned successfully from the first case, we have found that the operators’ behavior changed over the course. For the first nine cases, the robots were operated as “a moderator.” In the following eight cases, the operators mixed this style with operations where the robot acted more like an equally capable peer. Observing some success for soliciting more active collaboration by this mode of operation, in the recent eight cases, the operators have begun to explore different possibilities of “kids” roles.",>Nakayama Takayaro>Ashikaga Jun>Inaba Sho>Iyoki Kenta>Naomi Miyake,>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0715/index.html
2012,The Influence of Cognitive Functions to Acquire Nursing Skills for Patient Transfer,"This study aims to elucidate the influence of cognitive functions on nursing skills for patient transfer. We examined the relationship between Go/No-go task (GNG) performance and self-evaluation score in the nursing care action, magnitude of low back strain during patient transfer, and decision making time for starting patient transfer. Twenty university students (mean age 19±0) participated in this study. The results showed that the reaction times in the GNG was correlated with the magnitude of low back strain and the decision making time. As GNG performance is related to decision making for action selection, this cognitive process appears to be associated with nursing skill. This is observed via the magnitude of low back strain and decision time for better transfer action selection. Thus, cognitive process for selecting the nursing care action may be related to the nursing skills.",>Keiko Takeda>Yoriko Watanabe>Taeko Harada,>Nihon Fukushi University>Seirei Christopher University>Nihon Fukushi University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0716/index.html
2012,The effect of 3D stereoscopic display on spatial cognition: a near-infrared spectroscopy study,"3D stereoscopic displays have become popular in our life. Some studies show that this new technology affects our ability to recognize objects. However, it is not well known how our brain is modulated by the technology. In the current study, eighteen healthy adults participated. They were asked to make blocks same as pictures shown on a monitor. The task was similar to an intelligence test. There were two sets of pictures, 2D and 3D. The stimuli were presented through the Nvidia 3D vision system. During the task, activation in parietal area, which is related to spatial cognition, were recorded by a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Compared to 3D pictures, 2D pictures more activated parietal area. The result indicated that the task with 2D pictures required more spatial cognition to compute depth information of the blocks from 2D pictures, which leads to activation of parietal area.",>Yoshiyuki Tamamiya>Kazuo Hiraki,>University of Tokyo>University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0717/index.html
2012,Understanding displacement of communication by graphical communication tasks,"One important feature of human linguistic communication is “displacement,” to communicate about absent objects. However, it has not been revealed that which aspects of displacement are unique to human beings. We claim that displacement should be considered in the context of communication and distinguished from memory to this end. We designed a graphical communication task for displaced communication based on Fay et al (2003). Two participants are paired and communicate using electric drawing pads in separate rooms. In the experiment, we investigated speakers’ devices on expression to make listeners understand absent objects. We compared two different kinds of tasks one corresponds to displacement based on memory and the other displacement not based on listeners’ experience. The result shows that speakers tend to use placeholders significantly more to express events that are not based on listeners’ experience. Placeholders are alternative expressions that typically have the same features with absent objects.",>Kaori Tamura>Takashi Hashimoto,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0718/index.html
2012,Effect of embodied cognition in insight problem solving,"We confirmed that embodied cognition improves relaxation of the fixation in insight problem solving. In this study, the embodied cognition was manipulated with eye movements in an eye-tracking task. To achieve a solution, a problem solver is required to relax the fixation that guides search in an incorrect problem space, and to shift the search into a correct one. We conducted two experiments. The participants' eye movement was controlled using an eye-tracking task prior to or during insight problem solving. Experiment 1 confirmed that the tracking task performed prior to the insight task reduced the participants' fixation guiding the incorrect search. In Experiment 2, the participants who engaged in the tracking task during solving the insight task found a correct target faster just after beginning to generate crucial hypotheses that violate the incorrect fixation than those who did not. We concluded that a stimulus accompanying embodied cognition affects fixation generation and also reduces the intensity of fixation once generated in insight problem solving.",>Masahiko Tamura>Kazuhisa Miwa,">Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan>Nagoya University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0719/index.html
2012,For female eyes only: Comparing the effects of enlarging eyes and irises on facial attractiveness,"Various beauty products have been developed motivated by our general concern to facial attractiveness. The eyes and irises are quite often the main target of those cosmetic attempts to increase beauty of female faces. Many women use cosmetic items to make eyes look larger, but some Japanese women use contact lenses to make irises look larger. In this research, we compared rated attractiveness of female faces with enlarged eyes and enlarged irises. We also compared those faces in terms of likability and childishness. The result showed that faces with enlarged eyes were rated more attractive, while faces with enlarged irises were perceived more likable and childish. Moreover, female participants evaluated faces with enlarged irises more attractive, though males did not. We suggest that the eye-makeup to enlarge the appearance of irises has the effect of showing the female faces more attractive only for the viewers of the same sex.",>Azumi Tanabe-Ishibashi>Mikina Takahashi>Maya Katsuhara>Kana Kuraguchi>Hiroshi Ashida,">Kyoto University, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto , Japan>Kyoto University, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto , Japan>Kyoto University, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto , Japan>Kyoto University, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto , Japan>Kyoto University, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto , Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0720/index.html

However, taking into account gender difference of playing style preference, it is possible to predict that social abilities differ by gender. In this research to find a gender difference of social behavior in playing with peers, new game based on the Ultimatum Game was constructed. Participants were 9 or 10 years old and played with 3 other same gender peers (one is a friend and two are foes) according to some rules.

For example, nonwords composed of phoneme combinations that occur frequently in a particular language are recalled accurately in a short-term memory task. In this study, we investigated the role of another type of phonological knowledge, prosodic knowledge, which has thus far been neglected. For this purpose, an accent-pattern assignment task with tri-mora nonwords was performed by Japanese speakers of the Kansai dialect under the assumption that the phonological system might assign the typical accent pattern, which reflects accumulated knowledge about accent patterns that occur in the language environment, to non-lexical items. However, the proportion of accent patterns produced did not reflect the frequency of each accent pattern in the Kansai dialect; instead, it reflected the proportion in the Standard Japanese language, to which all Japanese speakers have presumably been exposed by the broadcast media.",>Yuki Tanida>Yoko Higuchi>Yuri Yano>Satoru Saito,">Department of Cognitive Psychology in Education, Kyoto university, Yoshida Hon-machi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan>Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University>Department of Cognitive Psychology in Education, Kyoto university, Yoshida Hon-machi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan>Department of Cognitive Psychology in Education, Kyoto university, Yoshida Hon-machi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0722/index.html

Participant’s experience with the sport was recorded, along with the number, size, and accuracy of saccadic eye-movements made around 'ball events' (i.e. hits and bounces) while watching the clips of tennis match. Overall, observers with richer experience about tennis relocated their eyes quicker and closer to the upcoming event location as compared with observers with relatively poor-experience of the sport. Moreover, even though repeated exposure to the same clips increased the efficiency of eye-movements in non-experienced observers, the main differences (e.g., saccadic amplitudes) between the two observer groups was preserved. Importantly, the influence of experience was predominantly found in ball events with higher uncertainty (bounces). These results suggest that our gaze control system utilizes knowledge accumulated through past experience to anticipate upcoming events, and this helps especially when the visual event that occurs is relatively unpredictable.",>Shuichiro Taya>David Windridge>Magda Osman,">Taisho University>University of Surrey>Queen Mary, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0723/index.html

Then they were tested on the mental rotation into the new orientation between 0° to 180° with the same set of figures (new orientation condition), on the rotation of the upside-down image into the orientation between 180° to 360° with the old figures (novel orientation condition), and on the rotation with the different set of figures (novel figure condition). There was no difference in rotating rate between the novel orientation condition and the novel figure condition. The rotating rate for these conditions was significantly lower than that for the new orientation condition.

The results are summarized as follows. 1) In the real system, the behavioral consistencies within participants were different among three fundamental behaviors (brake, accelerator, and steering). Whereas the consistency of the brake behavior was the lowest, the steering behavior was the highest. 2) The same pattern of consistencies in the real system was confirmed in the virtual and laboratory systems. 3) The pattern of consistencies between the real and virtual systems was similar to the real system.

2012,An Exploration of Crossword Skill,"Past research has established how different lexical skills (word-stem completion, anagram solutions, etc.) correlate with crossword puzzle expertise. However, little is understood about the cognitive processes involved in crossword play. We hypothesize that clues are solved either through an semantic or an orthographic route, but not both simultaneously. To help us test and develop this model, we conducted an initial study examining novice crossword puzzle performance, along with a secondary word-stem completion task. We found that our participants word-stem completion correlated reliably but modestly with puzzle solution, suggesting that a number of other factors may be involved. Moreover, in our study, most responses (66%) were made with little or no orthographic constraints, suggesting that novice crossword players relied heavily on the semantic route for solving clues. The results show evidence for both routes, and provide direction for testing whether a dual-route interactive memory search is possible.",>Kejkaew Thanasuan>Shane Mueller,>Michigan Technological University>Michigan Technological University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0727/index.html
2012,Musical thoughts behind composer's writings,"Two analysis methods were applied to the essays written by Toru Takemitsu and Pierre Boulez, two prominent contemporary composers of classical music. The purpose of the network analysis was to identify keywords and their surrounding words within the text. After applying a morphological analysis to the text, a home-brewed network creation software was employed to create a network for the extracted keywords. There are clearly several node clusters and a number of measures of centrality for the network indicate that the multi-centrality of the keyword space. The text corpus for the essays was then parsed in order to carry out a content analysis at the semantic level. The aim of the content analysis was to extract the structures within the concepts employed by the composers in talking about music. The interesting results include the findings that a) their aesthetic vocabulary is strongly associated to an abstract thinking vocabulary, and b) more ordinary emotion words tend to be associated with lower level music entities. These findings seem to substantiate the layered model of affective processes proposed in our previous report. With methodological perspectives we will argue for the following points; a) Network analysis of the words within a text can provide a better basis for text analysis. b) The modeling of affective process and text analysis may be mutually beneficial.",>Akifumi Tokosumi>Akihiro Kawase,>Tokyo Institute of Technology>National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0728/index.html
2012,Not just for consumers: Data and theory show that context effects are fundamental to decision-making,"Context effects – preference changes depending on the availability of other options – have attracted a great deal of attention among consumer researchers studying high-level decision tasks. Our experiments show that all three context effects from the preferential choice literature – similarity, attraction, and compromise effects – also arise in inference tasks and simple perceptual decision-making tasks. These experiments provide evidence that the effects are not confined to high-level decision tasks where the options have hedonic values such as consumer products. A new model of multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice is also developed. This model, named the Multi-attribute Linear Ballistic Accumulator (MLBA) model, extends the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model (Brown & Heathcote, 2008) and postulates that context effects arise from a combination of cognitive components including attention, a contrast mechanism, and sensitivity to indifference/dominance.

2012,A collinear distractor impairs local element search regardless of its probability occurrence,"Salient distractors draw our attention spontaneously even when they do not facilitate our target search. When that occurs, targets close to or overlapping with them are detected and discriminated faster. However, an opposite impairment effect is observed when the salient distractor is a column of continuous linear bars (Jingling and Tseng, 2012). One possible explanation is that observers optimize their search strategy by directing their attention away from collinear distractors but toward the area where targets are six times more likely to appear. We tested this hypothesis by arranging targets to overlap with collinear distractor columns for 60% of the trials. The same search impairment on targets overlapping with or near the collinear distractor persists, which is against the probability hypothesis. Our result suggests that the origin of this effect is at a sensory processing stage not dependent upon information to its probability occurrence.",>Chia-Huei Tseng>Li Jingling>William Oh,">Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong>Graduate Institute of Neural and Cognitive Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0730/index.html
2012,Can Incubation be efficient in Reviewing?,"By examining eye movements, we reveal an effect of incubation in the reviewing process of creative problem solving. Although previous research on reading comprehension considers eye movements, the reviewing process, an important stage in writing, has not been focused on. We constructed themes with different familiarities and monitored eye movements during the reviewing process on a computer screen to record saccade, fixation, and the degree of attention paid to blank spaces. While recording the reviewing, we focused on distinguished macrostructure changes to compare the quality of texts after incubation-facilitated reviewing. Additionally, we conducted a questionnaire survey on metacognition and a semi-structured interview regarding cognitive strategy in reviewing. We examined the correlations between theme familiarities, metacognition, the quality of reviewed text, and eye movements. We propose an instructional method in writing education to reveal the correlations between the reviewing aspect of complex problem solving and incubation, a semantic cognitive process.",>Mio Tsubakimoto,">Future University Hakodate, Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0731/index.html

However, such initial trials also produce usable constraints that can facilitate further solutions. We used a tangram puzzle (constructing a “T” shape from four pieces) to prepare three conditions: a constraint discovery condition wherein our confederate (acting as a member of paired participants) regularly provided two combined pieces as a hint, a constraint relaxation condition wherein the confederate regularly violated the participant’s constraints on how to place pieces, and a control (natural collaboration) condition. Twenty four participants were divided to one of three conditions. We found no significant difference in the number or average time of successful solutions among the conditions. However, the constraint discovery condition outperformed the other conditions in correctly recalling the solution, indicating that, when people discover usable constraints, they retain them as basic knowledge pieces.",>Syoichi Tsujii>Syoji Hamaguchi>Syota Chimura>Hajime Shirouzu,>Chyukyo University>Chyukyo University>Chyukyo University>Chukyo University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0732/index.html
2012,Heart rate synchronization in collective creative construction tasks,"What does it mean to cooperate? In this paper we explore the effects of cooperation on heart rate. We argue that in cooperative contexts participants synchronize their heart rhythms according to two factors: the affordances of the task at hand and the gradual consolidation of collaborative practices. We instructed 6 groups of participants to construct LEGO models of six abstract notions, both individually and in groups. We employed recurrence analysis techniques to quantify the mutual adaptability of heart rates among the participants in the different tasks. During individual tasks individual heart rates synchronized both within and between groups (but not with controls), plausibly due to the affordances of the task at hand. Additionally, during collective, but not individual tasks, within group synchronization grew over time. We finally discuss how these measures of synchronization relate to the participants’ engagement in the tasks at hand.",>Kristian Tylén>Riccardo Fusaroli,>Aarhus University>Aarhus University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0733/index.html
2012,A Longitudinal Study on the Development of Taiwanese Children’s Use of Causal and Anaphoric Cue,"Making causal connections and anaphoric inference referring expressions is important in forming a coherent discourse representation. Causal inference is central to the representation of reading comprehension. Zero pronoun sentences are grammatical in Mandarin Chinese. Therefore, this longitudinal study focused on the development of inferring causal and anaphoric coherence among elementary school children in Taiwan. In this two-year study, we reported data from 338 children in three age groups: 104 grade second, 123 grade third and 111 grade forth children in the first year. For each subject, 36 experimental short texts and 18 fillers in randomized order were implemented in Experiment Builder. We manipulated causality (high or low) and anaphoric resolutions (overt or zero pronoun) in texts. The patterns in this study indicated the importance of causality for the on-line inferences. There were steady developments of causal and anaphoric inference in three age groups during the study periods.",>Yuhtsuen Tzeng>Chiung-hsien Tsai,>National Chung Cheng University>Chung Hwa University of Medical Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0734/index.html
2012,Measuring Learners' Awareness through Persona-Conjoint Method,"This paper proposes a novel method: ""Persona-Conjoint Method""(PCM), which intends to measure the effect of learning of complex situation in a business process. In practice, such as Case Learning, learners must understand how to act at a specified complex situation, such as marketing negotiations. The method is characterized by 1) a persona-set prepared by an appropriate orthogonal array used in conjoint analysis, and then 2) the measurements for changes of evaluation viewpoints of learners. Therefore, the proposed method is able to quantitatively detect and evaluate learners' awareness about the situations difficult to detect so far. From the learners' experiments, the paper describes experimental results using Manga textbook with narrative approach. The method has revealed a set of alternative personae for the particular character of the narrative material.",>Hikaru Uchida>Akiko Orita>Masaaki Kunigami>Takao Terano>Atsushi Yoshikawa,">Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama-shi, Japan>Keio University,Fujisawa-shi, Japan>Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama-shi, Japan>Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama-shi, Japan>Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama-shi, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0735/index.html
2012,Inhibitory control in event-based prospective memory task: An examination using the retrieval-practice paradigm,"The nature of forgetting in a prospective-memory (PM) task was examined through the retrieval-practice paradigm. In two experiments, participants studied a series of category–exemplar pairs that belonged to one of eight categories (e.g., FRUIT-apple) and then engaged in retrieval practice for three members in each of four categories. At the final test phase, every participant was required to detect target items that belonged to one practiced and one unpracticed category while performing an ongoing task. Results showed the worst detection performance in response to the unpracticed items in the practiced categories versus that in response to the unpracticed items in the unpracticed categories. This retrieval-induced forgetting was smaller for the detection of focal targets, for which the processing largely overlapped with the processing of the ongoing task (Experiment 2), than for non-focal targets, for which the processing was performed independently from that of the ongoing task (Experiment 1).",>Kenta Utsumi>Satoru Saito,">Graduate school of education, Kyoto University>raduate school of education, Kyoto University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0736/index.html
2012,Metacognition in children is specific to domain knowledge,"Metacognitive skills have been shown to facilitate learning. But do they develop globally or within content domains? We used an objective measure of metacognition in two different domains to investigate this question in children. 25 subjects (5 to 8 y.o.) made numerosity judgments (which picture has more dots?) and emotion judgments (which picture looks happier?) on a touchscreen. After each judgment, they placed a metacognitive “bet” on their accuracy using a token economy, with immediate feedback (+3/-3 high risk, +1/-1 low risk). We measured metacognition by a phi correlation of risk choice and accuracy, finding that children were significantly metacognitive on both tasks. Higher metacognitive scores on the numerosity task, and not the emotion task, predicted mathematical intelligence. However, metacognitive scores did not predict other measures of ability, such as general IQ. Our study provides evidence that metacognition develops in tandem with domain-specific knowledge, rather than globally.",>Vy Vo>Rosa Li>Nate Kornell>Jessica Cantlon,">University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States>Duke University, Durham, NC, United States>Williams College, Williamstown, MA, United States>University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0737/index.html
2012,"A study of cognitive style, visual attention distributions and achievement of Web-based multimedia recipes learning","This study aims to explore, based on eye-tracking data, the effect of cognitive style on attention distributions and learning achievement in web-based multimedia recipe learning. The study uses a one way (verbal style V.S. visual style) quasi-experimental design. Subjects are 29 students of hospitality. The treatments of the study multimedia recipes are including static and dynastic representation. Students’ prior knowledge and learning achievement are assessed via a survey. Result of this study reveals that students’ cognitive styles have an intimate relationship with their visual attention distributions in reading wed-based recipes. And gender could play an important role in this learning context. In addition, it shows that it is effective to improve students’ immediate learning achievement and retention of learning when the procedural knowledge of recipes is represented by web-based multimedia. Specifically, the static multimedia materials improve students’ immediate learning achievement while the dynamic multimedia materials improve their retention of learning.",>Ching-Yeh Wang>Meng-Jung Tsai,">Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology>Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0738/index.html

Avatars in video games fit this description but are not embodied in the way generally assumed by EM theory, thus providing an opportunity to test the generality of the hypothesis in a domain that actually invites mental extension of self beyond body boundaries. We compare ERP responses to images of self, own avatar, other avatar, own possessions (real & virtual), and other possessions (real and virtual) after participants have spent three weeks playing both Second Life (avatar designed and directly controlled by player) and Sims 3 (avatar generally configured but not directly controlled). We test the hypotheses that N170 waveforms are distinct for images of the self and of others, while N250 is different for personal possessions and unfamiliar objects and P300 functions as an index of attention to self-relevant stimuli.",>Veronica Weser>Ken Livingston,>Vassar College>Vassar College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0739/index.html
2012,Social information aids accuracy but hinders adaptation,"We introduce a simulated investment task combining a temporally varying ""market"" environment with a 6-armed bandit using heterogeneous payoff distributions. It includes uncertainty about the binary state of the market, as well as which of several options yields the best payoff under each hidden market state. The mean performance of grouped participants (who could view peers' choices) did not change over the course of the session, while isolated participants had lower initial performance but higher final performance than grouped participants. Further analysis showed that grouped participants benefited from relatively accurate but low-risk-biased social information, while isolated participants developed a higher tolerance for ambiguity, reducing their use of costly prediction for high-risk choices more than did grouped participants. Our results imply that social information can cushion individual performance under uncertainty, but may hinder learning and adaptation to a dynamic environment.",>Thomas Wisdom>Keigo Inukai>Wataru Toyokawa>Kameda Tatsuya,">Center for Experimental Research in Social Sciences, Hokkaido University>Department of Economics, Hokkaido University>Department of Behavioral Science, Hokkaido University>Center for Experimental Research in Social Sciences, Hokkaido University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0740/index.html
2012,Searching for something familiar or novel: ERP correlates of top-down attentional selection for specific items and categories,"Visual search is often guided by top-down attentional templates that specify target-defining features. But, search can also occur at the level of object categories. We measured the N2pc component, a marker of attentional target selection, in a visual search task using familiar and novel targets. Targets were defined either categorically (e.g., any letter), or at the feature level (e.g., the letter C). An N2pc was elicited during category search, in both familiar and novel contexts, indicating that even when targets are only defined at the category level, they are selected at early sensory-perceptual stages. However, the N2pc emerged earlier and was larger during feature-based search, demonstrating the superiority of attentional guidance by feature-specific templates. Moreover, category search triggered feature-specific templates, while the inverse was not the case, suggesting that higher-order search templates automatically include lower-order templates.",>Rachel Wu>Gaia Scerif>Richard Aslin>Tim Smith>Martin Eimer,">Birkbeck, University of London>University of Oxford>University of Rochester>Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0741/index.html

2012,Design of motion using mimetic words,"Today, with several media of expression being available, the field of design has come to address more dynamic and impressive objects such as sound and computer graphics. In this study, we attempt to design such a creative and emotional motion that resonates with deep feelings that are difficult to verbalize using mimesis in the Japanese language and we believe that mimetic word is capable of expressing deep feelings. While onomatopoeic (sound-symbolic) words imitate actual sounds, mimetic (reality-symbolic) words, for example, shiku-shiku (sobbing) and kune-kune (wriggling), express appearance, movement, feeling, and other phenomena. We extracted mimetic words which indicate movement from other mimetic words. We showed how using mimetic words can help identify suitable motions that can be combined to create a new creative and emotional motion. This motion can be applied to such elements as animated logos and be used to create appealing advertisements.",>Kaori Yamada>Toshiharu Taura>Yukari Nagai,">Kobe University, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan>Kobe University, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0743/index.html
2012,Stochastic dynamics hidden in Japanese martial arts,"Martial arts like judo or Japanese fencing (kendo) are considered typical interpersonal competitions of human motor behavior. This kind of competition requires one to attack an opponent while simultaneously avoiding the opponent's attack. To quantify the practical behavior of interpersonal distance (IPD) between two players from the viewpoint of a dynamical system, we observed players' movements in kendo matches by a motion capturing system. The participants were twelve college athletes whose team had won in All Japan championships. The time series of the IPD from the coordination phase to the attacking phase was extracted, and 419 scenes were analyzed. A return map analysis was applied to the data using peak detections. We could describe the interpersonal competition during a kendo match in terms of state transitions, as in a Markov process. This suggests that complex human movements in interpersonal competition are self-organized by a simple principle.

2012,A Classification of Manner Adverbs in Korean: A Frame-based Approach,"There have been difficulties in providing a unified account of Korean adverbs. For example, in contrast to English, most manner adverbial expressions in Korean do not occur as adverbial complements to verbs, denying one way to characterize this type of expressions. The aim of this paper is to provide some criteria for classifying and categorizing manner adverbs in Korean based on frames. In the first part of this paper, we lay out the general syntactic position and semantic interpretation of Korean manner adverbs. In the second part, we present a systematic description and classification of manner adverbs using a formal apparatus based on “the Operator and Davidsonian approaches” (Schaefer, 2004). Finally, we propose appropriate frame structures for adverbs of manner, making reference to the Berkeley FrameNet (BFN), which we show are useful in identifying the frame types of manner adverbs and in sub-classifying individual lexical units (esp., verbs) in Korean test data.",>Myung-Jin Yang,>Hankuk University of Foreign Studies,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0745/index.html
2012,Brain activities for different cohesion type on discourse comprehension,"In order to comprehend discourse, the sentences in the discourse should be appropriately combined. What combines two sentences with each other is called “cohesion”. Theoretically, there are four types of cohesion― conjunction, ellipsis, lexical cohesion, and reference. Previous neuroimaging studies investigated brain activities for cohesive and incohesive discourse, but no studies distinguished the types of cohesion. This study compared the brain activities of four cohesion types using fMRI. Participants were asked to read cohesive/incohesive discourses, each of which were combined with one of four types of cohesion, and to judge whether the discourse was coherent or not. There was no significant difference in brain activation among the four cohesion types, suggesting that the different cohesion types are recognized by a common brain mechanism.",>Ken Yasaka>Satoru Yokoyama>Kei Takahashi>Ryuta Kawashima,>Tohoku University>Tohoku University>Tohoku University>Tohoku University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0746/index.html
2012,Ad hoc creature: Lost and added in translation from description to depiction,"When asked to draw a “rabbit”, almost all people can draw a rabbit correctly. In contrast, is it possible that using only descriptions of appearance features of a rabbit could achieve the same task? We prepared a description of rabbit from a dictionary (230 words), and masked “rabbit” in it. The description contains 40 appearance features of rabbit. Then, subjects (n=41) were asked to draw a creature from the description. As the result, the average 15 features (35%; min 2%, max 53%) have appeared in each picture. This indicates that people did not use all of the description to draw the target. Moreover, some people tend to draw undescribed features: a tail (40%), whiskers (10%) and wings (4%). The result suggests that description-to-depiction translation might involve not only bottom-up processing from appearance features of a target, but also top-down processing from an ‘ad hoc creature’ image in mind.",>Sachi Yasuda>Masashi Okamoto>Eiji Aramaki,>The University of Tokyo>Ritsumeikan University>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0747/index.html

However, in literature, there are a lot different claims about the categorization in pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). In present study, we aim to clarify whether, specifically, biological cues would influence non-mental retarded PDD in categorization. We used the short form of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) pertaining with and without biological information to evaluate categorization ability in non-mental retarded PDD and typical developmental subjects. It was found that non-mental retarded PDD have more intact responses for physical categories than biological categories. These results allow us to highlight the patterns of deficits in prototype categorization, conceptualizing social function and accompanied specific category learning of PDD.

2012,Determining people's expectations about the form of causal relationships,"How people make inferences about causal systems with multiple potentially interactive causes is an important but complicated question. We conducted an experiment using a blicket detector task with an iterated-learning design to study people's prior beliefs about functional form. Participants observed stimuli and generated predictions based on their observations. Some of these predictions were then observed by the next participants, ultimately converging on answers that reflect only people's prior beliefs. Our results suggest that people make judgments by balancing a preference for simple causal systems against one for adequately explaining the available data. To explain these results, we propose a novel computational model that features a grammar-based prior, expressing causal relationships as compositions of three atomic forms. This model outperformed one that is based on the noisy-OR and captured people's expectations about such causal systems, suggesting the importance of logical operations~---~disjunction, conjunction, and negation~---~in characterizing people's causal knowledge.",>Saiwing Yeung>Christopher Lucas>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>Carnegie Mellon University>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0749/index.html

2012,Nothing-absence difference in causal induction and the pARIs rule,"In a novel environment, we establish causal relationship by inductive inference from statistical data. Although recent studi es on causal induction focus on causal structure rather than intensity, how we induce the intensity from co-occurrence of an effect and a candidate cause remains important as far as the environment is of novelty. We propose a heuristics for causal induction, the proportion of assumed-to-be rare instances (pARIs), and test its rationale and the descriptive validity. The pARIs rule is based on the rarity assumption that is quite often used in rational analysi s approach (e.g., Oaksford & Chater, 1994) intimately associated with the frame problem. As for the descriptive power, we show that pARIs best fits the experimental results with the highest correlation and the min imum error. In regard to the rationale, we tested how we assume the rarity of the events we focus on. We confirmed that we r igorously distinguish between rare and non-rare events, in spite of their identical status as data.",>Junki Yokokawa>Tatsuji Takahashi,>Tokyo Denki University>Tokyo Denki University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0751/index.html

Yet there are few studies which examine the relationship between proficiency levels and processing speeds. In the present study, I looked at how the English proficiency test scores of 35 Japanese learners related to the speed at which the learners processed written English sentences. The results showed a statistically robust correlation between listening test scores and the processing speed of sentences which subjects read (p < 0.05), but not between reading test scores and general processing speed (p = 0.5). These results indicate that the reading speed of sentences in a foreign language is strongly related to listening proficiency, which proceeds to suggests that reading speed in a foreign language can be used as one index of listening proficiency.",>Satoru Yokoyama,>Tohoku University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0752/index.html
2012,Toward a history-sensitive description of syntactic development,"Under the empiricist theory of language acquisition known as Usage-based Model it is assumed that the process of acquisition is gradual, from concrete to abstract; infants’ representation of grammatical knowledge is considered to be ""acquired"" in bottom-up fashion. This view is compatible with recent, that is, non-traditional, theories of machine learning such as connectionist models, and therefore it can be said to have a plausibility at least from a computational point of view. At the same time, however, descriptive plausibility should be achieved. In this study, an innovative method called History-Sensitive Description (HSD) is presented in order to describe the development in the usage-based fashion. This method utilizes the history of the utterances by one infant to describe the current knowledge state of the infant. HSD gives us a set of representation at any moment of development if a longitudinal data is given.",>Masato Yoshikawa,>Keio University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0753/index.html

Writing an essay with a complex context requires a high level of language skills, especially in foreign languages. This paper describes the basic principles of Pictogram Network and proposes a novel support method for peer review activities for English as a foreign language composition education. When applying the method to the composition learning, the learners are required to select pictograms from the provided list and link them in order to convey the main purport of their essays. The results will not be affected by inessential factors such as spelling errors and trifling grammatical or syntax errors. Therefore, ambiguities of the context about the composition topics will become clearer than in the conventional method. The proposed method also helps to indicate illogicality of the context in writings, and will be useful even in multi-lingual environment.",>Sayuri Yoshizawa-Watanabe>Masaaki Kunigami>Satoshi Takahashi>Atsushi Yoshikawa>Takao Terano,">Hoshi University>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology>The Japan Institute for Educational Measurement, Inc.>Tokyo Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0754/index.html
2012,Preschoolers Use Timing of Causal Actions as a Cue for Categorization,"This study examined how children’s categorization is influenced by adults’ social cues, particularly whether adults performed causal actions before or after a sorting demonstration. In Experiment 1, preschoolers saw the experimenter sort toys with different surface features (colors) and causal properties (sound produced when shaken) into two boxes. When the experimenter shook the toy to produce a sound before sorting (shake-first condition), children were more likely to later categorize the toys based on sound. However, when the experimenter performed the same shaking action after sorting (shake-last condition), children were more likely to sort the toys by color. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that children in the shake-first condition continued to categorize a new set of toys by sound, and they did so even in free play. These results suggest that children use adult’s cues—in particular, the timing of adults’ causal actions—to determine whether causal properties are relevant for categorization.",>Yue Yu>Tamar Kushnir,>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0755/index.html
2012,The Rhetoric of Defamiliarization for Narrative Generation using the Constraints in a Conceptual Dictionary,"Through an analysis of advertising rhetoric, we have acquired an idea that much of the interestingness in advertising works are be grounded on the rhetoric of defamiliarization for the components. The defamiliarization is originally a literary idea which was proposed by Shklovskii and Brecht and means a literary technique for changing a familiar object into unfamiliar one to reinforce the impression. For example, the impression of a familiar product is reinforced by the application of defamiliarization techniques to the objects and agents. This idea will be able to generalize to narratives other than the advertising narrative. In this paper, we summarize the techniques for operating the level of single event by the defamiliarization rhetoric combined with a conceptual dictionary for noun concepts and verb concepts. The techniques have twelve types including three types of regular rhetoric and other irregular rhetoric. The latter transforms the elements like action, actor, product (object) and location in an event into strange or preposterous things. In our integrated narrative generation system in which this module is incorporated, this function is associated with a mechanism to be able to flexibly adjust a variety of generation from realistic narratives to fantastical narratives.",>Yike Zhang>Junpei Ono>Takashi Ogata,">Graduate School of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University>Graduate School of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University>Faculty of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0756/index.html

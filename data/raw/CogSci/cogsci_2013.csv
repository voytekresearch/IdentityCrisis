2013,Diagrammatic Cognition: Discovery and Design,"External representations of thought—maps, diagrams, sketches, and the like—are ancient inventions that serve thought and communication in numerous ways. A number of cognitive scientists have investigated roles these representations play in cognition (see, e.g., Donald, 1991; Larkin & Simon, 1987; Norman, 1993; Schön, 1983). They are created and used by school students, by architects and designers, by mathematicians and scientists, by musicians, dancers, and artists. People design and use diagrams to spatialize thought and make it public, to work through ideas and clarify thinking, to reduce working memory load, to communicate ideas to others, to promote collaborative work by providing an external representation that can be pointed to and animated by gestures and collectively revised. Considerable research has shown that well-designed diagrams promote thought, creativity, discovery, and communication. Diagrams can map abstract thought to space, allowing spatial reasoning to promote abstract reasoning.",>William Bechtel,>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0001/index.html
2013,Using Mechanical Turk and PsiTurk for Dynamic Web Experiments,"This half-day workshop will demonstrate how to build custom web-based experiments that rely on participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Attendees will learn how to deploy web-based experiments using PsiTurk, a Python-based platform that simplifies the process of setting up experiments and interacting with AMT. No prior knowledge about AMT is necessary, but participants are encouraged to download and set up the PsiTurk platform before attending the workshop if they would like to follow along during the demonstration. The workshop will also discuss the benefits and drawbacks of running experiments online and address concerns about the quality of data obtained via AMT or other web-based services.",>Anna Coenen>Doug Markant>Jay B.

2013,"Embodied Approaches to Interpersonal Coordination: Infants, Adults, Robots, and Agents","Interpersonal interaction, especially in face-to-face circumstances, requires coordination (Clark, 1996). This involves many subtle behaviors, controlled carefully in the context of another person, from eye movements and gestures, to choice of words and beyond. Several new directions have pursued this microstructure of interpersonal interaction. First, with advances in sensing and computing techniques, we have the capability to process visual, audio and other sensory data collected from real-world interactions. Second, researchers in developmental robotics have investigated mechanisms of interpersonal coordination, to model and implement social systems. Third, research on virtual agents has developed new models of embodied human-agent interaction. Together these strands of research offer new insight into human social dynamics, and the means to implement and test theories in robotics and virtual agents. Bringing them together in one workshop is an opportunity to convey these new methods, and find shared interests and synergies among different approaches and different fields.",>Rick Dale>Chen Yu>Yukie Nagai>Moreno Coco>Stefan Kopp,">University of California, Merced>Indiana University>Osaka University>University of Edinburgh>Universität Bielefeld",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0003/index.html
2013,Interactive Panel Discussion: Professional advancement through real and virtual international collaboration,"The goal of Women in Cognitive Science (WICS) is to increase attention to the situation of women cognitive scientists, to better understand the reasons for existing problems of under representation in key positions, and to provide a forum for professional development that encourages both junior and senior male and female scientists to consider the ways in which they might work with their own home institutions to effect change. The CSS 2013 interactive panel discussion will bring together American and European researchers in Cognitive Science to discuss national and international collaborations as a tool toward professional advancement and visibility and why this is important to one's career development. Invited speakers include R. Harald Baayen (Eberhard Karls University, Tübingen), Melody Dye (Indiana University, Bloomington), Pernille Hemmer (Rutgers University), Lael Schooler (Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin), Anne Warlaumont, (University, of California, Merced). Speakers will describe and contrast varied ways to initiate and goals for international and virtual collaborations. *Laurie Feldman will serve as moderator.",>Laurie Beth Feldman>Janet van Hell>Judith Kroll>Suparna Rajaram>Natasha Tokowicz,">University at Albany, SUNY>Pennsylvania State University>Pennsylvania State University>Stony Brook University>University of Pittsburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0004/index.html
2013,Workshop Proposal: PRE-CogSci 2013: Bridging the gap between cognitive and computational approaches to reference,"Reference is a key mechanism in human communication which has long been studied in different areas of Cognitive Science. The PRE-CogSci 2013 workshop, which focusses on the production/generation of referring expressions, follows in the footsteps of two earlier CogSci workshops in seeking to forge closer links between the approaches that are associated with the different disciplines, with special attention to psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. Peer-reviewed contributions on all aspects of the production/generation of referring expressions are solicited. Special themes of the workshop will include: (1) Collaborative reference, (2) Nondeterminism in production, (3) Interaction between comprehension and production, and (4) Combinations with research in vision. There will be invited presentations by Herb Clark and by Noah Goodman.",>Albert Gatt>Roger van Gompel>Ellen Gurman Bard>Emiel Krahmer>Kees van Deemter,>University of Malta>University of Dundee>University of Edinburgh>Tilburg University>University of Aberdeen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0005/index.html
2013,Motivations and Goals in Developing Integrative Models of Human Cognition,"There has been tremendous growth recently in theories that attempt to provide more comprehensive accounts of the foundational mechanisms of human cognition. Such theories have taken a variety of forms, and have focused on different levels of analysis. The diversity is important and necessary, but can serve as a barrier to interaction, comparison, and integration, even at venues like the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society that should foster such dialogue. This workshop is intended to bring together individuals working on integrative models of human cognition, to emphasize shared motivations and goals. Ultimately, building scientific communities that bridge levels of analysis, methodologies, and theoretical approaches to work toward more comprehensive theories will be critical to the addressing the central goal of the Cognitive Science Society – understanding the nature of the human mind.",>Glenn Gunzelmann,>Air Force Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0006/index.html
2013,Deception as a Social Strategy,"Deception can be advantageous to a deceiver when the truth conflicts with his or her goals - be they personal or social, selfless or selfish. Thus it is that people regularly use deception to avoid conflict with others, to avoid punishment or embarrassment, to fit into a group, to harm, protect or help others, and for material or non-material benefit to themselves. While there are many ways in which people can deceive, for example, by choosing to fabricate rather than to tell a half-truth, there are always cost-benefit trade-offs, regardless of the strategy a person chooses. Understanding why people deceive in everyday life situations, how they do it, why they choose one strategy over another, and why sometimes they might choose not to deceive at all, even in the absence of any serious anticipated cost, will enable us to build richer models of socially intelligent behavior--models that could be employed in computational systems designed to facilitate enterprises such as elder care, tutoring, and professional training. In this workshop, we aim to address three basic questions: (1) what factors lead people to deceive? (2) what makes them decide to deceive one way rather than another? and (3) how can we model these factors computationally?",>Swati Gupta>Tei Laine>Kayo Sakamoto,">Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore>Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore>Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0007/index.html

2013,When eye see you: Gaze and joint attention in human interaction,"Gaze behavior provides fundamental mechanisms for sharing mental states such as goals and desires and helps to ground communicative content. Responding to or leading someone's gaze to a location or an object of interest thus may result in a situation of joint attention -- a referential triad between two individuals and an entity in the environment. Since people often look at what they attend to and where they intend to act, joint attention is considered fundamental to an understanding of other minds and the interaction with them. This workshop aims to explore how traditionally separate research areas such as social cognition/neuroscience, psycholinguistics, human-computer interaction and developmental psychology contribute to an understanding of the general phenomenon of gaze-following and joint attention from different perspectives -- and how these fields can benefit and learn from each other, e.g. by comparing different approaches and methodologies.",>Maria Staudte>Ulrich Pfeiffer,>Saarland University>University Hospital Cologne,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0009/index.html
2013,Using Complex Network Analysis in the Cognitive Sciences,The general format of the tutorial will be a half-day introduction to research in the field of complex network analysis followed by a more detailed study of a specific research project on language acquisition. In the course of the more detailed study participants will have an opportunity to perform some statistical and hypothesis testing on networks while learning interpretations and meaning of network analysis techniques.,>Nicole Beckage>Michael Vitevitch>Alexander Mehler>Eliana Colunga,">University of Colorado Boulder>University of Kansas>Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main>University of Colorado Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0010/index.html
2013,A General Purpose Architecture for Building Spiking Neuron Models of Biological Cognition,"We have recently created the world's largest biologically realistic brain model that is capable of performing tasks (Eliasmith et al., 2012). This model uses 2.5 million spiking neurons, takes visual input from a 28x28 pixel visual field, and controls a physically modelled arm. By presenting different visual inputs, the model can perform eight different tasks, including memorizing and writing a list of numbers, single-digit addition via counting, and flexible pattern completion in the Raven's Matrices task. This tutorial is meant to introduce the software toolkit and theoretical background that would allow other researchers to build their own models using the same architecture, allowing them to explore other tasks and brain functions. This tool supports a novel cognitive architecture (SPA; the Semantic Pointer Architecture) that directly connects neuroscience with cognitive science.",>Chris Eliasmith>Terrence Stewart,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0011/index.html
2013,Virtual Humans: A New Toolkit for Cognitive Science Research,"Virtual humans (VHs) are digital anthropomorphic characters that exist within virtual worlds but are designed to perceive, understand and interact with real-world humans. Although typically conceived as practical tools to assist in a range of application (e.g., HCI, training and entertainment), the technology is gaining interest as a methodological tool for studying human cognition. VHs not only simulate the cognitive abilities of people, but also many of the embodied and social aspects of human behavior more traditionally studied in fields outside of cognitive science. By integrating multiple cognitive capabilities (e.g., language, gesture, emotion, and the control problems associated with navigating and interacting with a simulated virtual world) and requiring these processes to support real-time interactions with people, VHs create a unique and challenging environment within which to develop and validate cognitive theories. In this tutorial, we will review recent advances in VH technologies, demonstrate examples of use of VHs in cognitive science research and provide hands on training using our Virtual Human Toolkit (http://vhtoolkit.ict.usc.edu/).",>Jonathan Gratch>Arno Hartholt>Morteza Dehghani>Stacy Marsella,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0012/index.html
2013,Making Robust Classification Decisions: Constructing and Evaluating Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs),"Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs) are a quintessential family of simple heuristics that allow effective and efficient binary classification decisions and often perform remarkably well when compared to more complex methods. This half-day tutorial will familiarize participants with examples of FFTs and elucidate the theoretical link between FFTs and signal detection theory (SDT). A range of presentations, practical exercises and interactive tools will enable participants to construct and evaluate FFTs for different data sets.

2013,Half Day Tutorial on Using Quantum Probability Theory to Model Cognition,"This tutorial introduces why and how to build cognitive models using quantum probability (QP) theory. In the tutorial, we will show that QP is inherently consistent with deeply rooted psychological conceptions and intuitions. It offers a fresh conceptual framework for explaining some puzzling empirical findings of cognition, and provides a rich new source of alternative formal tools, compared to classical probability (CP) theory, for cognitive modeling.",>Emmanuel Pothos>Zheng Wang>Jerome Busemeyer,>City University London>The Ohio State University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0014/index.html
2013,Types and states: Mixture and hidden Markov modelling for the cognitive sciences,"The objective of this tutorial is to provide participants with an accessible introduction to mixture models (MMs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs) and the necessary skills to apply them in their own research. These models are particularly useful to analyse aspects of cognition which are best understood in terms of discrete types and states (e.g., when people are expected to apply distinct strategies when performing a task). MMs and HMMs allow one to extract such types/states even when they are not known exactly beforehand. We will provide an intuitive introduction to the underlying theory of MMs and HMMs and will show how to apply the models in practice using freely available software. Throughout the tutorial, the techniques are illustrated with real data relevant to a cognitive science audience. Participants are encouraged to bring their laptop to follow the examples and apply the techniques to their own data.",>Maarten Speekenbrink>Ingmar Visser,>University College London>University of Amsterdam,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0015/index.html
2013,Dynamic Field Theory: Conceptual Foundations and Applications in the Cognitive and Developmental Sciences,"Dynamical Field Theory (DFT) offers a framework for thinking about representation-in-the-moment in neural systems and changes in thinking over learning and development. Dynamic Neural Fields are formalizations of how neural populations represent the continuous dimensions that characterize perceptual features, movements, and cognitive decisions. DFT has been used across a variety of contexts including studies of working memory, word learning, executive function, and autonomous robotics. One obstacle for researchers wishing to use DFT has been that the mathematical and technical skills required to make these concepts operational are not part of the standard repertoire of cognitive scientists. The goal of this tutorial is to provide the training and tools to overcome this obstacle. We will provide a systematic introduction to the central concepts of DFT and their grounding in both Dynamical Systems concepts and neurophysiology. We will provide all needed background and give participants hands-on experience using interactive simulators in MATLAB.",>John Spencer>Gregor Schoener>Yulia Sandamirskaya,">University of Iowa>Ruhr-University, Bochum, Germany>Ruhr-University, Bochum, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0016/index.html
2013,How to Analyze Verbal Protocols,"This tutorial will support researchers who consider using, or have already collected, verbal protocols as data. After discussing the extent to which language can be useful to identify cognitive processes and principles, we will examine each step of the process from data collection via transcription, analysis, and triangulation. The main emphasis will lie on the systematic analysis of linguistic choices, aiming to identify indicators for specific cognitive phenomena that are of interest for the research purpose at hand. Participants are encouraged to contribute actively to this tutorial by bringing ideas and samples from their own research, pertaining to each step of the research process. Email-based communication in advance of the tutorial will ensure a lively and highly interactive tutorial, supporting ongoing research in a practical way rather than theorizing about potential benefits.",>Thora Tenbrink,>Bangor University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0017/index.html
2013,Computational complexity analysis for cognitive scientists,"Many computational- or rational-level models of cognition postulate computations that appear to be computationally intractable (e.g., NP-hard or worse). Formally, this means that the postulated computations consume an exponential amount of time. Informally, this means that the postulated computations do not scale in any obvious way to explain how the modeled cognitive capacities can operate in the real world outside the lab. This problem of intractability is quite common in cognitive science. It is observed in practically all domains of cognition, including, for instance, perception, language, reasoning, categorization, decision-making, and motor planning. It is also not specific to any particular class of models, as it can arise for symbolic, connectionist, probabilistic (e.g. Bayesian), dynamical, logic-based, and even heuristic models of cognition.",>Iris van Rooij>Johan Kwisthout>Mark Blokpoel>Todd Wareham,">Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Memorial University of Newfoundland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0018/index.html
2013,Progress in Joint Action Research,"Joint action is an increasingly popular topic in Cognitive Science. This popularity reflects a recent theoretical trend of postulating, in one way or another, that human perception, action, and cognition are geared to enable successful coordination and communica¬tion with others. The speakers in the symposium will provide an overview of current progress in joint action research. Their contributions will address a wide range of phenomena ranging from tight temporal coordination to shared planning and discourse processes. Together, the contributions will illustrate that social constraints affect cognitive processing in a deeper sense than the more traditional notion of specific modules for social perception and social reasoning would suggest.",>Susan E.

2013,Language and Gesture Evolution,"In humans, gestural communication is closely intertwined with language: adults perform a variety of manual gestures, head movements and body postures while they are talking, children use gestures before they start to speak, and highly conventionalized sign systems can even replace spoken language. Because of this role of gestures for human com-munication, theories of language evolution often propose a gestural origin of language. In searching for the evolutionary roots of language, a comparative approach is often used to investigate whether any precursors to human language are also present in our closest relatives, the great apes, because of our shared phylogenetic history. Therefore, the aim of this symposium is to present recent progress in the field of language evolution from both a developmental and compa-rative perspective and to discuss the question if and to what extent a comparison with nonhuman primates is suitable to shed light on possible scenarios of language evolution.",>Joseph Call>Susan Goldin-Meadow>Cat Hobaiter>Katja Liebal>Michael Tomasello,">Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology>University of Chicago>School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St. Andrews>Department of Education and Psychology, Freie Universität Berlin>Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0020/index.html
2013,New Frameworks of Rationality,"The nature and extent of human rationality is an issue of ongoing debate. In the last two decades, this debate has been enlivened by the development and application of new theoretical frameworks. These include Bayesian notions of adjusting and using uncertain beliefs in an inductive manner as well as deductive probability-based logics as normative guidelines against which to weigh human judgments and decisions; the notion of ecological rationality based on lean and frugal heuristics well adapted to the structure of the environment; the notion of meta-cognitive myopia according to which people are accurate and sensitive in the processing the information in a given sample of observations, but are blind and naive to the history and validity of the sampled data; and game theory.",>Nick Chater>Klaus Fiedler>Gerd Gigerenzer>Karl Christoph Klauer>Mike Oaksford>Keith Stenning,">University of Warwick, Coventry, UK>Universität Heidelberg>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Universität Freiburg>Birkbeck College London>University of Edinburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0021/index.html
2013,Mechanistic Developmental Process: Rumelhart Prize Symposium in Honor of Linda Smith,"Traditional views of cognition, cognitive development, and word learning have viewed knowledge as divorced from processes of perceiving and acting. Linda Smith has championed a dynamic, mechanistic, and processoriented view of cognition and focused on questions of development. She has shown how knowledge is embedded in, distributed across, and inseparable from the processes of perceiving and acting in the world. In so doing, she has enabled a new understanding of the nature of cognition and of how new ways of thinking come to be. This Rumelhart symposium in her honor illustrates how this focus on developmental process changes the questions asked and our resulting understanding of cognition. The five speakers will examine the developmental process of word learning from different vantage points ranging from perceptual to social to cognitive, and spanning multiple periods from the first words to rapid vocabulary growth to the building of semantic networks.",>Larissa K.

2013,Glushko Dissertation Prize Symposium,"The Annual Glushko Dissertation Prize in Cognitive Science was established in 2011 as a way to promote future growth in cognitive science, and encourage students to engage in interdisciplinary efforts to understand minds. The prize is jointly sponsored by the Cognitive Science Society and the Robert J. Glushko and Pamela Samuelson Foundation, and honors young researchers conducting ground breaking research in cognitive science. The immediate goal is to recognize outstanding efforts to bridge between the areas that impinge on cognitive science and create theories of general interest to the multiple fields concerned with scientifically understanding the nature of minds and intelligent systems. Encouraging junior researchers to engage in these enterprises is one of the best ways to assure a robust future for cognitive science. The overarching goal is to promote a unified cognitive science, consistent with the belief that understanding how minds work will require the synthesis of many different empirical methods, formal tools, and analytic theories. This symposium showcases the PhD research projects of the 2013 winners of the Glushko Dissertation Prizes. 2013 marks the first year that a symposium has been formed to assemble and showcase Glushko Prize winners’ research. The prize-winning projects involve research on linguistic compositionality, understanding pictorial narratives, learning object-to-name mappings from complex environments, spatial problem solving, and visual awareness. The recruited research methods include neuroimaging, computational modeling, formal linguistic modeling, corpus analysis, psychological experiments, and theoretical analysis. Taken as a whole, the research projects strongly reinforces the view that contemporary cognitive science research is highly diverse, rigorous, creative, and fertile.",>Douglas Knox Bemis>Neil Cohn>George Kachergis>Andrew Lovett>Robert L.

2013,Communicative Intentions in the Mind/Brain,"The nature of intentions is a perpetual locus of interest for investigators of the human mind. Both occidental and oriental philosophical traditions treat intentions as the root of behavior; and many possible classifications have been offered in order to try to systematize the different types of intention. Moreover, recognition of intentions in others appears to be central to child development, and necessary for becoming a competent member of the society. Recent work in the social neurosciences has focused, in particular, on social intentions, which may underpin the human predisposition toward joint, collaborative behavior. Communicative intentions are particularly central, yet have a puzzling recursive form.",>Bruno Bara>Nick Chater>Michael Tomasello>Rosemary Varley,">Center for Cognitive Science, Univ Torino, Torino, Italy>Warwick Business School>Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig>University College London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0024/index.html
2013,Exploring Cognitive Diversity Across Disciplines and Cultures,"Since the cognitive revolution, a widely held assumption has been that—whereas content may vary across cultures—cognitive processes would be universal, especially those on the more basic levels. Even if scholars do not fully subscribe to this assumption, they often conceptualize, or tend to investigate, cognition as if it were universal (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). The insight that universality must not be presupposed but scrutinized is now gaining ground, and cognitive diversity has become one of the hot (and controversial) topics in the field (Norenzayan & Heine, 2005). We argue that, for scrutinizing the cultural dimension of cognition, taking an anthropological perspective is invaluable, not only for the task itself, but for attenuating the home-field disadvantages that are inescapably linked to cross-cultural research (Medin, Bennis, & Chandler, 2010).",>Andrea Bender>Sieghard Beller>Daniel Haun>Cristine Legare>Asifa Majid>Bethany Ojalehto>Douglas Medin,">University of Freiburg, Germany>University of Paderborn, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany>University of Texas at Austin>Center for Language Studies, Radboud University Nijmegen>Department of Psychology, Northwestern University>Department of Psychology, Northwestern University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0025/index.html
2013,"What if? Counterfactual reasoning, pretense, and the role of possible worlds","Counterfactual thinking, where one envisions alternative pos- sible events and their outcomes, is hypothesized to be one of the primary ways in which we reason about causal relation- ships (e.g., Pearl, 2000; Woodward, 2003). Recent compu- tational and experimental work suggests that both adults and children may reason about causality in a manner consistent with probabilistic graphical models – coherent, complex rep- resentations of causal structure that allow distinctive kinds of inferences (e.g., Gopnik et al., 2004; Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2009). In particular, the causal models approach supports and distinguishes two types of inferences, predictions, on the one hand, and interventions, including counterfactual inter- ventions, on the other. In predictions, we take what we think is true now as a premise and then use the model to calculate what else will be true. In counterfactuals, we take some value of the model that we currently think is not true as a premise, and calculate what would follow if it were.",>Daphna Buchsbaum>Caren Walker>Alison Gopnik>Nick Chater>David Danks>Christopher Lucas>Charles Kemp>Eva Rafetseder>Josef Perner,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of Warwick>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>University of Salzburg>University of Salzburg",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0026/index.html

2013,Sequential Sampling Models Representing a Unifying Framework of Human Decision Making,"Sequential sampling models have been applied for describing the cognitive processes underlying various psychological processes such as memory, perception, or value-based decision making. They share the common assuming that people accumulate information stochastically over time and once the accumulated information passes a decision boundary a response is made. Depending on the cognitive domain the models differ in the specific nature of the accumulation process. In particular, they differ in their assumption about what type of information is processed, how the information is represented, and how the boundary is defined.",>Jerome Busemeyer>Adele Diederich>Andrew Heathcote>Antonio Rangel>Jörg Rieskamp>Marius Usher,>Indiana University>Jacobs University>University of Newcastle>California Institute of Technology>University of Basel>University of Tel Aviv,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0028/index.html
2013,Multiword Sequences as Building Blocks for Language: Insights into First and Second Language Learning,"Many grammatical frameworks view words and rules as the basic building blocks of language, with multiword sequences being treated as peripheral exceptions in the form of idioms, etc.. The new millennium, however, has seen a shift toward construing multiword sequences not as linguistic rarities but as important building blocks for language acquisition and processing. Based on a growing bulk of evidence of sensitivity to multiword sequences in language learning and use, multiword sequences have come to figure prominently in many current approaches to language, including item-based learning, formulaic language, usage-based language processing, and chunk-based learning. This symposium brings together experts from these different approaches to language to explore the idea that first and second language learners differ with respect to their ability to use multiword building blocks to learn and process language, and that this difference affects learning strategies and outcomes.",>Morten H.

2013,Distributed remembering in a social context: Effects of communicating a shared past on what is remembered,"Remembering frequently involves collaboration among two or more individuals, often taking the form of a conversation. In some conversations, one person conveys new information to another, as when a daughter announces to her mother that she is engaged. In other conversations, two people talk to each other about a shared past, as when a couple reminisce about the evening on which they became engaged. The later instance has the potential to shape both what emerges in the discussion, as when one participant scaffolds the remembering of the other. It also has the potential to reshape how participants might subsequently remember the material, with the possibility that the memories of the participants will become more similar. In other words, what people remember is, in part, the result of how they jointly recount the past with others. Yet, despite the critical contribution of joint conversational remembering to memory, detailed study of this phenomenon is only beginning to be undertaken. The objective of this symposium is to bring together several strands of research that explores conversational, or, more generally, communicative influences on memory. The speakers offer a range of different approaches. Dr. Stone explores how public speeches can induce forgetting as well as reinforce memories across a large population and thereby promote a mnemonic convergence through a single social interaction. Dr. Echterhoff considers the role of motivation in moderating conversational influences. Dr. Coman investigates whether these conversational influences propagate across large networks of individuals and can thereby promote a mnemonic convergence. Dr. Edelson examines the neuroscience underlying memory conformity. And Dr. Michaelian engages the philosophical underpinning of the concept of collective memory. In a short summation, Dr. Hirst places these papers in the larger context of social aspects of memory and moderates further discussion.",>Alin Coman>Gerald Echterhoff>Micah Edelson>William Hirst>Kourken Michaelian>Charles Stone,">Princeton University>University of Muenster>Weizmann Institute>New School for Social Research, New York, NY, United States>Bilkent University>Catholic University of Leuven",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0030/index.html
2013,Beyond Synchrony: Complementarity and Asynchrony in Joint Action,"A widespread and powerful model of socially interactive behavior is ‘synchrony’ (Jirsa & Kelso, 2004): Numerous studies have thus recently indicated how individuals through social interaction become increasingly entrained on multiple levels from physiology to syntax: through interaction people synchronize their heart rates, their subtle postural sways, their gestures and gaze behaviors, align their lexicon and their syntax. However, emerging scholarship is increasingly attending to many instances in which patterns of complementary and asynchronous actions rather than synchronous ones seem to predict high levels of interpersonal coordination and joint performance.

The past decade has seen a resurgence of work using computational methods to understand, manipulate, generate, and leverage narratives. This symposium, which is held in association with the Fourth International Workshop on Computational Models of Narrative (CMN'13), a satellite event of CogSci 2013, will focus on aspects of the scientific and computational understanding of narrative that intersect with cognitive science. The speakers and moderators are drawn from diverse fields including cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computational linguistics, and the humanities, and they will focus on a variety of topics including: narrative and its role in analogy, education, and persuasion; challenges in the representation of syntax, discourse, and semantics of narrative; psychological and neuropsychological aspects of narrative; and the growing integration of computational models of narrative in humanities research.",>Mark Finlayson>Bernhard Fisseni>Dedre Gentner>Richard Gerrig>Benedikt Loewe>Jeffrey Loewenstein>Inderjeet Mani>Jan Christoph Meister>R.

2013,Structured cognitive representations and complex inference in neural systems,"The dream of cognitive neuroscience has always been a seamless integration of cognitive representations with neural machinery, but---despite decades of work---fundamental gaps remain. Part of the problem is that many contemporary theories of cognition are formulated in terms of representations and computations that are quite different from those used in computational neuroscience. Bridging this gap requires more than simply a translation between theoretical concepts in the two fields; what is needed is a more radical updating of neuroscience's theoretical vocabulary.",>Samuel Gershman>Joshua Tenenbaum>Alexandre Pouget>Matthew Botvinick>Peter Dayan,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of Geneva>Princeton University>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0033/index.html
2013,Cognitive Foundations of Cultural Learning,"The ability to learn from others is integral to sustaining and transmitting human culture. What are the cognitive processes that support imitative and collaborative cultural learning? How does cultural learning contribute to group dynamics, such as cohesion and conflict? Recent research has focused on how children acquire instrumental skills through causal inference (Call, Carpenter, & Tomasello, 2005; Whiten, McGuigan, Marshall-Pescini, & Hopper, 2009). However, children also need to acquire the norms and conventions of their culture, as well as an understanding of cooperative behavior, to become full-fledged members of their community. This acquisition begins early in ontogeny and is likely reliant on a unique mix of causal reasoning and affiliative goals, triggered by the nature of the action sequence itself and a variety of social cues. In this symposium, we consider the emerging experimental literature on the development of imitation and collaboration with the goal of applying this work to broader issues of group dynamics and the transmission of culture. Henderson will consider the understanding of collaborative goals in infancy. Kenward will consider the normative basis of young children’s over-imitation. Watson-Jones will examine affiliative motivations underlying children’s imitation. Whitehouse will consider how ritualized, normative behavior and cognition impacts group dynamics of coordination and social cohesion.",>Annette Henderson>Ben Kenward>Rachel Watson-Jones>Cristine Legare>Harvey Whitehouse,>The University of Auckland>Uppsala University>The University of Texas at Austin>The University of Texas at Austin>University of Oxford,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0034/index.html
2013,Constraints on Bayesian Explanation,"The hypothesis that human cognition may be well characterized as a set of Bayesian computations has been the topic of considerable debate over the last two decades. Recently, critics have argued that this hypothesis is either unlikely to be true or otherwise too unconstrained to be particularly useful for explaining cognition (e.g., Bowers & Davis, 2012), whereas proponents have defended their position by stating that the Bayesian perspective has been misunderstood, is not necessarily in conflict with other perspectives on cognition, and can still be explanatorily useful as a framework for cognitive science even if under-constrained in many ways (e.g., Griffiths, Chater, Norris, & Pouget, 2012).

2013,Global Change and Cognition,We are living in a period of considerable global change. From climate change to peak oil we are facing multiple challenging problems that need to be managed carefully and wisely.

2013,Is perception cognitively penetrable? A philosophically satisfying and empirically testable reframing,"The question of whether perception can be penetrated by cognition is in the limelight again. The reason this question keeps coming up is that there is so much at stake: Is it possible to have theory-neutral observation? Is it possible to study perception without recourse to expectations, context, and beliefs? What are the boundaries between perception, memory, and inference (and do they even exist)? Are findings from neuroscience that paint a picture of perception as an inherently bidirectional and interactive process relevant for understanding the relationship between cognition and perception?",>Gary Lupyan>Dustin Stokes>Fiona Macpherson>Rasha Abdel Rahman>Robert Goldstone,">University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA>University of Utah>University of Glasgow>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0037/index.html
2013,Informavores: Active information foraging and human cognition,"Unlike a passive sponge floating in a sea of information, humans are active information foragers -- informavores -- who gather and consume new knowledge. From controlling the movement of our eyes to determining which sources of news to consult, judging the quality of alternative sources of information is a critical part of our behavior. The goal of this symposium is to bring together researchers who are working to understand the cognitive processes underlying active information foraging and how they interact with more general aspects of cognition.",>Doug Markant>Todd Gureckis>Bjorn Meder>Jonathan Nelson>Peter Pirolli>Chen Yu,>New York University>New York University>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0038/index.html
2013,"Social Cognition, Culture and the Self. An interdisciplinary investigation","The processing of social information belongs to the most complex cognitive capacities of humans, enabling us to live together in social communities. The symposium will focus on the everyday competence to form social impressions and understand others. This capability includes 1. the understanding of oneself on the basis of an explicit selfconstrual, 2. the understanding of others by processing their mental and bodily characteristics and states 3. the understanding of social encounters by adequately interpreting actions, communicative signals and social roles. Human communication is essentially embedded in cultural contexts and is shaped by it; at the same time it constitutes the cultural background shared by the interactants. The main goal of this symposium is to investigate the role of cognitive and cultural factors influencing self-construal, person perception and understanding of others. Thus we deal with the following leading questions: How do we understand other human beings, what are the best theoretical perspectives, what can we learn from cognitive psychology and neurosciences and what is the role of culture in the process of understanding oneself and others? In the recent development of social cognition it has become clear that we not only have to account for the observational stance towards other people but that we also have to systematically consider situations of online interaction with other human beings (2nd person perspective). The main aim of the symposium is to present the state of the art of some key topics of social and cultural cognition from the perspectives of philosophy of mind, cross-cultural psychology and social-cognitive neuroscience as well as to outline some paradigmatic lines for future research.",>Albert Newen>Gary Bente>Shinobu Kitayama>Shihui Han>Kai Vogeley,">Institut für Philosophie II, Ruhr-Universität Bochum>Department of Psychology, Universitaet Koeln>Department of Psychology, University of Michigan>Department of Psychology, Peking University>Clinic of Psychiatry, Universitaet Koeln",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0039/index.html
2013,Scales of Cognition Evident in Action,"When cognitive processes occur alongside observable actions, it is possible for characteristics of these processes to influence the ongoing performance of those actions. This satisfies everyday intuitions. For example, negotiators and poker players claim to be attuned to ‘tells,’ these early behavioral indicators of eventual decisions. Going beyond intuitions, however, several researchers have exploited this fine-grained source of behavior to highlight online cognitive processing. Using even a simple measure such as computer-mouse tracking can reveal a wide range of cognitive processing. Four participants in this symposium report on applications of the analysis of the action dynamics of cognition across multiple scales: (i) basic decisions, (ii) language processing, (iii) false responding, and (iv) social processes. The similarities and differences in expression of these processes in action highlight important continuities and discontinuities across cognitive and neural processes.",>Denis O'Hora>Nicholas D.

2013,Music cognition: Bridging computation and insights from cognitive neuroscience,"In recent years, computational models have become an increasingly important part both of cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience. In tandem with these developments neuroscientific and cognitive investigations of musical experience and behaviour have been gathering pace. In this context, music cognition constitutes a rich and challenging area of cognitive science in which the processing of complex, multi-dimensional temporal sequences can be studied without interference of meaning or semantics (see Pearce & Rohrmeier, 2012, for a review). Because of its complexity and well-defined problem-space, computational modelling of music witnessed a rapid growth of successful higher-order modelling approaches.

2013,"Thinking about norms: Epistemic, rational, and moral norms in human thinking","Humans are uniquely good at inventing norms, thinking about norms, complying with norms and defeating norms. It is small wonder, then, that norms are a focus of much interest as well as debate across the cognitive sciences, encompassing such diverse issues as rationality, morality and action. The aim of the present symposium is to bring together a range of psychological and philosophical contributions to this pertinent debate. Contributors come from diverse backgrounds, including epistemology, meta-ethics, moral judgment, decision making, and reasoning. We will examine foundational issues in normative thinking, such as: What is the relation between norms and descriptions? What are the psychological mechanisms underlying normative thinking? How do epistemic and moral norms guide action? What, if any, are the appropriate norms for knowledge, rationality, and moral behaviour, and how can they be determined?",>Joëlle Proust>Emmanuel M.

2013,Implicit Learning Out of the Lab: Language and Music,"Implicit learning, essentially the ability to acquire unconscious (implicit) knowledge, is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. This symposium focuses on the acquisition of two cognitive systems that are widely regarded as prime examples of implicit learning “in the real world”, namely language and music (see e.g. Rebuschat et al., 2011; Rohrmeier & Rebuschat, 2012). This symposium brings together leading researchers from across the cognitive sciences (psychology, linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, computer science, and musicology) in order to discuss current trends in implicit learning research, to identify the progress made in recent years, and to outline future directions to take, both in terms of topics and novel methodologies.",>Patrick Rebuschat>Martin Rohrmeier>Morten Christiansen>Zoltan Dienes>Daniele Schoen>Jennifer Misyak>Clement Francois>Xiuyan Guo>Feifei Li>Richard Widdess,">Lancaster University, United Kingdom>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA>Cornell University, USA>Sussex University, United Kingdom>Aix-Marseille University, France>Warwick University, United Kingdom>Aix-Marseille University, France>East China Normal University, China>East China Normal University, China>SOAS, University of London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0043/index.html

However, a number of recent studies show that the storage of correct concepts in memory does not automatically erase related incorrect concepts from memory. As a result, naïve and scientific concepts in the same domain can coexist in a learner. The symposium aims at discussing these findings and their implications for definitions, models and empirical studies of conceptual learning and development.",>Michael Schneider>Stella Vosniadou>Andrew Shtulman>Kelsey Harrington>Ilonca Hardey>Lindsey J.

Are most of the structures already in place, with children merely working to embellish them? Do children begin with several buildings already in place (the Physics Building, the Social Building, the Number building, etc.), and only decorate a bit as they get older, perhaps building bridges between them using language? Such a view might describe a strong innate core hypothesis (Spelke et al., 1994). Or does the child begin with more of an empty plain, and an ability to construct whatever is necessary out of whatever materials are at hand at the time? Such a view might be more along the lines of classic empiricism (Quine, 1964).",>Tomer Ullman>Josh Tenenbaum>Noah Goodman>Shimon Ullman>Elizabeth Spelke,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Stanford University>Weizmann Istitute of Science , Rehovot, Israel>Harvard University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0045/index.html

2013,The empirical investigation of semantics: Between abstract-symbolic and embodied-simulative models of meaning,"Classical theories of meaning in the field of linguistics and psycholinguistics assume that meaning arises from the combination of symbols for which a substring or other part-whole relation is defined. According to this perspective, symbols are abstract, amodal (i.e., neither perceptual, nor motoric) and only contingently related to entities in the external world. For a long time, a convincing case for classical models has been the absence of alternatives. However, more recently, several theories subsumed under the notions of “embodied” or “grounded” theories have challenged the fundamental assumptions of classical models (e.g., Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg, 2010; Pecher & Zwaan, 2005). From the point of view of embodied theories, cognition is grounded in modal representations which simulate actual objects, properties and situations. Such a claim carries theoretical, empirical and methodological repercussions that also change the way linguistic processes are conceived of (Ferretti et al., 2013; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998). The goal of the symposium is to explore which repercussions these issues have on the nature of linguistic meaning and its neural and cognitive realization or representation.",>Markus Werning>Erica Cosentino,>Ruhr University Bochum>University of Calabria,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0047/index.html
2013,Online Education: A Unique Opportunity for Cognitive Scientists to Integrate Research and Practice,"That there is a rapid expansion of online education is much better understood than what its consequences will be. This symposium considers that one key feature of “real-world” education that takes place on the Internet is that it provides a high level of experimental control and automatic data collection & analysis, which can support cognitive science research that was previously only possible in laboratory settings and small-scale educational environments. The presenters discuss the unprecedented opportunities online learning provides for conducting research in ecologically valid contexts: linking existing laboratory experiments to relevant online contexts, personalizing adaptive instruction, embedding in vivo research studies of education, and using the vast amount of high quality data available. The product of such work is not only theories and empirical discoveries that better characterize learning, but also the opportunity to directly translate these into practical benefits to students through concrete improvements to educational resources.",>Joseph Jay Williams>Alexander Renkl>Ken Koedinger>John Stamper,">University of California, Berkeley>University of Fribourg>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0048/index.html
2013,Causal Reasoning with Continuous Outcomes,"We describe an attempt to understand causal reasoning in situations where a binary cause produces a change on a continuous magnitude dimension. We consider established theories of binary probabilistic causal inference – ΔP and Power PC – and adapt them to continuous non-probabilistic outcomes. While ΔP describes causal strength as the difference of effect occurrence between the presence and absence of the cause, Power PC normalizes this difference with the effect base-rate to obtain a proportional measure of causal power, relative to the maximum possible strength. Two experiments compared the applicability of each approach by creating scenarios where binary probabilistic scenarios were directly mapped onto inference problems involving continuous magnitude dimensions. Results from counterfactual judgments tentatively indicate that people reason about causal relations with continuous outcomes by adopting a proportional approach when evaluation preventive causal powers, and a difference approach in generative scenarios.",>Ahmad Azad Ab Rashid>Marc Buehner,>Cardiff University>Cardiff University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0049/index.html
2013,A Metacognitive Stopping Rule for Problem Solving,"Although people expect to improve by investing effort in solving a problem, several studies have found negative time-confidence correlations in problem-solving tasks. The present study employed the metacognitive approach to illuminate why, despite lengthy thinking, people provide solutions with low confidence. According to the proposed Diminishing Criterion Model (DCM), as people invest longer, their confidence in their solution increases in a goal-driven manner, in accordance with the common belief. Nevertheless, the process ends up with a negative time-confidence correlation, because people find lower confidence levels as satisfactory as they invest longer in a problem, reflecting a compromise in their stopping criterion. The hypotheses derived from the DCM were supported with two problem types. When a “don’t know” response was allowed, the participants still provided low confidence solutions after lengthy thinking, suggesting that they found these low confidence solutions to be satisfactory. The study offers reconciliation between beliefs and empirical findings.",>Rakefet Ackerman,">Technion--Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0050/index.html
2013,An Information-Theoretic Account of Musical Expectation and Memory,"When listening to music, we form implicit expectations about the forthcoming temporal sequence. Listeners acquire knowledge of music through processes such as statistical learning, but how do different types of statistical information affect listeners’ learning and memory? To investigate this, we conducted a behavioral study in which participants repeatedly heard tone sequences varying within a range of information-theoretic measures. Expectedness ratings of tones were collected during three listening sessions, and a recognition memory test was given after each session. This enabled us to examine how statistical information affects expectation and memory for tone sequences over a period of increasing exposure. We found significant correlations between listeners’ expectedness ratings and measures of information theory (IT), and although listeners demonstrated poor overall memory performance, the IT properties significantly impacted on musical memory. Generally, simple sequences yielded increasingly better memory performance. High-information sequences, for which making accurate predictions is difficult, resulted in consistently poor recognition memory.",>Kat Agres>Samer Abdallah>Marcus Pearce,">Queen Mary, University of London>Queen Mary, University of London>Queen Mary, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0051/index.html
2013,Effector specific response activation during word processing,"Theories of embodied cognition suggest that sensorimotor processes are involved in language comprehension processes. Recent studies suggested that sentences referring to actions that involve a typical effector (e.g. “He kicks the ball”) can systematically activate motor cortex areas that are involved in performing such actions (Hauk, Johnsrude & Pulvermüller, 2004). In behavioral studies, there is mixed evidence regarding the effects of effector-specific words on corresponding actions. In the current study, we investigated the effect of four word groups on subsequent motor responses involving the hand or the foot. The four word groups were (a) action verbs (e.g., kick, grasp) (b) nouns containing the lexeme ‘hand’ or ‘foot’ (e.g., handball, football) (c) nouns referring to objects that are typically manipulated by hand or foot (e.g., cup, shoe), and (d) as control items, nouns that have a spatial association with the upper or lower space (e.g., eagle, root) and which are known to activate locational information in paradigms where no reading is required. We found strong effector-specific compatibility effects revealing a facilitation effect in all noun-groups. Surprisingly, this effect was not present for the action-verbs. Implications of these findings will be discussed.",>Daniela Ahlberg>Carolin Dudschig>Barbara Kaup,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0052/index.html
2013,Simulating Overall and Trial-by-Trial Effects in Response Selection with a Biologically-plausible Connectionist Network,"Ratcliff, Van Zandt, and McKoon (1999, Psych. Rev.) claim that connectionist models fail to simulate many aspects of how individuals select one of two possible responses. Here, these claims are re-evaluated via computational and behavioral investigations of an extended version of the original numerosity judgment task. The results of the experiment indicate that some of the empirical effects that the models failed to capture do not generalize and were likely due to idiosyncratic aspects of the original methodology. The simulations show that a more biologically-plausible model captures the bulk of the new effects, including some trial-by-trial adaptive effects that are outside the scope of models tested against aggregate data, and emergent asymptotic stability that has previously required an explicit leak parameter.",>Blair Armstrong>David Plaut,">Basque Center for Cognition, Brain, and Language, San Sebastian, Gipuzkoa, Spain>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0053/index.html

The goal is to understand how context influences the activation of salient and non-salient features of a concept during the on-line processing of a metaphor. In two mouse-tracking experiments, we examine the activation and availability of conceptual features that were either irrelevant or relevant for understanding a metaphor across various contexts. Our findings support the conclusion that context works primarily by rapidly suppressing salient features of a concept that are not relevant for the particular metaphorical interpretation. What is more, it seems that even further contextual manipulation does not facilitate the activation of non-salient metaphor relevant features.",>John M.

2013,Object motion continuity and the flash-lag effect,"When a visual object is briefly flashed, it appears to lag behind another moving object (flash-lag effect; FLE). Previous studies show that a sudden change to the moving object at the time of the flash presentation can eliminate the FLE. We examined whether the FLE is eliminated when a moving object alternates in color as it moves. Observers viewed a moving disc, the color of which did not change at all, changed only once when another object flashed, or alternated between two colors as it moved before the flash presentation. The results showed that although the magnitude of the FLE was reduced compared with the no-change condition, the FLE observed with the moving object that changed color during motion was significantly stronger than the FLE in the one-change condition. The results are discussed in relation to the object updating account of the FLE.",>Ricky K. C.

The present study examined effects of two interface design features on participant performance during a molecule orientation task. The features examined were 1) colocation of the visual and haptic workspace and 2) stereoscopic viewing. The results indicate that colocating the interface increased participant accuracy, while providing stereo did not. Neither factor affected response time. The effects of colocation were also reflected in subjective ratings of task demand measured by the NASA-TLX. Spatial ability was predictive of task performance but did not interact with interface effects.

2013,Using the words toddlers know now to predict the words they will learn next,"We set forth to show that lexical connectivity plays a role in understanding early word learning. By considering words that are learned in temporal proximity to one another to be related, we are able to better predict the words next learned by toddlers. We build conditional probability models based on data from the growing vocabularies of 77 toddlers, followed longitudinally for a year. This type of conditional probability model outperforms the current norms based on baseline probabilities of learning given age alone. This is a first step to capturing the interaction between a child’s productive vocabulary and their learning environment in order to understand what words a child might learn next. We also test different types of variants of this conditional probability and find that not only is there information in words that are learned in proximity to one another but that it matters how models integrate this information. The application of this work may provide better cognitive models of acquisition and perhaps allow us to detect children at risk for enduring language difficulties earlier and more accurately.",>Nicole Beckage>Eliana Colunga,>University of Colorado Boulder>University of Colorado Boulder,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0057/index.html
2013,Simultaneous unsupervised and supervised learning of cognitive functions in biologically plausible spiking neural networks,"We present a novel learning rule for learning transformations of sophisticated neural representations in a biologically plausible manner. We show that the rule can learn to transmit and bind semantic pointers. Semantic pointers have previously been used to build Spaun, which is currently the world’s largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012) and can perform several complex cognitive tasks. The learning rule combines a previously proposed supervised learning rule and a novel spiking form of the BCM unsupervised learning rule. We show that spiking BCM increases sparsity of connection weights at the cost of increased signal transmission error. We demonstrate that the combined learning rule can learn transformations as well as the supervised rule alone, and as well as the offline optimization used previously. We also demonstrate that the combined learning rule is more robust to changes in parameters and leads to better outcomes in higher dimensional spaces.",>Trevor Bekolay>Carter Kolbeck>Chris Eliasmith,">University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0058/index.html
2013,Balancing Fairness and Efficiency in Repeated Societal Interaction,"Fairness and efficiency are important aspects that influence cooperation in social dilemmas. During a repeated interaction, they have the potential to serve as competing goals for the decision maker. The ability to balance between fairness and efficiency depends, among other things, on available information regarding mutual accountability for the outcomes in an interaction. In this paper, we examine how information regarding mutual interdependencies influences the interplay between fairness and efficiency in repeated Chicken Game. We distinguish between three possible types of fair behavior: mutual cooperation, alternating cooperation, and mutual destruction. Our results show that the first two types of fairness are positively correlated with the availability of social information. In contrast, mutual destructive fairness is not sensitive to the availability of information and is generally avoided. We also find that without information regarding mutual interdependencies, unfairness increases in parallel with efficiency. When social information is available, however, increases in fairness is coupled with a decrease in efficiency, and the best compromise between fairness and efficiency is reached when mutual interdependencies are learned through repeated experiences. We highlight the significance of our results for fair and efficient interaction in repeated social interactions.",>Noam Ben-Asher>Christian Lebiere>Alessandro Oltramari>Cleotilde Gonzalez,">Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory, Department of Social and Decision Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University>Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University>Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University>Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory, Department of Social and Decision Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0059/index.html
2013,Beyond Rule versus Rote? Processing of Distinctive Dative and Genitive Case Markers in German,"The rule versus rote distinction is one of the most debated issues in recent psycholinguistics. Dual route accounts hold that words can either be stored whole in the mental lexicon or computationally derived by simple combinatorial rules such as stem+affix. Within this framework, response latencies in lexical decision tasks have been applied to point out the difference between rote memorization, on the one hand, and combinatorial rule manipulation, on the other. However, this paper argues that there may be alternatives to this distinction. It will be shown that German nouns, which can be distinctively marked for number, case or both number and case, do elicit differing reaction times. Crucially, this effect can neither be explained by surface frequency effects nor by internal morphological structure.

2013,Social and Environmental Contributors to Infant Word Learning,"Infants demonstrate comprehension of early nouns (e.g. “hand”) around six months, and comprehension of early non-nouns (e.g. “eat”) around 10 months. In two experiments, we explore the reasons for this lag. Expt. 1 is a gaze-following study, the results of which suggest an improvement in point-following around ten months, and reveal correlations between pointing and both overall and non-noun vocabulary. Expt. 2 is a set of corpus analyses, the results of which suggest that word frequency does not explain the difference between noun and non-noun age of acquisition, while suggesting that the co-presence of words and their referents may play an important role. The results of these experiments contribute to our understanding of word-learning across word classes, and lend support to environmental and social factors as having an impact on the trajectory of word learning in the first year of life.",>Elika Bergelson>Daniel Swingley,">University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA>University of Pennsylvania",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0061/index.html
2013,Grid or no grid: Distance distortion in recognizing spatial information from complex cartographic maps,"Mental representations of environments are embodied in cognitive maps. Cognitive maps enclose spatial and distance distortions, which appear due to transcription errors based on processing of map information. Participants processed complex cartographical maps of varying amounts of visual details like topography, boundaries and grid to examine their effects on recall and orientation performance. The results indicate that the presentation of boundaries, topographies and a square grid significantly reduced distortion errors compared to a blank map, whereas a presentation of more than one visual element did not further reduce the distortions.",>Anne-Kathrin Bestgen>Dennis Edler>Frank Dickmann>Lars Kuchinke,>Ruhr-Univsersität Bochum>Ruhr-Univsersität Bochum>Ruhr-Univsersität Bochum>Ruhr-Univsersität Bochum,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0062/index.html
2013,Evidence for cognitively controlled saccade targeting in reading,"It is generally assumed that the character position targeted within a particular word is not under direct cognitive control, but is rather determined by oculomotor processes sensitive only to word length and distance. An alternative view is that readers target more distant characters in words when they have parafoveally processed these words more. These possibilities are difficult to distinguish because the actual landing site within a word has large effects on subsequent word processing measures. In two experiments, we decoupled the targeted location from the actual landing site by shifting the text 3 characters during the saccade into a target word. Results show that subsequent word processing time given a particular landing site was lower/higher when the eyes would have landed further forward/backward in the word. This effect remains significant in some cases when controlling for saccade launch site. These data provide evidence against the oculomotor theory and support a cognitive account of saccade targeting.",>Klinton Bicknell>Emily Higgins>Roger Levy>Keith Rayner,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0063/index.html
2013,Fusiform Face Area in Chess Expertise,"The ability to recognize faces is arguably one of the most important and most practiced skills. The possible functions of the fusiform face area (FFA), generally believed to be responsible for face recognition, also feature these two characteristics. On the one hand, there are claims that the FFA has evolved into a face specific module due to great importance of face processing. On the other, the FFA is seen as a general visual expertise module that distinguishes between individual examples within a single category. The previous studies used experts and novices on stimuli such as cars, birds or butterflies with ambiguous results. Here this research stream is extended to the game of chess, which does not share visible features with faces. The first study shows that chess expertise modulates the FFA activation when complex multi-object chess positions were presented. In contrast, isolated single chess objects did not produce different activation patterns among experts and novices. The second study confirmed that even a couple of isolated objects do not differently engage the FFA among experts and novices. The two studies provide support for the general expertise view of the FFA function, but also extend the scope of our understanding about the function of the FFA. The FFA does not merely distinguish between different exemplars. It also seems to engage into parsing complex multi-object stimuli that contain numerous functional and spatial relations.",>Merim Bilalic,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0064/index.html

MEG reveals perspective-taking in response to pragmatic violations, but not in anticipation","The current study investigates whether mentalizing, or taking the perspective of your interlocutor, plays an essential role throughout a conversation or whether it is mostly used in reaction to misunderstandings. This study is the first to use a brain-imaging method, MEG, to answer this question. In a first phase of the experiment, MEG participants interacted ""live"" with a confederate who set naming precedents for certain pictures. In a later phase, these precedents were sometimes broken by a speaker who named the same picture in a different way. This could be done by the same speaker, who set the precedent, or by a different speaker. Source analysis of MEG data showed that in the 800 ms before the naming, when the picture was already on the screen, episodic memory and language areas were activated, but no mentalizing areas, suggesting that the speaker's naming intentions were not anticipated by the listener on the basis of shared experiences. Mentalizing areas only became activated after the same speaker had broken a precedent, which we interpret as a reaction to the violation of conversational pragmatics.",>Sara Bögels>Dale Barr>Simon Garrod>Klaus Kessler,">MPI for psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>University of Glasgow>University of Glasgow>University of Glasgow",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0066/index.html
2013,Discovering Processing Stages by combining EEG with Hidden Markov Models,"A new method is demonstrated for identifying processing stages in a task. Since the 1860s cognitive scientists have used different methods to identify processing stages, usually based on reaction time (RT) differences between conditions. To overcome the limitations of RT-based methods we used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to analyze EEG data. The HMMs indicate for how many stages there is evidence in the data, and how the durations of these stages vary with experimental condition. This method was applied to an associative recognition task in which associative strength and target/foil type were manipulated. The HMM-EEG method identified six different processing stages for targets and re-paired foils, whereas four similar stages were identified for new foils. The duration of the third, fifth and sixth stage varied with associative strength for targets and re-paired foils. We present an interpretation of the identified stages, and conclude that the method can provide valuable insight in human information processing.",>Jelmer Borst>John Anderson,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0067/index.html

Participants were primed to understand either the basic meaning or the enriched meaning of a sentence. We found that the enrichment mechanism could be primed across some expressions but not others, arguing against a universal enrichment mechanism.

2013,Space is Special: A domain-specific mapping between time and nontemporal magnitude,"Across different domains the magnitude of a stimulus is positively correlated with its perceived duration: bigger, brighter or louder stimuli are usually perceived to last longer than smaller, dimmer or softer ones. According to A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM), temporal and nontemporal magnitudes are linked in the human mind by virtue of sharing a common metric. This claim has been challenged by studies in the domains of brightness and loudness suggesting that it is not the difference in magnitude between stimuli, but rather their degree of change from background that modulates duration judgments. But do the same relationships hold between perceived duration and all prothetic dimensions? We tested the influence of stimulus magnitude and relative change on temporal judgment in the domain of space. We found that, unlike brightness and loudness, spatial length can influence duration judgments independently of the degree of change from a common background, and that this effect is context dependent. Thus, an approach based exclusively on the degree of change between stimulus and background is not sufficient to account for the effect of magnitude on temporal judgments. Our results suggest that space has a privileged link with temporal representations compared to other prothetic domains, challenging the hypothesis that space-time relationships are the product of a domain-general magnitude system.",>Roberto Bottini>Daniel Casasanto,">Department of Psychology, New School for Social Research>Department of Psychology, New School for Social Research",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0069/index.html
2013,Open-Ended Category-Based Induction: The Influence of Associative Strength and Structured Knowledge Representations,"Accounts of category-based inductive reasoning can be distinguished by the emphasis they place on associative retrieval processes versus structural knowledge representation. Using an open-ended category-based induction task with a secondary task manipulation, we explored whether the relative importance of these two processes in determining the reasoning output depends upon the availability of mental resources. Regressing indices of strength of association and measures of structured relation against reasoners’ inferences showed that people’s inductions generated under cognitive load were more strongly predicted by associative strength between base and conclusion category. In contrast, inferences made under no load were best predicted by the measure of the existence of structural relations between base and conclusion category. This suggests that people make use of associative processes and recruit structured knowledge to make inductive inferences, and that the relative importance of these two forms of reasoning is determined by the availability of mental resources",>Aimee Kay Bright>Aidan Feeney,">Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom>Queen's University Belfast",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0070/index.html
2013,Motor Asymmetries Predict Neural Organization of Emotion,"According to decades of research in affective neuroscience, the left and right hemispheres are specialized for approach and avoidance motivation, respectively. With the Sword and Shield Hypothesis (SSH) we challenge this conclusion; we propose that the lateralization of motivation depends on the lateralization of motor control for the dominant and non-dominant hands (used preferentially for approach and avoidance actions, respectively). The SSH predicts that the laterality of approach motivation should vary continuously with the laterality of circuits supporting approach-related actions. We measured mood before and after 5 sessions of tDCS applied bilaterally to DLPFC in right- and left-handers. Results in right-handers show that positive emotions increased after left-excitatory stimulation, but decreased after right-excitatory stimulation. In non-right-handers, however, the opposite pattern was found: Positive emotions decreased after left-excitatory stimulation, but increased after right-excitatory stimulation. These results reveal continuous covariation between the neural systems for action and emotion, supporting the SSH.",>Geoffrey Brookshire>Cleve Graver>Daniel Casasanto,">New School for Social Research>New School for Social Research>New School for Social Research; Donders Center for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0071/index.html
2013,The Effect of Discourse Context on Online Sentence Processing,Information structure describes how the information is packaged within a discourse to optimize information transfer. We addressed the question if and how a discourse context modulates the online processing of German declaratives. Native speakers of German read fictitious stories that depicted a simple action scene of two characters while we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Two types of discourse contexts (topic vs. neutral) were compared with regard to the processing of declarative canonical subject-before-object (SO) and non-canonical object-before-subject (OS) sentences. The preceding topic context only modulated the processing of OS sentences. This was indicated by a less pronounced positivity around 500 to 900 ms for the topic compared to the neutral context. As supported by previous research we argue that this context-induced effect in the processing of non-canonical sentences reflects reduced processing costs for the integration of the discourse relevant topic information into the current discourse model.,>Juliane Burmester>Isabell Wartenburger>Katharina Spalek,>University of Potsdam>University of Potsdam>Humboldt-Universität Berlin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0072/index.html
2013,Probabilistic reasoning in the two-envelope problem,"In the two-envelope problem a reasoner is offered two envelopes, one containing exactly twice the money in the other. After observing the amount in one envelope it can be traded for the unseen contents of the other. Until recently it was argued that it did not matter whether the envelope was traded or not, but Abbott, Davis & Parrondo (2010) showed that gains could be made if trading was a probabilistic function of amount observed. Three experiments varied where the observed and maximum amounts fell in a possible distribution and tested whether this affected choices. Trading was less likely for lower observed amount than higher, but this effect differed depending on the stated distribution. This suggests that participants’ trade decisions were affected by where observations fit in the distribution, and thus their probabilities. The modeling tools used here may be applicable to other reasoning phenomena.",>Bruce Burns,>University of Sydney,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0073/index.html

In two experiments, we further investigate this finding. Four-year-olds were adept at navigating pedagogical interactions, judiciously identifying which specific actions in an ongoing interaction were meant as communicative demonstrations for their benefit, while 3-year-olds did not distinguish between the manners of demonstration even in a simpler context.

I focus on two papers with conflicting results on the learnability of natural and unnatural rules. Saffran and Thiessen (2003) find that a phonotactic pattern of positional voicing restrictions governed by a natural class of segments is learned by infants, but a similar pattern governed by an unnatural class is not learned. In contrast, Chambers, Onishi, and Fisher (2003) find that infants can learn a phonotactic pattern governed by an unnatural class of segments. The computational model presented in this paper is able to account for these seemingly conflicting results, explaining both the learnability and unlearnability of rules governed by unnatural classes.",>Shira Calamaro,">Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0075/index.html

To do this, we’ll start analyzing an example of highly complex society, like that of the baboons, in order to show that the building-up of a society depends on extremely flexible and continually negotiated social relationships, rather than on features that are genetically determined. However, in our view, when we shift from animal societies to the human ones, we have to recognize the central role of language. In fact, even if the role of social influence appears to be relevant in other animal species, in humans it was language that provided the way to make this social influence much more important, to redefine the roles, to reverse the genetic dominances even more, and to make human cooperation something unique.",>Valentina Cardella>Alessandra Falzone>Antonino Pennisi,">university of messina, messina, italy, Italy>university of messina, messina>university of messina, messina",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0076/index.html

Sixty-four older adults provided directions for how to find a target or where to find a target to a robot or human (named Brian) avatar. There were systematic differences in the form and structure of the descriptions based on the communicative task. Specifically, how descriptions were longer, contained more detail, and were dynamically structured as compared to where descriptions. However, where descriptions were found to be more effective in conveying the target location, as assessed with a subsequent target selection task.

While this sort of falsification is straightforward when the observations are incompatible with each of the hypotheses, an interesting situation arises when the observations are implausible under the hypotheses but not incompatible with them. We propose a formal account, inspired by statistical model checking, as an explanation for how people reason about these probabilistic falsifications.

Here we extend that finding to the semantic domain of spatial relations. Levinson et al. (2003) have proposed a hierarchy of spatial category evolution, and we show that English speakers successively pile-sort spatial scenes in a manner that recapitulates that proposed evolutionary hierarchy. Thus, in the spatial domain, as in color, proposed universal patterns of language change based on cross-language observations appear to reflect general cognitive forces that are available in the minds of speakers of a single language.",>Alexandra Carstensen>Terry Regier,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0079/index.html

Even one- and two-year-old children made accurate and spontaneous predictions about when a turn-switch would occur: they gazed at the upcoming speaker before they heard a response begin. This predictive skill relies on both lexical and prosodic information together, and is not tied to either type of information alone.

In particular, we tested which aspects of gestures were “transferred” from a language to another. Though transfer in spoken languages has been studied extensively, transfer in gesture is understudied. Gesture transfer can provide useful information on the cognitive architecture in bilingualism. In this study our focus is on gesture rate and gesture space in Italian/English bilinguals. Contrary to previous findings, we have no evidence of transfer. When bilinguals switch language, their gesture parameters switch accordingly. The switch of gesture (cultural) parameters such as rate and salience show that language and gesture are tightly linked. This suggests that a language and the corresponding gesture parameters might be selected in a high level processing stage at which verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication are planned together.",>Federica Cavicchio>Sotaro Kita,">University of Trento, Rovereto, Trento, Italy>University of Birmingham",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0081/index.html
2013,Modelling Graded Semantic Effects in Lexical Decision,"Recent studies have shown that the involvement of semantic information in visual lexical decision depends on the nature of nonword foils with semantic effects increased as nonwords become more word-like (Evans, Lambon Ralph &Woollams;, 2012). Given that most models of lexical decision focus on orthographic information (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon & Ziegler, 2001; Grainger & Jacobs, 1996; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989), the role of semantics and its interactions with vision, orthography, and phonology has been overlooked. We developed a recurrent connectionist model of single word reading including visual, orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing. The model differentiated words from nonwords by integrating measures of polarity across four key processing layers. The contribution of semantics depended on the type of nonword foils. The model was more reliant on semantic information when the nonword foils were pseudowords and pseudohomophones rather than consonant strings. The results support the view that semantic involvement in lexical decision is graded by the difficulty of the decision task.",>Ya-Ning Chang>Matthew Lambon Ralph>Steve Furber>Stephen Welbourne,">Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit, University of Manchester>Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit, University of Manchester>Advanced Processor Technologies Group, University of Manchester>Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit, University of Manchester",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0082/index.html
2013,Eyetracking as an Implicit Measure of Category-Based Induction,"Category information is used to predict unknown properties of category members. Previous research has found that when categorization is uncertain, property predictions do not reflect integration of information across categories as normative principles and Bayesian models would suggest. Rather, people often base their predictions on only the most likely category and disregard information from less likely ones. Research in category-based induction tends to elicit explicit, verbal responses which may not readily allow for integration of information across categories. This paper explores whether changing response mode can promote more normative use of category information in induction. Experiment 1 used an implicit measure of prediction: eye movements. The results suggest that when making predictions implicitly people integrate information across categories. The results of Experiment 2 suggest that the integration of information found in Experiment 1 were not a result of explicit strategies.",>Stephanie Chen>Brian Ross>Gregory Murphy,>New York University>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0083/index.html

Neural activity represents a structured set of rules, such as “If you see a 1, then push button A, and if you see a 2, then push button B”. Synaptic connections between these neurons and the basal ganglia, thalamus, and other areas cause the system to detect when rules should be applied and to then do so. The model gives a reaction time difference of 77 ms between the simple and two-choice reaction time tasks, and requires 384 ms per item for sub-vocal counting, consistent with human experimental results.

We conducted a simple face recognition task and recorded eye movements and performance of the participants. We used a variational Bayesian framework for Gaussian mixture models to estimate the distribution of fixation locations and modelled the fixation and transition data using HMMs. We showed that using HMMs, we can describe individuals’ eye movement strategies with both fixation locations and transition probabilities. By clustering these HMMs, we found that the strategies can be categorized into two subgroups; one was more holistic and the other was more analytical. Furthermore, we found that correct and wrong recognitions were associated with distinctive eye movement strategies. The difference between these strategies lied in their transition probabilities.",>Tim Chuk>Alvin C. W. Ng>Emanuele Coviello>Antoni B. Chan>Janet H.

2013,Uniquely human developmental timing may drive cerebral lateralization and interhemispheric coupling,"Cerebral lateralization is intertwined with virtually every cognitive function that we think makes us human. Yet a clear dichotomy has never been explained: lateralized processing suggests independent, local development of neural circuits, but the complementary nature of lateralized functions and extremely strong functional coupling between homologous areas suggest robust interhemispheric interactions. Here, we review literature and present modeling evidence that this dichotomy can be explained by the uniquely steep trajectory of human post-natal brain growth. This drastic volumetric change cause most long distance, interhemispheric connections to be more unreliable than shorter, intrahemispheric connections, leading to lateralization. Strong interhemispheric collaboration is enabled by the later maturation and myelination of long-distance callosal connections. We also review and reanalyze a well-cited modeling paper (Ringo, Doty, Demeter, & Simard, 1994) thought to show a relationship between the degree of hemispheric coordination and length of conduction delays, showing that previous claims have a clear alternative explanation.",>Benjamin Cipollini>Garrison Cottrell,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0086/index.html

Contrary to the predictions of most models, performance improves when diagnostic information is available later, rather than earlier. These results are accounted for by a dynamic model of recognition, where the time at which information starts to be accumulated for a recognition decision can vary independently of when features are available to be sampled from the test display. The same model is shown to be able to reproduce the priming results of Jacoby & Whitehouse (1989), originally attributed to a fluency heuristic.

2013,Representing Number Sets: Encoding Statistical Properties,"Previous research suggests that people often recall individual items when sets are smaller than four and aggregate set features for sets larger than four. One intriguing possibility is that the process of aggregating sets creates summary representations that maintain the statistical properties of the set itself. For sets of numbers, this process might implicitly create approximate means. We report the results of two experiments investigating memory for number sets and its relation to working memory and metacognitive monitoring. In both experiments, participants were shown a series of data sets that varied in size (4, 6, or 8 numbers) and variance (10% or 20% of the mean) and were then presented with an actual value from the set and the set mean. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to select the actual value, and in Experiment 2, participants were asked to select the set mean. Results indicated that the proportion of correct selections and metacognitive confidence decreased with set size. Working memory was related to performance only when the set size was 6. The findings suggest that participants often erroneously reported the set mean as being a member of the set and that this effect increased for sets larger than four.

2013,Achievement Motivation and Strategy Selection during Exploratory Learning,"Exploratory learning before instruction can benefit understanding, but can also be challenging. Individual differences in response to challenge, such as achievement motivation, may therefore moderate the benefits of exploratory learning. Higher mastery orientation generally leads to increased effort in response to challenge, whereas higher performance orientation leads to withdrawal. Children (2nd-4th grade; N=159) were given mathematical equivalence problems to solve as either an exploratory learning activity (before instruction) or as practice (after instruction). Higher mastery orientation was associated with improved learning from exploration. In contrast, performance orientation did not lead to learning improvements—and sometimes even hurt learning. Higher mastery orientation was also associated with more sophisticated problem-solving strategies during exploration. Although exploratory activities have the potential to advance strategy selection and subsequent learning, achievement motivation may boost or hinder these benefits.",>Daniel DeCaro>Marci DeCaro>Bethany Rittle-Johnson,>Indiana University>University of Louisville>Vanderbilt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0092/index.html
2013,Cost-Based Pragmatic Inference about Referential Expressions,"We present data from three experiments addressing how much theory of mind reasoning is involved in production and interpretation of ambiguous referential expressions in an artificial language task, and how this interacts with the cost and availability of alternative utterances. When an unambiguous alternative is not available, listeners tend to draw simple Quantity inferences reminiscent of scalar implicatures (Grice, 1975). When an unambiguous alternative is available, fewer inferences are observed, but gradiently more as the cost of unambiguous alternatives increase. We outline a novel game theoretic model of pragmatic reasoning based on probabilistic back-and-forth reasoning about interlocutors’ rational choices and beliefs. The model provides a good fit to the data and raises interesting issues for future research.",>Judith Degen>Michael Franke>Gerhard Jäger,>University of Rochester>Universiteit van Amsterdam>Universität Tübingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0093/index.html
2013,"Superficial, rather than true, knowledge interdependence in collaborative learning fosters individual knowledge transfer","We test the hypothesis that superficial knowledge interdependence is more effective in fostering individual learning from collaboration than the true knowledge interdependence often realized by jigsaw-type collaboration arrangements. Based on research on group information-processing, we argue for the benefits of distributing only contextual information, but not core principles between learners, establishing superficial knowledge interdependence. In a computer-supported collaborative learning environment, 78 university students learned about stochastic urn models. Knowledge interdependence was established by systematically distributing learning materials within student triads, so that students either became experts for an urn model, establishing true knowledge interdependence, or for one of the embedding cover stories, establishing superficial knowledge interdependence. Afterwards, all triads worked on the same collaborative tasks, and were exposed to all models. Results show successful learning across conditions, but superior knowledge transfer in triads collaborating under superficial knowledge interdependence. Benefits were highest for low prior knowledge learners.",>Anne Deiglmayr>Lennart Schalk,>ETH Zurich>ETH Zurich,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0094/index.html
2013,Analogical Reasoning with Rational Numbers: Semantic Alignment Based on Discrete Versus Continuous Quantities,"Non-integer rational numbers, such as fractions and decimals, pose challenges for learners, both in conceptual understanding and in performing mathematical operations. Previous studies have focused on tasks involving access and comparison of integrated magnitude representations, showing that adults have less precise magnitude representations for fractions than decimals. Here we show the relative effectiveness of fractions over decimals in reasoning about relations between quantities. We constructed analogical reasoning problems that required mapping rational numbers (fractions or decimals) onto pictures depicting either part-whole or ratio relations between two quantities. We also varied the ontological nature of the depicted quantities, which could be discrete, continuous, or continuous but parsed into discrete components. Fractions were more effective than decimals for reasoning about discrete and continuous-parsed (i.e., discretized) quantities, whereas neither number type was particularly effective in reasoning about continuous quantities. Our findings show that, when numbers serve as models of quantitative relations, the ease of relational mapping depends on the analogical correspondence between the format of rational numbers and the quantity it models.",>Melissa DeWolf>Miriam Bassok>Keith Holyoak,">University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States>University of Washington>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0095/index.html
2013,Learning to perceive coherent objects,"Object segregation in a visual scene is a complex perceptual process that relies on the integration of multiple cues. The task is computationally challenging, and even the best performing models fall significantly short of human performance. Infants initially have a surprisingly impoverished set of segregation cues and their ability to perform object segregation in static images is severely limited. Major questions that arise are therefore how the rich set of useful cues is learned, and what initial capacities make this learning possible. Here we present a computational model that initially incorporates only two basic capacities known to exist at an early age: the grouping of image regions by common motion and the detection of motion discontinuities. The model then learns significant aspects of object segregation in static images in an entirely unsupervised manner by observing videos of objects in motion. Implications of the model to infant learning and to the future development of object segregation models are discussed.",>Nimrod Dorfman>Daniel Harari>Shimon Ullman,>Weizmann Institute>Weizmann Institute>Weizmann Institute,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0096/index.html
2013,Removal of Information from Working Memory,"Standard working memory (WM) updating tasks confound updating requirements with generic WM functions. We introduce a method for isolating a process unique to WM updating, namely the removal of no-longer relevant information. In a modified version of an established updating paradigm, to-be-updated items were cued before the new memoranda were presented. Longer cue-stimulus intervals—that is, longer removal time—led to faster updating, showing that people can actively remove information from WM. Well-established effects of item repetition and similarity on updating RTs were diminished with longer removal time, arguably because representational overlap between out-dated and new information becomes less influential when out-dated information can be removed prior to new encoding. The benefit of removal time was found only for partial updating, not for complete updating of entire memory sets. We conclude that removal of out-dated information can be experimentally isolated, and that removal is a unique, active WM updating process.",>Ullrich Ecker>Stephan Lewandowsky>Klaus Oberauer,">University of Western Australia>University of Bristol, University of Western Australia>University of Zurich",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0097/index.html
2013,Effects of Explanation and Comparison on Category Learning,"Generating explanations and making comparisons have both been shown to improve learning. While each process has been studied individually, the relationship between explanation and comparison is not well understood. Three experiments evaluated the effectiveness of explanation and comparison prompts in learning novel categories. In Experiment 1, participants explained items’ category membership, performed pairwise comparisons between items (listed similarities and differences), did both, or did a control task. The explanation task increased the discovery of rules underlying category membership; however, the comparison task decreased rule discovery. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that (1) comparing all four category exemplars was more effective than either within-category or between-category pairwise comparisons, and that (2) “explain” participants reported higher levels of both spontaneous explanation and comparison than “compare” participants. This work provides insights into when explanation and comparison are most effective, and how these processes can work together to maximize learning.",>Brian Edwards>Joseph Jay Williams>Tania Lombrozo,">Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0098/index.html
2013,"Biologically Plausible, Human-scale Knowledge Representation","Several approaches to implementing symbol-like represen- tations in neurally plausible models have been proposed. These approaches include binding through synchrony (Shas- tri & Ajjanagadde, 1993), mesh binding (van Der Velde & de Kamps, 2006), and conjunctive binding (Smolensky, 1990; Plate, 2003). Recent theoretical work has suggested that most of these methods will not scale well – that is, they cannot en- code structured representations that use any of the tens of thou- sands of terms in the adult lexicon without making implausible resource assumptions (Stewart & Eliasmith, 2011; Eliasmith, in press). Here we present an approach that will scale appro- priately, and which is based on neurally implementing a type of Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). Specifically, we con- struct a spiking neural network composed of about 2.5 million neurons that employs a VSA to encode and decode the main lexical relations in WordNet, a semantic network containing over 100,000 concepts (Fellbaum, 1998). We experimentally demonstrate the capabilities of our model by measuring its per- formance on three tasks which test its ability to accurately tra- verse the WordNet hierarchy, as well as to decode sentences employing any WordNet term while preserving the original lexical structure. We argue that these results show that our approach is uniquely well-suited to providing a biologically plausible, human-scale account of the structured representa- tions that underwrite cognition.",>Crawford Eric>Gingerich Matthew>Eliasmith Chris,>University of Waterloo>University of British Columbia>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0099/index.html
2013,Cross-Situational Statistical Learning of Phonologically Overlapping Words,"Recent research has sought to examine how learners are able to track the co-occurrence of words and objects across moments in time, a behavior commonly termed cross-situational statistical learning. The current experiment was designed to examine if learners can simultaneously determine word-referent pairings while engaging in other cognitive processes that support language learning, such as distinguishing phonologically overlapping words. Participants were presented with a cross-situational statistical learning task with pairs of words in four categories: non-minimal pairs, near minimal pairs, vowel minimal pairs, and consonant minimal pairs. The results revealed that participants were able to simultaneously learn word-referent pairings while distinguishing all four categories of word pairings. However, learners experienced the most difficulty learning vowel minimal pairs.

2013,Intuition versus Reason: Strategies that People Use to Think about Moral Problems,"We asked college students to make judgments about realistic moral situations presented as dilemmas (which asked for an either/or decision) vs. problems (which did not ask for such a decision) as well as when the situation explicitly included affectively salient language vs. non-affectively salient language. We report two main findings. The first is that there are four different types of cognitive strategy that subjects use in their responses: simple reasoning, intuitive judging, cautious reasoning, and empathic reasoning. We give operational definitions of these types in terms of our observed data. In addition, the four types characterized strategies not only in the whole sample, but also in all of the subsamples in our study. The second finding is that the intuitive judging type comprised approximately 26% of our respondents, while about 74% of our respondents employed one of the three styles of reasoning named above. We think that these findings present an interesting challenge to models of moral cognition which predict that there is either a single, or a single most common, strategy – especially a strategy of relying upon one’s intuitions – that people use to think about moral situations.",>Mark Fedyk>Barbara Koslowski,>Mount Allison University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0101/index.html
2013,Communicative biases shape structures of newly acquired languages,"Languages around the world share a number of commonalities known as language universals. We investigate whether the existence of some recurrent patterns can be explained by the learner’s preference to balance the amount of information provided by the cues to sentence meaning. In an artificial language learning paradigm, we expose learners to two languages with optional case-marking – one with fixed and one with flexible word order. We find that learners of the flexible word order language, where word order is uninformative of sentence meaning, use significantly more case-marking than the learners of the fixed word order language, where case is a redundant cue. The learning outcomes in our experiment parallel a variety of typological phenomena, providing support for the hypothesis that communicative biases can shape language structures.",>Maryia Fedzechkina>T.

We investigate the role of task difficulty on regularization behavior in a non-linguistic frequency learning task and show that adults regularize variable input when tracking multiple frequencies concurrently, but reliably reproduce the variation they have observed when tracking one frequency.

Using an artificial language learning paradigm, participants were exposed to picture-sound pairs in which pictures of animals varied by number (singular, dual and plural), but with irrelevant gender information intermixed with the exposure items (masculine, feminine and neuter). Auditory stimuli were presented in CVCVCV forms (e.g., [zovabu]) in which the first two syllables denoted the animal (e.g., [zova] for snail) and the final syllable denoted number.

Even though this interaction is easily recognizable, it is not clear how contextual information is processed and included into concept representations. The aim of this paper is to shed light on this question by analyzing the effect that an increasing amount of context exerts on conceptual processing. We report a self-paced reading experiment and a visual world experiment to test two hypotheses about the integration of context information: the incremental activation hypothesis suggests that the degree of facilitation in concept processing increases with the amount of context available; and the immediate activation hypothesis states that once a sufficient amount of contextual support is reached, no more facilitation occurs.

In 24 pairs, Directors first studied an array with a symmetrical structure while either knowing their Matcher’s subsequent viewpoint or not. When describing the array to the Matcher, the array’s intrinsic orientation was aligned with the Director, the Matcher, or neither partner. Memory tests preceding descriptions revealed that Directors misaligned with the structure organized information according to a priori knowledge, being more likely to use the structure as an organizing orientation when knowing that Matchers were aligned with it. The perspective of Directors’ descriptions was also influenced both by the partners’ alignment with the structure and their advance knowledge of that. Altogether, speakers are guided by converging social and representational cues to adapt flexibly the organization of their memories and perspectives of their descriptions.",>Alexia Galati>Marios N.

This study presents data from a referential communication experiment the manipulates contextual factors such as the availability of feedback and role constancy in order to investigate how conversational partners reconcile their perspectives in the face of mutual uncertainty about what constitutes common ground.

2013,Production of referring expressions: Preference trumps discrimination,"When referring to an object using a description, speakers need to select properties which jointly distinguish it from any potential distractors. Previous empirical and computational work addressing this content selection process has highlighted the role of both (i) the discriminatory power of properties of a referent, i.e. how many of the distractors in a domain each property excludes; (ii) how inherently salient or preferred a property is. To date, there has been no attempt to systematically investigate the trade-o between these two potentially competing motivations. This paper investigates experimentally the extent to which speakers take discriminatory power versus preference into account during content selection for reference production. Our results suggest that discriminatory power in fact plays a relatively unimportant role.

Humans perceive hierarchical structure even in stimuli with two or three moving dots. An influential theory of hierarchical motion perception holds that the visual system performs a ""vector analysis"" of moving objects, decomposing them into common and relative motions. However, this theory does not specify how to resolve ambiguity when a scene admits more than one vector analysis. We describe a Bayesian theory of vector analysis and show that it can account for classic results from dot motion experiments.

This study contrasts two proposals that make different predictions about the interaction between spatial and temporal magnitudes. Whereas ATOM implies that their relation is symmetric, Metaphor Theory claims it is asymmetric. We investigated whether space and time activate overlapping areas of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and whether they do so symmetrically or asymmetrically. We measured participants’ neural activity while they made temporal and spatial judgments on identical visual stimuli. The behavioral results replicated earlier observations of a space-time asymmetry: Spatial information influenced temporal judgments more than vice versa. The BOLD data indicated that space and time activated overlapping IPC clusters and that, consistent with Metaphor Theory, this activation was asymmetric: The shared region of IPC was activated more during temporal than during spatial judgments. We consider three possible interpretations of this neural asymmetry, based on 3 possible functions of IPC.",>Tom Gijssels>Roberto Bottini>Shirley-Ann Rueschemeyer>Daniel Casasanto,">The New School for Social Research, New York, New York, USA; Donders Center for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; MPI for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>The New School for Social Research; Donders Center for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; MPI for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>York University; Donders Center for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>The New School for Social Research; Donders Center for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; MPI for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0113/index.html

The task involves the control of a single output variable via multiple and uncertain input controls.

The present study aimed to examine these issues, with a focus on the role of representational change and executive function development. Across two time points spaced approximately 7 months apart, children’s category-based reasoning was assessed along with a battery of executive function and representational change measures.

2013,'This is a wall' – Assigning Function to Objects,"Construction tasks involve numerous demanding sub-tasks such as creating a mental model of the goal object and integrating the object parts into this model. For this purpose object parts need to be assigned a function within the overall structure. In this paper we examine the linguistic represen- tation of this process. Participants were given 16 object parts to assemble without a manual, and were asked to think aloud while doing so. Depending on condition they were not given any specific information, or told that the goal object was a dollhouse, or shown a picture of the dollhouse. In a second study, participants were asked to instruct a partner to assemble the dollhouse. Results of our linguistic analysis of think-aloud data and instructions reveal three strategies of assigning function to objects, one of which occurred exclu- sively in instructions. With less specific information about the goal object, functions were more often assigned explicitly. In these cases function tended to relate to the overall structure (e.g. ‘house’) rather than to structural parts (e.g. ‘wall’).",>Linn Gralla>Thora Tenbrink,">Universität Bremen, Germany>Bangor University, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0116/index.html

In this study, we examined alternative ways to train experimental participants to control and optimize their use of electricity by “feedforward” training to map energy consuming behaviors to costs. The participants were trained in one of four experimental conditions, one feedback (“IHD”) and three feedforward conditions before they had to control the electricity consumption in a simulated household. Results showed that one of the feedforward conditions produced somewhat higher utility and as good or better satisfaction of a monthly budget than the feedback training condition, despite never receiving any feedback about the monthly cost, but the generalization to a new budget constraint proved to be slightly poorer.",>Mona Guath>Peter Juslin>Philip Millroth,>Uppsala University>Uppsala University>Uppsala University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0117/index.html

We investigated the primary driving force behind such altruistic cooperation. In Experiment 1, we replicated previous findings indicating that the key mechanism contributing to the emergence of altruistic cooperation is fairness considerations.

2013,A Probabilistic Constraint Satisfaction Model of Information Distortion in Diagnostic Reasoning,"Information distortion is a cognitive bias in sequential diagnostic reasoning. Assumptions about the diagnostic validity of later evidence are distorted in favor of the leading hypothesis. Therefore the bias contributes to a primacy effect. Current parallel constraint satisfaction models account for order effects and coherence shifts, but do not explain information distortion. As an alternative a new, probabilistic constraint satisfaction model is proposed, which considers uncertainty about diagnostic validity by defining probability distributions over coherence relations. Simulations based on the new model show that by shifting distributions in favor of the leading hypothesis an increase in coherence can be achieved. Thus the model is able to explain information distortion by assuming a need for coherence. It also accounts for a number of other recent findings on clinical diagnostic reasoning.

We here investigated the return path with landmarks located on different positions (optimal, suboptimal). Participants learned a total of 24 routes and had to produce the return paths (N=20). In a second experiment the different positions plus map learning versus verbal directions were investigated (N=20). Both experiments reveal that the position of a landmark at an intersection (structural salience) has an influence on wayfinding performance. However, the results are somehow ambiguous. Therefore, we also present first approaches for predicting behavior (e.g., optimal route descriptions) and for modeling the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in finding the return path, including visibility, structural salience, mental representation/ transformation, and language.",>Kai Hamburger>Lena E.

Perceptual dominance times are highly variable between individuals and may be partially influenced by genetic factors. This study examined the role of putative genetic effects associated with familial sinistrality, derived from a novel pedigree-based genetic model. In a continuous Necker viewing task, dominance times were significantly correlated (R-square = .36) with a multifactorial estimate of genetic effects associated with non right-handedness. No association with genetic estimates was found in an intermittent viewing condition.

In one recent study, Miller et al. (2012), re-analyzed data from a large number of free-recall experiments and identified intrusions as a factor that influenced search termination decisions. One potential problem with this re-analysis is that all the data were drawn from experiments in which it was impossible to determine if or when search was terminated. Using data from experiments in which search termination decisions were directly measured, we confirmed Miller at al.'s (2012) original findings but also demonstrated that intrusions influence the time taken to generate the final retrieval and the time between the final retrieval and search termination. The pattern of data is consistent with a simple, sample-with-replacement model in which intrusions are less active than items from the target list.",>J.

Theorists have differed as to whether these phenomena are driven by complex, online inference processes or by relatively rote rules. The present study uses ERP to explore the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in scalar implicature (the inference that, e.g., “some” indicates “some but not all”), a test case that has been subject to considerable behavioral research but limited neuropsychological research. Our results challenge both rote-processing and rich-inference accounts. We provide the first ERP results showing that scalar implicature processing depends on context, challenging rote-processing theories of implicature. However, we also fail to find evidence of a processing cost associated with implicature processing, as predicted by many rich-inference accounts.

Experiment 1b showed that description of relevant distributional information produced similar facilitation to sequential sampling. These results indicate that causal and sampling approaches impact on different components of probability judgment.,>Brett Hayes>Ben Newell>Guy Hawkiins,>University of New South Wales>University of New South Wales>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0125/index.html
2013,"The Role of Familiarity, Priming and Perception in Similarity Judgments","We present a novel way of accounting for similarity judgments. Our approach posits that similarity ratings stem from three main sources: familiarity, priming, and inherent perceptual similarity. We present a process model of our approach in the cognitive architecture ACT-R, and match our model's predictions to data collected from a human subject experiment which involved simple perceptual stimuli. Familiarity accounts for rising ratings over time; priming accounts for asymmetric effects that arise when the stimuli are shown with different frequencies. Pure perceptual similarity also predicts trends in the results. Overall, our model matched the data with R^2 of 0.99.",>Laura Hiatt>Greg Trafton,>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0126/index.html
2013,Large-Scale Empricial Analyses of the Abstract/Concrete Distinction,"We present original evidence that abstract and concrete concepts are organized and represented differently, based on statistical analyses of thousands of concepts in publicly available datasets. First, we show that abstract and concrete concepts have differing patterns of association with other concepts. Second, we test recent hypotheses that abstract concepts are organized according to association, whereas concrete concepts are organized according to (semantic) similarity. Third, we present evidence suggesting that concrete representations are more strongly feature-based than abstract representations. We argue that degree of feature- based structure may fundamentally determine concreteness, and discuss implications for cognitive and computational models of meaning.",>Felix Hill>Anna Korhonen>Christian Bentz,>University of Cambridge>University of Cambridge>University of Cambridge,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0127/index.html
2013,How Episodic and Working Memory Affect Rule- and Memory-Based Judgments,"Making accurate judgments is an essential skill in everyday life. However, little is known about the basic cognitive skills required for accurate judgments. Research on judgment and categorization processes suggests that people rely on various strategies when making judgments. These strategies differ in the cognitive abilities they require. Specifically high working memory capacity may benefit rule-based judgments, whereas good long-term memory may be crucial for memory-based judgments. We investigated this hypothesis following an individual differences approach. 177 participants performed two judgment tasks that were either best solved by a rule-based or a memory-based strategy. Additionally, we measured working memory capacity and episodic memory with three tests. Consistent with our hypothesis structural equation modeling showed that working memory capacity predicted judgment accuracy in the rule-based task whereas episodic memory predicted judgment accuracy in the memory-based task. Apparently, different memory abilities are essential for successfully adopting different judgment strategies.",>Janina A.

In Study 1 (N=101) 3- and 4-year-olds trusted speakers based on their current, rather than previous, intentions to give in/correct information. Thus preschoolers infer the meanings behind different intentions and recognize that intentions change within individuals over time. In Study 2 (N=80) 3- to 5-year-olds trusted speakers who were currently sincere, but previously intentionally inaccurate, rather than currently sincere, but previously ignorant, showing that preschoolers infer current knowledge from prior intentions. Preschoolers also trusted speakers who were currently knowledgeable, although previously ignorant, showing that they recognize knowledge is variable within individuals.",>Elena Hoicka>Jessica Butcher>Felicity Malla>Paul Harris,>University of Sheffield>University of Stirling>University of Stirling>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0129/index.html
2013,When Is Language a Window into the Mind? Looking Beyond Words to Infer Conceptual Categories,"Language is often regarded as a rich source of evidence about the mind. However, a number of findings challenge this position, at least at the level of words: Where languages differ in their lexical distinctions, conceptual differences are not always observed. We ask here how language might serve as a window into the mind despite an apparently loose connection between words and concepts. We propose that prominent conceptual distinctions, though not necessarily captured by individual words, may be revealed by elements of meaning shared by multiple words. Testing this hypothesis in the domain of space, we show that clusters of spatial terms, identified through dimensionality reduction analyses of semantic similarity data, align with conceptual categories spontaneously accessed during the perceptual discrimination of spatial relations. These findings suggest that aspects of semantic structure beyond the level of words may provide considerable insight into the conceptual system. Implications for research on linguistic relativity are discussed.",>Kevin Holmes>Phillip Wolff,">University of California, Berkeley>Emory University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0130/index.html

Although there is some evidence that young children reason appropriately about others' discrepant preferences, there are reasons to suspect this ability remains fragile through the preschool years. In particular, we argue that the way preferences are expressed may tap into humans' lifelong tendency toward naïve realism, the belief that my way of seeing the world is the normative, correct one. We present data demonstrating that tolerance for unconventional opinions increases during the preschool years but remains susceptible to influence by linguistic framing.",>Taylor Holubar>Ellen Markman,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA>Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0131/index.html

In two experiments, we tested this explanation by presenting the dilemmas and measuring participants’ reactions using a self-report emotion measure (PANAS-X). As might be expected, participants experienced more intense emotions after reading moral dilemmas when compared to a non-moral dilemma. However, participants’ emotional reactions to the Trolley and Footbridge dilemmas did not differ.

Here we investigate children’s sensitivity to the place- ment of novel labels within discourse structure as a possible mechanism for word learning. In Experiment 1, children ages 2–6 years participated in word learning trials featuring two novel items and one novel label. In critical trials, the labels were embedded between two sentences about the same item, whereas in a control condition, the label was introduced after two sentences about the item. Children of all ages were more likely to attribute the label to the toy whose descriptions brack- eted the embedded label, and response strength increased with age. Children across all ages responded at chance in the control condition. In Experiment 2, adults showed the same patterns of responses as children in both critical and control conditions. Together, these results suggest that discourse continuity is a reliable cue to reference for both children and adults.",>Alexandra Horowitz>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0134/index.html

We present a neural architecture for categorizing visual stimuli based on the Neural Engineering Framework and the manipulation of semantic pointers. The model accounts for how the visual system computes semantic representations from raw images, and how those representations are then manipulated to produce category judgments. All computations of the model are carried out in simulated spiking neurons. We demonstrate that the model matches human performance on two seminal behavioural studies of image-based concept acquisition: Posner and Keele (1968) and Regehr and Brooks (1993).",>Eric Hunsberger>Peter Blouw>James Bergstra>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0136/index.html
2013,How to improve on Quinian bootstrapping - a response to nativist objections,"Quinian bootstrapping is Susan Carey's solution to Fodor’s paradox of concept learning. Carey claims that contrary to Fodor’s view, not all learning amounts to hypothesis testing, and that there are ways in which even primitive concepts can be learned. Recently Georges Rey has argued that Carey’s attempt to refute radical concept nativism is unsuccessful. First it cannot explain how the expressive power of mental representational systems could increase due to learning. Second, both Fodorian circularity charges and Goodmanian problems of indeterminacy apply to Carey’s examples of Quinian bootstrapping. I argue that Carey’s examples of bootstrapping can be amended to escape Fodorian and Goodmanian objections. I suggest some ways to improve on our models of concept learning to this end. I also argue that skill learning is the way for mental representational systems to increase their own expressive power, that is, to enrich their conceptual repertoire beyond what compositionality alone affords.",>Zoltan Jakab,">Loránd Eötvös University, Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0137/index.html

The majority of participants spontaneously gestured while reading the descriptions, and most of those also gestured while answering true-false questions. They did not gesture proportionately more time for environments with many landmarks than for environments with few. Their gestures laid out the environments, primarily using points to places and lines for paths. Descriptions and questions accompanied by gestures were remembered more accurately.

Based on evidence that comparison-derived schema abstraction can improve relational retrieval, we asked whether the use of relational labels can also promote abstraction and improve relational retrieval. Using a cued-recall paradigm, we varied the presence of relational labels at encoding and test. As compared to a no-label baseline condition, relational retrieval improved when relational labels were given at encoding and at test and also when relational labels were given only at encoding. The findings demonstrate that one way to improve relational retrieval is through the use of labels that name relational structure.",>Anja Jamrozik>Dedre Gentner,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0139/index.html

In a series of two experiments we found error rates to be sensitive to verbs’ structural preferences and abstract structural priming. The similarities between the behaviour in this task and previous linguistic research suggests that this method may be useful for studying the nature of SL in language learning and processing.,>Marius Janciauskas>Franklin Chang,>University of Liverpool>University of Liverpool,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0140/index.html
2013,"Not so innocent: Reasoning about costs, competence, and culpability in very early childhood","Social evaluations depend on our ability to interpret other people’s behavior. In adults, these evaluations are influenced by our perception of the competence and motivation of the agent: helping when it is difficult to help is praiseworthy; not helping when it is easy to help is reprehensible. Here we look at young children’s capacity to make competence attributions and its relation to their social evaluations. We find that as early as 18-months, infants can use the time and effort associated with achieving a goal-directed action to distinguish agents, and that infants prefer more competent agents. When asked to choose between two agents who act as moral bystanders and refuse to engage in a helpful action, we find a sustained preference for the more competent agent until the age of three, when the preference is reversed. We argue that the ability to calculate the cost and benefits of goal-directed action originates in early childhood and plays a fundamental role in moral reasoning.",>Julian Jara-Ettinger>Joshua Tenenbaum>Laura Schulz,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0141/index.html

Here, we consider the statistical structure of visual input during these two years. Infants spanning the ages from 1 to 24 months wore body-mounted video cameras for 6 hours at home as they engaged in their daily activities. Our data strongly suggest that the statistical structure of the learning environment is dynamic and ordered. The available visual statistics are not stationary, but rather they are gated by young children's developmental level. We find a rolling wave of ""See-Saw"" patterns over developmental time in two classes of important social stimuli: First faces, then hands; and within hands, first other-then-self-then-touching-then-holding. These ordered environments may help learning systems “start small,” find the optimal path to the optimal solution, and determine the architecture of the system that does the learning.",>Swapnaa Jayaraman>Caitlin Fausey>Linda Smith,">Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States>Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States>Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0142/index.html
2013,Chinese-speaking adults' understanding of argument structure,"Syntactic constructions roughly correspond to sentence meanings. Previous research has shown that Chinese children can associate an SVO construction with a causative event at age 2, but do not always map an SV construction to a non-causative event even after reaching 5 years of age. The latter results may be attributed to the fact that Chinese allows argument-dropping (Jiang & Haryu, 2010). This paper investigated Chinese adults’ syntax-semantics knowledge and found that even adults do not always map an intransitive construction to a non-causative event, although they are likely to use an intransitive construction to describe a non-causative event. The results suggest that although Chinese adults understand that causative and non-causative events should typically be described using transitive and intransitive constructions, respectively, the use of this knowledge in inferring novel verb meanings seems to be regulated by the actual usage of SV sentences in Chinese.",>Lu Jiang>Etsuko Haryu,">Unversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan>University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0143/index.html

While sparse codes have been the subject of much recent research, they have primarily been evaluated using readily available datasets of natural images and sounds. In comparison, relatively little work has investigated the use of sparse codes for representing information about human movements and poses. This paper proposes a basic architecture for evaluating the impact of sparsity when coding human poses, and tests the performance of several coding methods within this framework for the task of mapping from a kinematic (joint angle) modality to a dynamic (joint torque) one. We show that sparse codes are indeed useful for effective mappings between modalities and examine in detail the sources of error for each stage in the model.",>Leif Johnson>Joseph Cooper>Dana Ballard,">The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA>The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA>The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0144/index.html
2013,A soft barrier model for predicting human visuomotor behavior in a driving task,"We present a task-based model of human gaze allocation in a driving environment. When engaged in natural tasks, gaze is predominantly directed towards task relevant objects. In particular in a multi-task scenario such as driving, human drivers must access multiple perceptual cues that can be used for effective control. Our model uses visual task modules that require multiple independent sources of information for control, analogous to human foveation on different task-relevant objects. Building on the framework described by Sprague and Ballard (2003), we use a modular structure to feed information to a set of PID controllers that drive a simulated car and introduce a barrier model for gaze selection. The softmax barrier model uses performance thresholds to represent task importance across modules and allows noise to be added to any module to represent task uncertainty. Results from the model compare favorably with human gaze data gathered from subjects driving in a virtual environment.",>Leif Johnson>Brian Sullivan>Mary Hayhoe>Dana Ballard,">The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA>Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA>The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA>The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0145/index.html
2013,Meaning Overrides Frequency in Idiomatic and Compositional Multiword Chunks,"In line with usage-based accounts, recent psycholinguistic studies have confirmed that frequency of occurrence impacts processing latencies for multiword strings (e.g., Arnon & Snider, 2010). However, these studies have not been concerned with the meaning of the multiword chunks in question, which is central to accounts of formulaic language rooted in cognitive linguistics (e.g., Wray, 2002). Here, we address this issue by comparing processing latencies for three types of multiword chunks: idiomatic expressions, meaningful compositional phrases, and less meaningful fragments. All three chunk types were matched for whole- and sub-string frequency. Our results show that frequency facilitates processing for all three chunk types, but to a lesser extent than their “meaningfulness” (as assessed in a separate norming study), indicating that the meanings of multiword expressions may have implications for models of language processing which extend beyond those of frequency of occurrence.",>Hajnal Jolsvai>Stewart M.

Those findings suggest that featural and relationl categories have fundamentally different learning algorithms, where relational categories rely on explicit representations and thus require working memory and attention, as opposed to featural categories which may be learned more implicitly. In this study, we investigated further the distinction between feature-and relation-based category learning using a dual task methodology. Our results revealed an interaction: featural category learning was more impaired by a visuospatial dual task than by a verbal dual task, whereas relational category learning was more impaired by the verbal dual task. Our results suggest that in contrast to featural category learning, which may involve mainly non-verbal mechanisms, relational category learning appears to place greater demands on more explicit and attention-demanding verbal or verbally-related learning mechanisms.",>Wookyoung Jung>John Hummel,>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0147/index.html
2013,The Effects of Repeated Sequential Context on Recognition Memory,"Many people have had the experience of knowing what song will play next on an album (even one heard only a few times). Conversely, many people fail to recognize an acquaintance encountered in an unfamiliar context. Associations can likely form simply because items appear nearby in time, and not only due to semantic similarity. Using surprise recognition testing, we examine the automatic storage of associations between successively encountered words on a list of incidentally studied words. Many modern memory models assume storage of such associations, but with little evidence as yet (e.g., Cox & Shiffrin, 2012; REM-II Mueller & Shiffrin, 2006). We find evidence for sequential associations, which are further improved by shared semantics or study context.

2013,More Naturalistic Cross-situational Word Learning,"Previous research has found that people can use word-object co-occurrences from ambiguous situations to learn word meanings (e.g., Yu & Smith, 2007). However, most studies of cross-situational learning present an equal number of words and objects, which may simplify the problem by, for example, encouraging learners to use assumptions such as each word going with one object. This paper presents several conditions in which the number of words and objects do not match: either additional objects appear at random, or objects appear sometimes without their intended words. These manipulations do generally hurt learning in comparison to balanced conditions, but people still learn a significant proportion of word-object pairings. The results are explored in terms of statistics of the training trials—including contextual diversity and context familiarity—and with the uncertainty- and familiarity-biased associative model. Parametric differences between conditions hint at hidden cognitive constructs.",>George Kachergis>Chen Yu,>Leiden University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0149/index.html

With regard to TA instructions, prompted instructions that entailed evaluation prompts (as used in some previous Web search studies) were compared to neutral instructions (in line with the standards defined by Ericsson & Simon, 1993) and to a silent condition. To measure participants' (N = 44) information processing and source evaluation we used a rich multi-method approach including eye-tracking methodologies, log file data, and verbal protocols. Results indicate that prompted TA instructions as compared to neutral instructions significantly increased participants' verbal reflections on information quality and on structural aspects of Web pages, given that participants possessed at least a moderate level of prior domain knowledge. In addition, prompted instructions resulted in less linear viewing sequences on the search engine results pages than the silent condition. Finally, the higher participants' prior domain knowledge the more intensely they scrutinized the search results presented by the search engine and the smaller were their average pupil sizes, which indicated lower cognitive load. The significance of the results is considered in light of methodological as well as educational implications.",>Yvonne Kammerer>Peter Gerjets,>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0150/index.html

We hypothesized that involvement of intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in this network is specialized for processing numeric rather than monetary value. To test our hypothesis, we manipulated numeric magnitude and units to construct a range of economic rewards (e.g., +$1, +100¢) in response to simple decisions. Consistent with our hypothesis, BOLD activity in IPS was related to changes in numeric magnitude, independent of monetary value, whereas activity in OFC was associated with monetary value, independent of numeric magnitude. Finally, by using representation similarity analysis, we found that the information represented in IPS and OFC was more consistent with the patterns expected if representations of numeric magnitudes or monetary values, respectively, were in a compressive scale. Together, these findings show the importance of numerical cognition for understanding how the brain processes monetary rewards.",>Frank Kanayet>John Opfer>William Cunningham,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0151/index.html

Humor theorists posit that incongruity---perceiving a situation from different viewpoints and finding the resulting interpretations to be incompatible---contributes to sensations of mirth. In this paper, we use a computational model of sentence comprehension to formalize incongruity and test its relationship to humor in puns. By combining a noisy channel model of language comprehension and standard information theoretic measures, we derive two dimensions of incongruity---ambiguity of meaning and distinctiveness of viewpoints---and use them to predict humans' judgments of funniness. Results showed that both ambiguity and distinctiveness are significant predictors of humor. Additionally, our model automatically identifies specific features of a pun that make it amusing. We thus show how a probabilistic model of sentence comprehension can help explain essential features of the complex phenomenon of linguistic humor.",>Justine T. Kao>Roger Levy>Noah D.

2013,What They Don't know Might Help Them: A Demonstration of Subtle Social Inference from Mimicry,"Mimicry and imitation are crucial mechanisms of social learning and rapport. Further, mimicry informs essential social judgments formed not only by the interacting party but also by third-party observers. How sophisticated are observer’s inferences from mimicry? We examined this in the context of observers’ use of mimicry to judge trustworthiness. Participants observed a dyadic interaction in which a target mimicked or did not mimic a model. Prior to observation, the model’s honesty was earlier defamed, or praised, in front of some, but not other, targets. Observers always knew the model’s reputation. Observers also knew which targets were aware of the model’s reputation. Results suggest that observers’ use of mimicry in trust judgments is very sophisticated It reflects not just the presence of mimicry, but also the model’s moral reputation and, critically, knowledge of the target’s awareness of the model’s reputation. This sophistication leads observers to rate targets as trustworthy when they mimic untrustworthy models, but only when the observers know that the model reputation is unknown to the target.",>Liam Kavanagh>Giti Bakhtiari>Chris Suhler>Patricia Churchland>Rob Holland>Piotr Winkielman,">University of California, San Diego>University of Würzburg>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>Radboud University Nijmegen>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0153/index.html

We found that Chinese managers were more likely than US managers to categorize attempts to outperform others as an instance of both competition and cooperation. Further, the Chinese managers were more likely than the US managers to perceive a given working relationship as being both cooperative and competitive. The two findings were linked: culturally-guided beliefs about whether the cooperation-competition paradox should be integrated or kept separate influenced how individuals understood their social relationships. More broadly, the implication is that category membership and relations between categories are guided by cultural influences distinct from the particulars of the categories themselves that normally enter into cognitive science research on categories.

2013,"Musicality and non-native speech sound processing are linked through temporal, pitch and spectral acuity","Are observed links between musicality and non-native speech sound processing due to superior sensory processing of temporal, pitch, and spectral information, which benefits both musical and linguistic processing? Native English speakers discriminated Norwegian tonal contrasts, non-linguistic pure-tone analogues, Norwegian vowels, and short tones differing in temporal, pitch and spectral characteristics. Musicality was measured using Gordon’s (1989) Advanced Measures of Musical Audiation (AMMA). After controlling for effects of sex, non-verbal IQ and previous language learning experience, the link between AMMA scores and tonal contour discrimination was partially mediated by pitch acuity. In addition, tonal contrast, pitch contour and vowel discrimination were predicted by temporal and spectral acuity. No independent effects of musical training were found. Thus, links between musicality and non-native speech sound processing appear to be mainly due to superior temporal, pitch or spectral acuity, which, in turn, may play somewhat different roles in processing different speech sounds.",>Vera Kempe>Dennis Bublitz>Patricia J.

2013,Maximizing Students' Retention Via Spaced Review: Practical Guidance From Computational Models Of Memory,"During the school semester, students face an onslaught of new material. Students work hard to achieve initial mastery of the material, but soon their skill degrades or they forget. Although students and educators both appreciate that review can help stabilize learning, time constraints result in a trade off between acquiring new knowledge and preserving old knowledge. To use time efficiently, when should review take place? Experimental studies have shown benefits to long-term retention with spaced study, but little practical advice is available to students and educators about the optimal spacing of study. The dearth of advice is due to the challenge of conducting experimental studies of learning in educational settings where material is introduced in blocks over the time frame of a semester. In this paper, we turn to two established models of memory---ACT-R and MCM---to conduct simulation studies exploring the impact of study schedule on long-term retention. Based on the premise of fixed time each week to review, converging evidence from the two models suggests that an optimal review schedule obtains significant benefits over haphazard (suboptimal) review schedules. Further, we identify two scheduling heuristics that obtain near optimal review performance: (1) review the material from u-weeks back, and (2) review material whose predicted memory strength is closest to theta. The former has implications for classroom instruction and the latter for the design of electronic tutors.",>Mohammad Khajah>Robert Lindsey>Michael Mozer,">University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States>University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States>University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0157/index.html
2013,"Spatial terms across languages support near-optimal communication: Evidence from Peruvian Amazonia, and computational analyses","Why do languages have the categories they do? It has been argued that spatial terms in the world’s languages reflect categories that support highly informative communication, and that this accounts for the spatial categories found across languages. However, this proposal has been tested against only nine languages, and in a limited fashion. Here, we consider two new languages: Máíhɨki, an under-documented language of Peruvian Amazonia, and English. We analyze spatial data from these two new languages and the original nine, using thorough and theoretically targeted computational tests. The results support the hypothesis that spatial terms across dissimilar languages enable near-optimally informative communication, over an influential competing hypothesis.",>Naveen Khetarpal>Grace Neveu>Asifa Majid>Lev Michael>Terry Regier,>University of Chicago>UC Berkeley>Radboud University>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0158/index.html
2013,Cooperative Strategies with Incongruent Facial Expressions Cause Cardiovascular Threat,"Affect is important in motivated performance situations such as negotiation. Longstanding theories of emotion suggest that facial expressions provide enough information to perceive another person’s internal affective state. Alternatively, the contextual emotion hypothesis posits that situational factors bias the perception of emotion in others’ facial displays. This hypothesis predicts that individuals will have different perceptions of the same facial expression depending upon the context in which the expression is displayed. In this study, cardiovascular indexes of motivational states (i.e., challenge vs. threat) were recorded while players engaged in a multi-issue negotiation where the opposing negotiator (confederate) displayed emotional facial expressions (angry vs. happy); the confederate’s negotiation strategy (cooperative vs. competitive) was factorially crossed with his facial expression. During the game, participants’ eye fixations and cardiovascular responses, indexing task engagement and challenge/threat motivation, were recorded. Results indicated that participants playing confederates with incongruent facial expressions (e.g., cooperative strategy, angry face) exhibited a greater threat response, which arises due to increased uncertainty. Eye fixations also suggest that participants look at the face more in order to acquire information to reconcile their uncertainty in the incongruent condition. Taken together, these results suggest that context matters in the perception of emotion.",>Peter Khooshabeh>Celso de Melo>Brooks Volkman>Jonathan Gratch>Jim Blascovich>Peter Carnevale,>USC Institute for Creative Technologies>USC Marshall School of Business>UC Santa Barbara Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences>USC Institute for Creative Technologies>UC Santa Barbara Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences>USC Marshall School of Business,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0159/index.html
2013,A model of population dynamics applied to phonetic change,"We consider the problem of language evolution in a population setting, focusing on the case of continuous parameter learning. While theories of phonetic change tend to emphasize the types of transmission errors that could give rise to a shift in pronunciation norms, it is challenging to develop a model that allows for both stability as well as change. We model the acquisition of vowel-to-vowel coarticulation in both single- and multiple-teacher settings, considering progressively more restrictive prior learning biases. We demonstrate that both stability and change are possible at the population level, but only under fairly strong assumptions about the nature of learning and production biases.",>James Kirby>Morgan Sonderegger,>University of Edinburgh>McGill University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0160/index.html
2013,Do older Gaelic-English bilinguals show an advantage in inhibitory control?,"We examined whether a bilingual advantage can be found in older bilinguals that share the same cultural background with monolinguals. Sixteen Gaelic-English bilinguals over the age of 60 years were compared with three monolingual control groups in performance on the Simon task, as well as in general intelligence and socio-economic status. Some of the monolinguals were bidialectal allowing us to also test whether switching between dialects can incur similar cognitive benefits as bilingualism. Results showed no group differences in overall reaction times as well as in the Simon effect suggesting that individuals that share a cultural background may not exhibit differences in inhibitory control even if they routinely use another dialect or another language. This opens up the possibility that other factors associated with bilingualism, like immigrant status, may be responsible for the bilingual advantage found in some but not in other studies.",>Neil Kirk>Kenneth Scott-Brown>Vera Kempe,">University of Abertay Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom>University of Abertay Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom>University of Abertay Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0161/index.html
2013,Bayesian Speech Production: Evidence from Latency and Hyperarticulation,"Both response latency and phonetic variation reflect competition among alternatives during the speech production process. A review of the literature finds an apparent contradiction in the latency results. In some tasks where latency is measured, similarity between targets and competitors results in slower reaction times. In other tasks, similar competitors appear to facilitate production times relative to non-similar competitors (though a lack of any competition at all results in the shortest response latencies). With respect to phonetic realization, experiments suggest that high levels of competition induced by sufficiently similar competitors result in hyperarticulation of target utterances. We present a Bayesian model of speech production that formalizes the selection and planning of spoken forms as noisy-channel communication among different levels of processing. The model resolves the apparent contradiction found in the latency results, and establishes a novel connection between those results and observed patterns of hyperarticulation.",>Christo Kirov>Colin Wilson,>Johns Hopkins University>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0162/index.html
2013,Transitive and periphrastic sentences affect memory for simple causal scenes,"Can linguistic structures influence how people perceive and remember causal events? Using a change-detection method, we presented participants with direct causal scenes paired with either transitive (He stretched the toy) or periphrastic sentences (He made the toy stretch.) Participants then viewed movies with changes to the manner of action (stretching the toy with palms up vs. down), the result (stretching it a shorter vs. longer distance), or no change. Participants judged whether the two movies were identical. Reading periphrastic sentences made people more likely to notice a change in manner than a change in result. Reading transitive sentences had the reverse effect – participants were more likely to notice changes in result. This work provides an important advance in our understanding of how rich conceptual representations map into the grammatical structures of language. We discuss how this novel method can provide insight into the nonlinguistic representations recruited by particular sentence structures.",>Melissa Kline>Paul Muentener>Laura Schulz,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0163/index.html
2013,Semantic Distance Modulates the N400 Event-Related Potential in Verbal Analogical Reasoning,"Computational accounts have traditionally focused on mapping between structured representations as fundamental to analogical processing. However, a recent connectionist model has been used to argue that structured representations may not be necessary to solve verbal analogies. Green and colleagues (2010) have shown that brain areas associated with analogical mapping become more engaged as semantic distance increases between verbal analogy source and targets. Herein, we had participants verify verbal analogies characterized for semantic distance while we monitored their brain waves using EEG. Our results suggest that the semantic distance between the source and target of a verbal analogy does influence early semantic processing as reflected in the N400 Event-Related Potential. However, successfully differentiating valid and invalid verbal analogies engages areas of prefrontal cortex widely associated with inhibitory processing and the integration of abstract relations in working memory. Thus, it appears that traditional semantic priming alone is likely insufficient to explain the full extent of analogical processing.",>Matthew J. Kmiecik>Robert G.

2013,Multiple Proposal Memory in Observational Word Learning,"The temporal co-occurrence of a novel word and a visual referent undoubtedly facilitates establishing the meaning of a word. It is less understood, however, how precisely learners can keep track of the frequencies of these co-occurrences across situations. Observational learning may rely on one or few highly informative exposures (propose-but-verify) or it may be driven by the collection of evidence in a more gradual and parallel manner (multiple-hypotheses tracking). We evaluated both hypotheses within two experiments and found that learners were able to keep track of more than one hypothesis for a novel word. However, this memory was strongly dependent on each learner’s individual learning path (i.e., which meanings they had considered before) and influ-enced by the order of presentation of potential referents. We argue for an account of a multiple-proposal memory rather than a multiple co-occurrence memory.",>Judith Koehne>John C. Trueswell>Lila R.

According to the somatic marker hypothesis, emotion- based signals guide our decisions in uncertain environments outside awareness. However, evidence for this claim can be questioned on the grounds of inadequate assessments of conscious knowledge. Post-decision wagering, in which participants make wagers on the correctness of their decisions, has been recently proposed as an objective and sensitive measure of conscious content. In the experiments reported here, we employed variations of a classic decision-making paradigm, the Iowa Gambling Task, in combination with wagering in order to investigate the role played by unconscious influences. We also examined biases that affect wagering strategies such as the definition of the optimal strategy and loss aversion. Our results demonstrate the inadequacy of post-decision wagering as a direct measure of conscious knowledge and also question the claim that implicit processes influence decision-making.",>Emmanouil Konstantinidis>David Shanks,>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0166/index.html
2013,The impact of bottom-up and top-down saliency cues on reference production,"This study investigates to what extent visual saliency cues in realistic visual scenes cause speakers to include a redundant color attribute in their definite descriptions of objects, and in particular how such cues guide speakers in determining which objects in the scene are relevant distractors, and which not. First, regarding bottom-up cues, the results revealed that the presence of clutter positively affected the redundant use of color, but that the distance between a target and a distractor did not have an effect in this respect. Second, an effect of top-down saliency (i.e., whether a target’s type was mentioned in the instructions) was only partially borne out by the data. We argue that these findings are problematic for algorithms that aim to generate psychologically realistic object descriptions, since these generally select properties that help to distinguish a target from all distractors that are present in a scene.",>Ruud Koolen>Emiel Krahmer>Marc Swerts,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0167/index.html

2013,Space and Time are Mutually Contagious in Sound,"Time is talked about in terms of space more frequently than the opposite is true. Past experimental evidence suggests that this asymmetry runs deep, with results suggesting that temporal concepts and percepts find structure in spatial representations but not vice versa. However, these studies frequently involve verbal and/or visual stimuli. Because vision makes a privileged contribution to spatial processing it is unclear whether these results speak to a deep asymmetry between time and space, or a modality specific one. The present study was motivated by this ambiguity and a complementary correspondence between audition and temporal processing. In an auditory perceptual task, duration and spatial displacement judgments were shown to be mutually contagious. Irrelevant temporal information influenced spatial judgments and vice versa with a larger effect of time on space. The results suggest that the perceptual asymmetry between domains does not generalize across modalities and that time is not fundamentally more abstract than space.",>Alexander Kranjec>Matthew Lehet>Anjan Chatterjee,>Duquesne University>Carnegie Mellon University>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0169/index.html
2013,"Competition, event comprehension, and dynamic location information in sentence processing","Two experiments in the visual world paradigm investigated competition in sentence processing from dynamic event-related information about location. In Experiment 1, listeners viewed visual arrays with container objects like a bowl, jar, pan, and jug, while they heard sentences like “The boy will pour the sweetcorn from the bowl into the jar, and he will pour the gravy from the pan into the jug. But first/And then, he will taste the sweetcorn.” While “But first” contexts referred to the “source” location of the discourse-final noun (e.g., “sweetcorn”), “And then” contexts referred to its “goal” location. In Experiment 2, listeners always heard “And then” contexts. We found that listeners rapidly fixated context-relevant locations. Crucially, they also fixated locations that were context-irrelevant, but related to the discourse-final noun, suggesting object competition, or consistent with abstract location information implied by “But first” (source) or “And then” (goal), suggesting location competition.",>Anuenue Kukona>Gerry T.

We used as a test case the construction “It looks like an X” pronounced either with (a) a nuclear pitch accent on the final noun, or (b) a contrastive L+H* pitch accent and a rising boundary tone, a contour that can support a complex contrastive inference (e.g., It LOOKS like a zebra...(but it is not)). The contrastive intonational contour elicited higher proportions of fixations to non-prototypical target pictures (e.g., a zebra-like animal) during the earliest moments of processing the target noun. Further, when the display only contained a single related pair of pictures, effects of the contrastive accent on “looks” emerged prior to the target noun, indicating that efficient referential resolution is supported by rapidly generated inferences based on visual and prosodic context.",>Chigusa Kurumada>Meredith Brown>Sarah Bibyk>Daniel Pontillo>Michael Tanenhaus,>Stanford University>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0172/index.html
2013,Contextual inferences over speakers' pragmatic intentions: Preschoolers' comprehension of contrastive prosody,"We investigate pre-schoolers’ ability in drawing pragmatic inferences based on prosodic information. Previous work has found that young children are generally oblivious to intonational meaning of utterances. In particular, the ability to comprehend contrastive prosody develops late during language acquisition (after the age of 6). In three experiments, we show that preschoolers can engage in prosody-based pragmatic inferences if the context provides supports for them. Furthermore, we find that preschoolers’ interpretation of prosody involves complex counter-factual reasoning (‘what the speaker would have said if she had intended another meaning’). The picture emerging from our studies contrasts with previous work: Through rich contextual inferences, four-year olds are able to bootstrap their interpretation of prosodic information, and achieve adult like performance in intonation interpretation.",>Chigusa Kurumada,>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0173/index.html
2013,Communicatively efficient language production and case-marker omission in Japanese,"Recent studies hypothesize that language production is governed by the principle of efficient information transmission: speakers tend to omit elements whose information content is contextually predictable while providing more linguistic signal to convey otherwise less predictable information. However, previous findings in support of this hypothesis are also compatible with alternative accounts based on production difficulty. To distinguish between these competing accounts, we conducted experiments on speaker’s preference in optional casemarking in Japanese. The results suggest that Japanese speakers are more likely to omit the object case-marker when an associated noun has semantic properties that are prototypical to a grammatical object. Moreover, case-marker omission was facilitated when other elements in a sentence made the grammatical function assignment more predictable. The results were obtained with all the factors related to production difficulty held constant, and thus support the models of communicatively efficient language production.",>Chigusa Kurumada>T.

2013,Snapshots of Working Memory: Using Early Eye Movements to Capture Temporal Dynamics,"Research investigating top-down attentional capture has demonstrated a tight coupling of working memory content with attention and eye movements. By capitalizing on this relationship, we have developed a novel methodology called the Memory Activation Capture (MAC) procedure for measuring the dynamics of working memory content supporting complex cognitive tasks (e.g., decision making, problem solving). By observing which items are preferentially fixated in task irrelevant arrays containing task relevant information, we gain a measure of working memory content as the task evolves through time. The efficacy of the MAC procedure is demonstrated in a hypothesis generation task. Results suggest a two-stage process following hypothesis retrieval whereby it undergoes a brief period of heightened activation before entering a lower activation state while being maintained for output. The present effects are of additional general interest as they represent the first demonstrations of top-down attentional capture driven by participant-established WM content retrieved from long-term memory.",>Nicholas Lange>Rick Thomas>Daniel Buttaccio>Eddy Davelaar,">University of London, Birkbeck College, London, England>University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA>University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA>University of London, Birkbeck College, London, England",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0175/index.html
2013,Learning Representations of Animated Motion Sequences - A Neural Model,"The detection and categorization of animate motions is a crucial task underlying social interaction and perceptual decision-making. Neural representations of perceived animate objects are built in the primate cortical region STS which is a region of convergent input from intermediate level form and motion representations. Populations of STS cells exist which are selectively responsive to specific animated motion sequences. It is still unclear how and to which extent form and motion information contribute to the generation of such representations and what kind of mechanisms are involved in the learning processes. We demonstrate how the proposed model automatically selects significant motion patterns as well as meaningful static form prototypes. Sequence selective representations are learned in STS by fusing static form and motion input from the segregated bottom-up driving input streams. Cells in STS, in turn, feed activities recurrently to their input sites along top-down signal pathways, enabling predictions about future input.",>Georg Layher>Martin Giese>Heiko Neumann,>Institute of Neural Information Processing / Ulm University>Section for Computational Sensomotorics / University Clinic Tuebingen>Institute of Neural Information Processing / Ulm University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0176/index.html

Theoretical accounts of this effect have debated whether it is due to initial constraints on children’s lexicons (e.g. a principle of mutual exclusivity) or situation-specific pragmatic inferences. We suggest that both could be true. We present a hierarchical Bayesian model that implements both situation-level and hierarchical inference, and show that both can in principle contribute to disambiguation inferences with different levels of strength depending on differ- ences in the situation and language experience of the learner.

Scaffolding is very critical in teaching complex systems. We have two complementary research questions on scaffolding: 1. How can we chunk and sequence the learning activities in teaching complex systems? 2. How can we help students make connections across system levels? A simulation-based environment teaching a chemical system was used as the research instrument, and the study was conducted at a middle school setting. The results showed that the sequencing method following the “from concrete to abstract” principle produced better recall and comprehension of the system concepts (knowledge integration), while the sequencing method aligned with the casual structure of the system facilitated the construction of a better causal model for transfer. The results also demonstrated that explicit level-bridging scaffolding had positive effects on both knowledge integration and learning the deep causal structure.",>Na Li>John Black,>Columbia University>Columbia University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0179/index.html

However, manual construction of such cognitive models is time consuming, and requires domain expertise. Further, manually-constructed models may still miss distinctions in learning which are important for instruction in education. Our prior work proposed an approach that finds cognitive models using a state-of-the-art learning agent, SimStudent, and we demonstrated that, for algebra learning, the agent can find a better cognitive model than human experts. To ensure the generality of that proposed approach, we further apply it to three domains: algebra, stoichiometry, and fraction addition.

However, to what extent generalization is also sufficient to explain the transfer has not been examined.

Later they produce estimates of posterior probability based on the learnt probabilities. The results show that our participants can produce subjective probability estimates that are well calibrated against the normative Bayesian probability and are sensitive to base rates.

We show that this invariance can only be observed if the overall correlation between Raven's and WMC is low. We demonstrate that by using a composite measure of WMC, which yields a higher correlation between WMC and Raven's than reported in previous studies, that there was a significant positive relationship between Raven's item difficulty and the extent of the itemwise correlation with WMC.

We investigated whether having opaque versus mathematically transparent time concepts affects how people reason about time.

Half of the pairs were given roles (“Chef” or “Gatherer”) and the other half were not. Across all participants we found, contrary to the results of static image experiments, that participants spent very little time looking at each other, challenging the generalisability of the conclusions from lab-based paradigms. When given spoken instructions, listeners in the roles condition looked at the speaker significantly more than listeners in the no roles condition.

2013,Social pragmatic factors in reasoning from disjunctions of numerical estimations,"The paper presents two studies that investigated how individuals reason from disjunctive statements that use numerical estimations. In the experiments two types of such statements were used. In the first type both constituents of a disjunction could be a logically correct answer. That is, if “The average life time of a fruit fly is either 9 or 27 days”, any of those numbers is logically possible. In the second type that truth of one constituent excluded the truth of the other, e.g. “The average time of holidays in the EU is either higher than 9 days or else higher than 27 days”. A simple repetition of any of those figures is an illusory inference as it renders both constituents true. The results of Experiment 1 proved that although the participants showed a tendency to repeat one of the disjuncts as their answer, this tendency was smaller when the content of the statements referred to politics and social life in comparison with the general knowledge questions. The results of Experiment 2 showed that individuals reveal the tendency to repeat opinions coming from speakers who are more likeable, even if such opinions are incorrect illusory inferences. The results of both studies show that illusory inferences appear also in the domain of numerical cognition but they may be reduced by pragmatic factors such as the content of the message and the knowledge about its source.",>Robert Mackiewicz>Paweł Koniak,">University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Warsaw, Poland>University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Warsaw, Poland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0189/index.html

2013,A Computational Theory of Subjective Probability [Featuring a Proof that the Conjunction Effect is not a Fallacy],"In this article we demonstrate how algorithmic probability theory is applied to situations that involve uncertainty. When people are unsure of their model of reality, then the outcome they observe will cause them to update their beliefs. We argue that classical probability cannot be applied in such cases, and that subjective probability must instead be used. In Experiment 1 we show that, when judging the probability of lottery number sequences, people apply subjective rather than classical probability. In Experiment 2 we examine the conjunction fallacy and demonstrate that the materials used by Tversky and Kahneman (1983) involve model uncertainty. We then provide a formal mathematical proof that, for every uncertain model, there exists a conjunction of outcomes which is more subjectively probable than either of its constituents in isolation.",>Phil Maguire>Philippe Moser>Rebecca Maguire>Mark Keane,>NUI Maynooth>NUI Maynooth>National College of Ireland>University College Dublin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0191/index.html
2013,Dynamic Structure of Joint-Action Stimulus-Response Activity,"A social Simon effect exists when two individuals perform a Go/No-Go task in the presence of each other, but not when they perform the same task alone. Such effects are argued to indicate that individuals co-represent task goals and the to-be-performed actions of a co-actor. The present study investigates an alternative hypothesis—that these effects are due to dynamical entrainment processes that couple the behavior of socially situated actors. Participants performed a standard Go/No-Go Simon task in joint and individual conditions. The dynamic structure of response times (RTs) was examined using nonlinear methods. Consistent with our hypothesis, the analyses revealed that the structure of RTs in the joint condition indicate interpersonal coupling constraining participant behavior and were more correlated across a range of time-scales compared to the RTs of pseudo-pair controls. The findings imply that dynamic processes might underlie social stimulus-response compatibility effects and shape joint cognitive processes in general.",>MaryLauren Malone>Ramon Castillo>John Holden>Heidi Kloos>Michael Richardson,">University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States; Universidad de Talca, Chile>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0192/index.html
2013,Placing Numbers in Behavioral Space: Activity-Specific Interactions between Number and Space with a Single Response Button,"How are we able to reason about abstract concepts that lie resolutely beyond the reach of perception? One strategy is to ground understanding in space. Numbers, for instance, are known to interact with egocentric space during rapid numerical judgments. A range of experimental results have demonstrated that, among literate Western people, this “mental number-line” goes from left to right, with smaller numbers associated with left space, and larger numbers with right space. But what is the nature of this “space”? Previous work has conflated multiple possible egocentric frames of reference—head-based, eye-based, action-based—leaving it unclear which space is interacting with number. In the present paper, two studies investigated whether a single centrally-located button, stationary in hand- and eye-based coordinates, can nevertheless exhibit different spatial properties in virtue of task-specific activity. In a go/no-go paradigm, participants judged the magnitude (Exp. 1) and parity (Exp. 2) of single-digit numbers. Crucially, they responded only with the index or middle finger of a single hand. While judging magnitude (Exp. 1), participants were faster to respond to smaller numbers with the more leftward finger, and larger numbers with the more rightward finger, regardless of the hand being used. This effect disappeared when judging parity (Exp. 2), replaced by finger-specific associations on the left hand only. In sum, in a task-sensitive way, participants associated numbers with egocentric space—but a behavioral space defined relative to embodied interaction rather than head- or eye-based reference frames. We discuss implications for number representation and the nature of “space” in embodied activity.",>Tyler Marghetis>Jasmeen Kanwal>Benjamin Bergen,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0193/index.html

Due to the rapid onset of this integration, many current K-12 teachers do not have the skills required to supply the sudden demand for technical training. This deficit, in turn, has created a demand for professional development programs that allow working teachers to learn computer science so that they might become qualified to teach this increasingly important field. Subgoal labeled worked examples have been found to improve the performance of learners in highly procedural domains. The present study tested subgoal labeled worked examples in an online learning program for teachers. Teachers who received the subgoal labels solved novel problems more accurately than teachers who received the same worked examples without the subgoal labels. These findings have implications for the use of subgoal labels in professional development, other types of lifelong learning, and online learning.",>Lauren Margulieux>Richard Catrambone>Mark Guzdial,">Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, United States>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0194/index.html

Based on the linguistic theory of Dowty (1991), we propose that agency is a prototype concept. We adapted Dowty’s theory to account for scenarios showing physical interactions. In the standard Michotte launching scenario the ball entering the scene is usually assigned the agent role, whereas the ball that is being launched is viewed as the patient. We showed in two experiments that agency intuitions were moderated by manipulations of the context prior to the launching event. Altering features such as relative movement, sequence of visibility, and self-propelled motion tended to increase agency attributions to the patient relative to the standard scenario. We suspect that shifts in figure-ground perceptions, and intuitions about characteristics of interventions may be the overarching reason for the efficacy of the tested criteria.",>Ralf Mayrhofer>Michael Waldmann,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0197/index.html

Causal models arise from multiple sources of information regarding their constituent parameters. Knowledge sources may be inconsistent both within parameters (when one source says a variable should appear often and another says it should appear rarely), and between parameters (when dependencies among parameters result in an internally inconsistent causal model). We provide a normative model for resolving both these sources of conflict.

This invokes the idea that people have a theory of motion in their heads that is non- Newtonian, and hence leads to systematic errors on these problems. We are able to show that, by selecting our problems carefully, it is possible to obtain answers that are consistent with this naïve physics and inconsistent with it; suggesting that it is not used to solve these problems but sometimes offered as post-hoc justification for the answers given. We offer evidence that the answers given owe more to past experience than any theory, and that a theory that postulates extrapolation on the basis of associative memory can give a good account of our results.",>Ian P.

Typically, studies investigating such tasks provide subjects with precise quantitative information regarding the strength of the relations between causes and effects. By contrast, we examined people’s performance when this information is communicated through qualitative, rather vague verbal terms (e.g., “X occasionally causes symptom A”). We conducted an experiment in which we compared subjects’ judgments with a Bayesian model whose predictions were derived using numeric equivalents of various verbal terms from an unrelated study with different subjects. We found a remarkably close correspondence between subjects’ diagnostic judgments based on verbal information and the model’s predictions, as well as compared to a matched control condition in which information was presented numerically. Additionally, we observed interindividual differences regarding the temporal weighting of evidence.",>Björn Meder>Ralf Mayrhofer,">Center forAdaptive Behavior and Cognition, Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Department of Psychology, University of Göttingen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0200/index.html
2013,Comparative Evidence For Associative Learning In Task Switching,"Humans can perform several different tasks on the same set of stimuli in rapid alternation. Each task, signaled by a distinct task cue, may require the classification of stimuli using a different stimulus attribute. However, such ""task switching"" performance comes at a cost, as expressed by weaker performance when switching rather than repeating tasks. This cost is often claimed to be the consequence of a mental reorientation away from the previous task and towards the new task, requiring executive control of behavior. Alternatively, task switching could simply be based on the retrieval of different cue-stimulus-response associations. In this experiment, pigeons learned go-left/go-right discriminations between grating patterns according to either their spatial frequency or their orientation, depending on the color of the pattern (the task cue). When humans solved the same tasks on the basis of verbalizable rules, they responded more slowly and made more errors on trials where they had to switch between tasks than when repeating the same task. Pigeons did not show this ""switch cost""; but like humans, their performance was significantly worse when the response (left or right) to a given stimulus varied between tasks than when it stayed the same (the “congruency effect”). Larger effects of both switch costs and congruency were observed in humans learning the tasks by trial and error. We discuss the potential driving factors behind these very different patterns of performance for both humans and pigeons.",>Christina Meier>Stephen E. G. Lea>Charlotte L. D.

The Principle of Maximum Entropy indicates that such relations are in fact the ones most probable to be found. For such claims, one needs to compare the correlations with adequate baselines reflecting what would be expected in a purely random system. I then introduce a way of computing such baselines, and use it to show that the correlations found in a corpus are actually weaker than what one would expect to find by chance. Therefore, if an argument were to be made based on them, it would paradoxically be that language is worse for communication than what one would expect to find in a random system. More appropriately however, what these results reflect is that such correlations are not the best places to look for linguistic optimality.",>Fermin Moscoso del Prado,">University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0203/index.html

Study 1 showed that implementers rated a low novelty version of an idea as more creative than a high novelty version, but generators did the opposite. Study 2 showed that generators rated a low usefulness idea as more creative than a high usefulness idea, but implementers did the opposite. Thus, complementary roles prompted competing perspectives.

2013,Simultaneous Contradictory Belief and the Two-Systems Hypothesis,"The two-system hypothesis states that there are two kinds of reasoning systems, the first of which is evolutionarily old, heuristically (or associatively) based, automatic, fast, and is a collection of independent systems. The second is evolutionarily new, perhaps peculiar to humans, is rule-based, controlled, slow, and is a single token system. Advocates of the two-system hypothesis generally support their claim by an inference to the best explanation: two systems are needed to explain experimental data from the reasoning, heuristics, and biases literature. The best evidence for this claim comes from simultaneous contradictory belief (henceforth SCB) (Sloman 1996, 2002). I argue that Sloman has not provided us with cases of SCB. In each of his examples there is no evidence that the beliefs are held simultaneously. I then offer the outline for an experimental setup that would offer compelling evidence for the existence of SCB and thereby support the two-system hypothesis.",>Joshua Mugg,">York University, Toronto, ON, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0205/index.html

The model makes optimal state estimations based on Bayesian estimates of stimuli localization and optimal control decisions of where to fixate in order to maximize task performance. Analysis of the model’s behavior under different task strategies and different constraints on the visual system reveal which aspects of the model are responsible for the effects: the distractor-ratio effects on number of fixations is a signature of optimal state estimation in the face of noisy spatial information, and the saccadic-bias effect is a signature of both optimal control and estimation under these same bounds.",>Christopher Myers>Richard Lewis>Andrew Howes,>Air Force Research Laboratory>University of Michigan>University of Birmingham,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0206/index.html

Results indicate people's inferences are sensitive to the shape of the distribution over the observed events, even when the number of observed events and event types is held constant, and that people are able to infer abstract rules that describe entire classes of event distributions.

In previous studies, we showed that spatial belief revision is often guided by the functional asymmetry between the reference object and the located objects of the spatial relation. Here we first draw a connection between spatial belief revision and grounded cognition. In two experiments, we explored whether imagined physical properties of objects influence which object is relocated and which remains at its initial position. Participants mentally revised beliefs about the arrangement of objects which could be envisaged as small and large (Experiment 1) or easy to move and difficult to move (Experiment 2). The results show that (1) small objects are more often relocated than larger objects and (2) easy to move objects are faster relocated than difficult to move objects.

Our second claim concerns the epistemology of emotion recognition: We demonstrate that emotion recognition is a process pattern recognition that relies on the same type of pattern recognition typical for object recognition. The analogy allows us to defend a variant of a direct perception account of emotion recognition.

2013,"Schema-Driven, Space-Supported Random Accessible Memory Systems for Manipulation of Symbolic Working Memory","We present an execution model for manipulation of working memory content during intellectual symbolic working memory tasks, which allows random access of WM content through a schema-operated sensory-motor spatial working memory. The core concept of this framework is binding symbolic items to spatial locations which are accessible via selective mechanisms of attention in space. An operational schema implements basic WM management operations such as insertion, deletion and fetching through sequences of shifts in spatial attention towards registry locations. We apply the model to a serial recall task (both forward and backward orders). We show that the model provides a better fit to human data in backward recall compared to forward recall, which conforms with the evidence for leveraging spatial strategies for backward recall and phonological strategies for forward recall in normal subjects. We discuss additional possible implications of our model and its assumption of spatial organization of WM content and access through shifts of attention.",>Nader Noori>Laurent Itti,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0212/index.html

The current study tested whether this occurs due to a privileged attentional status of auditory input or due to the dynamic characteristics of auditory input. To address these questions, preschoolers completed one of four discrimination tasks. In the sound, motion, and item baseline conditions, children discriminated these single information types by judging whether paired stimuli were the same or different. In the combined condition, children discriminated changing sounds, motions, or items in the face of competing input in the other two dimensions. Although children’s discrimination of all information types attenuated in the combined condition relative to baseline, motion and item discrimination attenuated more than auditory discrimination. This provides evidence that early in development auditory information receives privileged processing in the face of competing input.",>Allison O'Leary>Vladimir Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0213/index.html

The current study examined how the effects of garden-path sentences and filler-gap dependencies (as indexed by the P600) related to four measures of working memory (reading span, operation span, anti-saccade and n-back). P600 effects for garden-path sentences correlated positively with operation span score while effects for object relatives correlated negatively with n-back accuracy.

However, recent research indicates some shortcomings. Most significantly, questionnaire data are unable to capture developments and changes in students´ goal orientation during the learning process. Therefore, it seems appropriate to supplement questionnaire data with online measures that directly tackle students’ behavior. We analyzed data of 57 students who participated in a study with the Cognitive Tutor Geometry. Specifically, we analyzed relationships between questionnaire data on goal orientation, the use of hints and a glossary while working with the Tutor as potential online indicators for goal orientation, and learning outcomes. Results of our analyses show that our potential online indicators systematically differ from questionnaire data of goal orientation, yet have high predictive power for learning outcomes.

2013,Social categories create (biased) semantic interference during face naming,"Semantic interference in word retrieval has been observed for both well-learned and ad hoc inter-item relations. We tested whether such semantic interference extends to the blocked cyclic naming of racially homogeneous vs. heterogeneous faces. No information except arbitrarily assigned names was provided for novel faces. Yet we observed interference in naming individuals in homogeneous groups. Moreover, consistent with other findings in the social domain, interference occurred for other-race but not for own-race faces. Because this interference effect does not require a rich knowledge base about individuals, it is consistent with the view that interference arises in adjustments to the strength of conceptual-lexical links rather than in knowledge structures themselves. Evidence of modulation by target race further suggests that interference effects may provide an effective tool for exploration of social categorization processes.",>Dominic J Packer>Padraig G O'Seaghdha>Almut Hupbach>Joseph E Bates,>Lehigh University>Lehigh University>Lehigh University>Lehigh University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0216/index.html

Alternatives compete over time, and this competition plays out in sensorimotor processes. This is true not just for perceptual decisions or simple categorisation tasks, but also for moral decisions, which are the outcome of a complex interplay of intuition, emotion and reasoning. In this experiment, we first establish a descriptive and causal link between gaze and moral judgement. We then use eye movements to track the time course of participants’ moral decisions and show that by interrupting their decision process based on their gaze position, we are able to influence what they decide. We interpret this as evidence for a dynamical systems view of decision making and argue that our results provide new insights into how judgements are reached and constructed in our embodied minds.",>Philip Parnamets>Petter Johansson>Christian Balkenius>Lars Hall>Michael J.

A recent trend in alignment research has targeted multimodal alignment, exploring how various communication channels affect one another over time (e.g., Louwerse et al., 2012). While existing research has made significant progress in mapping multimodal alignment during task-based or positively valenced interactions, little is known about the dynamics of multimodal alignment during conflict. We visualize multimodal alignment during naturalistic affiliative and argumentative interactions as networks based on analyses of body movement and speech. Broadly, we find that conversational contexts strongly impact the ways in which interlocutors’ movement and speech systems self-organize interpersonally and intrapersonally.",>Alexandra Paxton>Rick Dale,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0218/index.html

One intriguing question in gesture research has been why gestures take the specific form they do. Previous research has identified the speaker-gesturer’s communicative intent as one factor shaping the form of iconic gestures. Here we investigate whether communicative intent also shapes the form of pointing gestures. In an experimental setting, twenty-four participants produced pointing gestures identifying a referent for an addressee. The communicative intent of the speaker-gesturer was manipulated by varying the informativeness of the pointing gesture. A second independent variable was the presence or absence of concurrent speech. As a function of their communicative intent and irrespective of the presence of speech, participants varied the durations of the stroke and the post-stroke hold-phase of their gesture. These findings add to our understanding of how the communicative context influences the form that a gesture takes.",>David Peeters>Mingyuan Chu>Judith Holler>Aslı Özyürek>Peter Hagoort,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0219/index.html

2013,Eye Gaze Affects Vocal Intonation Mimicry,"Eye gaze and behavioral mimicry are important foundations of social interaction. Inspired by recent studies on eye-gaze me- diated spontaneous behavioral mimicry of gestures, we studied the effect of eye gaze direction on vocal mimicry. Participants were instructed to repeat digits spoken by a virtual agent with a direct or averted eye gaze. As a measure of imitation, the vocal pitch was recorded and analyzed in order to determine if and to what extent vocal mimicry was modulated by eye gaze. The results showed that eye gaze direction affects vocal mimicry as measured by pitch slope. That is, when partici- pants were exposed to an agent that gazed at them directly, they accommodated their intonation more to that of the agent, than when they were exposed to an agent that averted its gaze. These results suggest that in social interaction with a virtual agent, humans mimic vocal intonation and that the degree of mimicry depends on the eye-gaze direction of the agent.

In Experiment 1 (N = 64), participants associated vowel-intrinsic fundamental frequency with size/power, disregarding the modality of stimuli presentation (spoken, written), but depending on the lexical status of the stimulus (more strongly for novel then for existing words). In Experiment 2 (N = 56), we explored the idea that the order of vowels in a word affects sound-symbolic associations, as pitch contours emerge from a sequence of vowel-intrinsic fundamental frequencies. Participants perceived stimuli with 'rising' combinations of front-back vowels as less powerful than stimuli with ‘falling’ combinations. This finding indicates that even in non-tonal languages, sound symbolism is not bound to a single segment (phoneme). We compared the effect to the perception of tones in a tonal language, which we explored in Experiment 3 with Mandarin native speakers (N = 96) judging the perception of power in monosyllabic novel brand names with four different tones (rising, falling, level and fall-rise). In Experiment 4 (N = 146), we examined the effect of vowel-intrinsic intensity, which has previously remained un-noted. The results showed that like fundamental frequency, also intrinsic intensity influences size/power-symbolic associations.",>Marie Postma-Nilsenová>Constantijn Kaland>Leonoor Oversteegen,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0222/index.html
2013,"Justified True Belief Triggers False Recall of ""Knowing""","Philosophers traditionally held that knowledge is justified true belief. Gettier (1963) challenged this view with thought experiments in which someone has a justified and true belief, but an element of luck is involved that disqualifies the belief from counting as knowledge. We examined laypeople’s concept of knowledge using a semantic integration paradigm modeled after that of Gentner (1981). Participants read stories in which a character ‘thought’ something was true. On a subsequent recall task, readers sometimes falsely recalled the verb ‘thought’ as ‘knew,’ implicitly indicating that the reader had attributed knowledge to the character. False recall of ‘knew’ occurred more frequently when the story described a justified true belief than an unjustified belief. Justified true belief triggered these recall errors even in a so-called “Gettier case”. The present findings suggest that semantic integration provides an empirical paradigm suitable for investigating lay notions about knowledge.",>Derek Powell>Zachary Horne>Angel Pinillos>Keith Holyoak,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign>Arizona State University>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0223/index.html
2013,Generic Priors Yield Competition Between Independently-Occurring Causes,"Recent work on causal learning has investigated the possible role of generic priors in guiding human judgments of causal strength. One proposal has been that people have a preference for causes that are sparse and strong—i.e., few in number and individually strong (Lu et al., 2008). Evidence for the use of sparse-and-strong priors has been obtained using a maximally simple causal set-up (a single candidate cause plus unobserved background causes). Here we examine the possible impact of generic priors in more complex, multi- causal set-ups. Sparse-and-strong priors predict that competition can be observed between candidate causes even if they occur independently (i.e., the estimated strength of cause A will be lower if the strength of uncorrelated cause B is high rather than low). Experiment 1 revealed such a cue competition effect in judgments of causal strength. Experiment 2 showed that, as predicted by a Bayesian learning model with sparse-and-strong priors, the impact of the prior diminishes as sample size increases. These findings support the importance of a preference for parsimony as a constraint on causal learning.",>Derek Powell>Alice Merrick>Hongjing Lu>Keith Holyoak,">University of California, Los Angeles, California>University of California, Los Angeles, California>University of California, Los Angeles, California>University of California, Los Angeles, California",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0224/index.html
2013,Beyond backchannels: co-construction of dyadic stancce by reciprocal reinforcement of smiles between virtual agents.,"When two persons participate in a discussion, they not only exchange the concepts and ideas they are discussing, they also express attitudes, feelings and commitments regarding their partner: they express interpersonal stances. Endowed with backchannel model, several virtual agents are able to react to their partners’ behaviour through their non-verbal behaviour. In this paper, we go beyond this approach, proposing and testing a model that enables agents to express a dyadic stance, marker of effective communication: agents will naturally co-construct a shared dyadic stance if and only if their interpersonal stance is reciprocally positive. We focus on smile, which conveys interpersonal stance and is a particularly efficient signal for co-regulation of communication. With this model, a virtual agent, only capable to control its own individual parameters, can, in fact, modulate and control the dyadic stance appearing when it interacts with its partner. The evaluation of the model through a user perceptive study has enabled us to validate that the dyadic stance is significantly perceived as more positive (mutual understanding, attention, agreement, interest, pleasantness) when reinforcement of smile is reciprocal.",>Ken Prepin>Magalie Ochs>Catherine Pelachaud,">CNRS/Telecom-ParisTech, Paris, France>CNRS/Telecom-ParisTech, Paris, France>CNRS/Telecom-ParisTech, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0225/index.html

The category and appearance of everyday materials were varied to assess the extent that participants use these features to inform their judgments about what happens when these materials are mixed with water.

2013,The Myth of Cognitive Decline,"Across a range of psychometric tests, reaction times slow as adult age increases. These changes have been widely taken to show that cognitive-processing capacities decline across the lifespan. Contrary to this, we suggest that slower responses are not a sign of processing deficits, but instead reflect a growing search problem, which escalates as learning increases the amount of information in memory. A series of computational simulations show how age-related slowing emerges naturally in learning models, as a result of the statistical properties of human experience and the increased information-processing load that a lifetime of learning inevitably brings. Once the cost of processing this extra information is controlled for, findings taken to indicate declines in cognitive capacity support little more than the unsurprising idea that choosing between or recalling items becomes more difficult as their numbers increase. We review the implications of this for scientific and cultural understanding of aging.",>Michael Ramscar>Peter Hendrix>Harald Baayen,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0230/index.html

In this experiment, 58 high-school students were randomly assigned to the self-explanation training condition or a control condition (i.e., mnemonic strategies). The learning outcomes from the transfer environment did not significantly differ between groups. However, those students who reported to have applied the strategies from the training intervention actually showed superior learning outcomes. The self-explanation training intervention ""convinced"" just part of the learners to engage in principle-based self-explanations.

The purpose of the current study was to examine whether different category structures may lead to greater or less similarity change. We created six category structures and examined changes in similarity as a result of categorization in between-participant conditions. The best-supported hypothesis was that the ease of learning a categorization affects change in similarity, with the most change following learning of difficult category structures. There was also support for the hypothesis that similarity change is more likely to occur when the category boundary was not aligned with the physical dimension of variation.

2013,Inferring Sensory Experiences,"Several scholars, e.g. Sellars (1956), Meltzoff & Gopnik (1993), have construed the attribution of experiences as being governed by a folk-psychological theory in which experiences function as theoretical entities. However, so far this claim has not been convincingly supported by an account of how people infer the existence of experiences. In this paper I argue that the mechanisms that lead to the stipulation of experiences are fundamentally inferential and are applied in both self-attribution and third-person attribution of experiences. The two most common sources for going through such inferential processes are (i) disagreements between two people in how the world is presented to them, (ii) being aware of or suspecting differences between how the world is presented to a person and extraneous information the person has about the world. From situations like these, I show that ‘experience’ is a theoretically-acquired concept which refers to entities that play an explanatory role in virtue of fulfilling two conditions: a person entertains the concept experience if that person makes an appearance-reality distinction (C1) and considers the appearance to be subjective (C2).",>Kevin Reuter,">Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0234/index.html

In the present study we report on the emergence of gestural communication systems (“homesigns”) invented by deaf individuals in Nicaragua. Analysis of longitudinal data from several families shows gradual convergence toward a gestural system with the essential characteristics of a shared lexicon. We propose a general computational framework to formalize the linguistic and social interactions among the individual signers such that a shared lexicon may arise. More specifically, a reinforcement learning process that adjusts the individual’s probability of gesture use in response to others’ actual gesture use provides a suitable account of the observed gestural convergence.

2013,A Bottom-up approach to the cultural evolution of bilingualism,"The relationship between individual cognition and cultural phenomena at the society level can be transformed by cultural transmission (Kirby, Dowman, & Griffiths, 2007). Top-down models of this process have typically assumed that individuals only adopt a single linguistic trait. Recent extensions include ‘bilingual’ agents, able to adopt multiple linguistic traits (Burkett & Griffiths, 2010). However, bilingualism is more than variation within an individual: it involves the conditional use of variation with different interlocutors. That is, bilingualism is a property of a population that emerges from use. A bottom-up simulation is presented where learners are sensitive to the identity of other speakers. The simulation reveals that dynamic social structures are a key factor for the evolution of bilingualism in a population, a feature that was abstracted away in the top-down models. Top-down and bottom-up approaches may lead to different answers, but can work together to reveal and explore important features of the cultural transmission process.",>Sean Roberts,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0236/index.html
2013,Integration and Inference: Cross-Situational Word Learning Involves More than Simple Co-occurrences,"Statistical word learning involves forming and aggregating associations between words and objects that co-occur across contexts (e.g., Vouloumanos & Werker, 2009; Smith & Yu, 2008; Yu & Smith, 2007). However, the mechanisms that support such learning are currently under debate, including the extent to which learners carry forward multiple ambiguous associations (e.g., Trueswell et al., 2013). The current study presented adults with a set of statistical word learning tasks designed to measure the statistical computations learners employ to build label-object mappings and to probe what information from past contexts is available to further process and integrate with new information. Results reveal that learners use the co-occurrence of label-object pairings to make inferences both about objects and labels currently present and those presented on previous trials. Further, the strength of learners’ memory for past contexts moderated their inferences, suggesting a role for a rich information structure in cross-situational word learning.",>Alexa Romberg>Chen Yu,">Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0237/index.html

We provide a computationally explicit, dynamical model of the process of phonological planning. In this model, the properties of a perceived utterance automatically serve as input to the ongoing planning of an intended utterance. Using tools from non-linear dynamics, we formalize how incoming inputs from perception influence the ongoing choice of phonological parameters to be used in production. Our model provides an account of response time modulations reported in independent experimental work, and makes additional concrete predictions that can be tested experimentally. Our model provides a foundation for better understanding the cognition of speech perception, speech production, and the interaction between the two.",>Kevin D. Roon>Adamantios I.

2013,The spatial representation of grammatical number,"Research on numerical cognition suggests a strong link between mental representations of space and quantity. The SNARC effect (Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes effect) is characterized by the association of small quantities with left space and large quantities with right space. While the majority of research on the spatial representation of number has been on number words or Arabic numerals, this study investigates quantity representations that are involved in the processing of grammatical number. We found that German words that were inflected for singular had a relative left hand advantage, and conversely, plurals had a relative right-hand advantage. However, this pattern was only found in relatively late responses. Moreover, it appeared to interfere with the opposite pattern caused by the MARC effect (Markedness Association of Response Codes effect) leading to a relative right-hand advantage for singulars. This interference appeared to depend mainly on response latency with MARC effects being more pronounced in early responses and SNARC-like effects being more pronounced in late responses. This work sheds light on the interaction of different stimulus-to-response mappings operating on the same stimulus dimension – grammatical number. Moreover, it suggests that spatial numerical associations go beyond explicit numerical information, as in number words or Arabic numerals.",>Timo Röttger>Frank Domahs,">IfL Phonetik, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany>Department of Germanic Linguistics, University of Marburg",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0239/index.html

We presented 70 locomotion videos to Japanese and English speakers and asked them to create a word that would sound-symbolically match each action, then to rate the action on five semantic dimensions. Multivariate analyses revealed that certain sound-meaning links (e.g., voicing and speed) were more consistent than others within and across languages. Language-specific sound symbolism was also found for some sound-meaning links (e.g., the affricate manner of articulation was associated with light motions in Japanese, but with heavy motions in English). This implies that cross-linguistically shared and language-specific parts of sound symbolism are intricately intertwined within each language. This research underscores the importance of a bottom-up approach which can exploratorily investigate the complex sound-symbolic systems as a whole.",>Noburo Saji>Kimi Akita>Mutsumi Imai>Katerina Kantartzis>Sotaro Kita,>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/Keio University>Osaka University>Keio University>University of Birmingham>University of Birmingham,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0240/index.html
2013,Polarity correspondence does not explain the SNARC effect,"Conceptual metaphor congruency effects have been interpreted as evidence for the notion that the representation of abstract conceptual dimensions (e.g., power, evaluation) rests on more concrete dimensions (e.g., space, brightness). However, an alternative account based on the notion of polarity correspondence has recently received empirical support from studies about the mapping between affective evaluation and morality on vertical space. We tested the polarity correspondence account in the domain of number, which shows well-known congruency effects with lateral left-right space (the SNARC effect). Response polarity was manipulated by varying keyboard eccentricity in both parity (odd-even) and quantity (larger-smaller than 5) tasks. Response eccentricity did not modulate the SNARC effect. In a final experiment, the orthogonal Simon effect was modulated by the manipulation of response eccentricity. We conclude that polarity correspondence does not provide an adequate explanation of conceptual congruency effects in the domain of number.",>Julio Santiago>Daniël Lakens,>Universidad de Granada>Eindhoven University of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0241/index.html

Eye-tracked participants described pictures of transitive events. Fixations to the two characters in the events were compared across sentences differing in agreement marking and post-verbal word order. Fixation patterns show evidence for two temporally dissociated phases in Tagalog sentence production. The first, driven by verb agreement, involves early linking of concepts to syntactic functions; the second, driven by word order, involves incremental lexical encoding of these concepts. These results suggest that even the earliest stages of sentence formulation may be guided by a language's grammatical structure.",>Sebastian Sauppe>Elisabeth Norcliffe>Agnieszka E. Konopka>Robert D.

2013,Learning hierarchical categories in deep neural networks,"Psychological experiments have revealed remarkable regularities in the developmental time course of cognition. Infants generally acquire broad categorical distinctions (i.e., plant/animal) before finer ones (i.e., bird/fish), and periods of little change are often punctuated by stage-like transitions. This pattern of progressive differentiation has also been seen in neural network models as they learn from exposure to training data. Our work explains why the networks exhibit these phenomena. We find solutions to the dynamics of error-correcting learning in linear three layer neural networks. These solutions link the statistics of the training set and the dynamics of learning in the network, and characterize formally how learning leads to the emergence of structured representations for arbitrary training environments. We then consider training a neural network on data generated by a hierarchically structured probabilistic generative process. Our results reveal that, for a broad class of such structures, the learning dynamics must exhibit progressive, coarse-to-fine differentiation with stage-like transitions punctuating longer dormant periods.",>Andrew M.

2013,Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling: Does it Improve Parameter Stability?,"Fitting multi-parameter models to the behavior of individual participants is a popular approach in cognitive science to measuring individual differences. This approach assumes that the model parameters capture psychologically meaningful and stable characteristics of a person. If so, the estimated parameters should show, to some extent, stability across time. Recently, it has been proposed that hierarchical procedures might provide more reliable parameter estimates than non-hierarchical procedures. Here, we examine the benefits of hierarchical parameter estimation for assessing parameter stability using Bayesian techniques. Using the transfer-of-attention-exchange model (TAX; Birnbaum & Chavez, 1997), a highly successful account of risky decision making, we compare parameter stability based on hierarchically versus non-hierarchically estimated parameters. Surprisingly, we find that parameter stability for TAX is not improved by using a hierarchical Bayesian as compared to a non-hierarchical Bayesian approach. Further analyses suggest that this is because the shrinkage induced by hierarchical estimation overcorrects for extreme yet reliable parameter values. We suggest that the benefits of hierarchical techniques may be limited to particular conditions, such as sparse data on the individual level or very homogenous samples.",>Benjamin Scheibehenne>Thorsten Pachur,>University of Basel>Max Planck Institute for Human Development,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0244/index.html

In this contribution we present the results of a systematic comparison of 5 model comparison methods. Employing model recovery simulations, the methods are examined with respect to their ability to identify the model that actually generated the data across 3 pairs of models and a number of comparison situations. The simulations reveal several interesting aspects of the considered methods such as, for instance, the fact that in certain situations methods perform worse than model comparison neglecting model complexity.

2013,Rational preference shifts in multi-attribute choice: what is fair?,"Humans exhibit certain systematic context-dependent preference reversals when choosing among options that vary along multiple attribute dimensions. For instance, the attraction, similarity, and compromise effects each involves a change in relative preference between two options when a third option is introduced. Previously, such effects have been attributed to irrationality or sub-optimality in decision-making, or to specific architectural or dynamical constraints on cognition. We use a Bayesian model of multi-attribute choice to demonstrate that these effects naturally arise from three basic assumptions: (1) humans assess options relative to “fair market value” as inferred from prior experience and available options; (2) attributes are imperfectly substitutable, and scarce attributes are relatively more valuable; (3) uncertainty about market conditions and option values contributes to stochasticity in choice behavior. This work provides both a novel normative explanation for contextual modulation of choice behavior, and a means to predict choice as a function of past experiences and novel contexts.",>Pradeep Shenoy>Angela Yu,">Microsoft AdCenter, Bangalore, India>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0248/index.html
2013,Automatic and Instructed Attention in Learned Predictiveness,"In novel situations, learning is biased towards information that has a degree of prior predictive utility. In human learning, this is termed the learned predictiveness effect and has proved critical in theorising about the role of attention in learning. Two experiments are reported in which the relative contribution of controlled and automatic processes to learned predictiveness are investigated. Experiment 1 showed that while learned predictiveness is susceptible to instructional manipulation, this effect is partial. Experiment 2 manipulated predictive utility and instruction orthogonally in order to test the potential involvement of automatic processes. It was found that even when cues were explicitly instructed as causal, learning was biased in favour of previously predictive over previously non-predictive cues. Interestingly, this was reversed for cues instructed as irrelevant. This suggests that learned predictiveness benefits attentional control, whereby information is both easier to attend and ignore.",>Lauren Shone>Evan Livesey,">University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia>University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0249/index.html
2013,Communication Leads to the Emergence of Sub-optimal Category Structures,"Words divide the world into labeled categories. Languages vary in the categories they label, sometimes to the point of making cross-cutting divisions of the same space. Previous work suggests two opposing hypotheses about how communication contributes to category emergence: 1) these spaces lack an objective shared similarity structure, and communication dynamically creates one of a number of optimally shareable category structures; 2) the category structures resulting from communication are not necessarily optimal, but diverge from a shared similarity space in language-specific ways. We had participants categorize images drawn from a continuous space in two conditions: a) non-communicative, by similarity, b) communicative, dynamically creating categories when playing a partnered communication game. The memory demands of communication lead to reliance on salient images and early conventions, resulting in non-optimal category structures compared to non-communicative participants. This supports the hypothesis that communication leads to categories that diverge non-optimally from a shared similarity space.",>Catriona Silvey>Simon Kirby>Kenny Smith,">Language Evolution and Computation Research Unit, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh>Language Evolution and Computation Research Unit, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh>Language Evolution and Computation Research Unit, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0250/index.html

Using a quasi-experimental design we explored how social factors of screen media co-viewing impact children’s learning outcomes. We observed parents co-viewing a novel word training video with their children, then tested children for immediate and delayed word learning. We then investigated the links between parental speech during co-viewing and children’s subsequent word learning. Parental speech that encouraged children to produce the novel words predicted better retention of word learning, whereas speech that focused more on the video itself rather than the content was negatively associated with learning.",>Clare Sims>Eliana Colunga,>University of Colorado Boulder>University of Colorado Boulder,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0252/index.html
2013,Investigating the Other-Race Effect of Germans towards Turks and Arabs using Multinomial Processing Tree Models,"The other-race effect (ORE) refers to the phenomenon that recognition memory for other-race faces is worse than for own-race faces. We investigated whether White Germans exhibited an ORE towards Turkish or Arabic faces using a multinomial processing tree model (MPT), the two-high threshold model of recognition memory with three response categories (old, skip, and new). Using an MPT enabled us to adequately disentangle memory and response processes using the Fisher information approximation, a minimum description length based measure of model complexity. Results showed that participants exhibited an ORE on the memory parameters but not on the parameters representing response processes.",>Henrik Singmann>David Kellen>Karl Christoph Klauer,">Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg, Germany>Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg, Germany>Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0253/index.html
2013,"Semantics: Intuition, Experiment or Illusion?","Externalist theories in natural language semantics have become the orthodoxy since Kripke is widely thought to have refuted descriptive theories involving internal cognitive representation of meaning. This shift may be seen in developments in philosophy of language of the 1970s – the direct reference “revolution against Frege” (Wettstein 2004). Almog (2005) writes of the “uprising against Frege’s doctrines” that “spread like fire” based on the work of Kripke, Donnellan, Putnam and Kaplan. However, I consider Fodor’s (2004) heretical thought that something has gone “awfully wrong” in this philosophical consensus, perhaps confirming Chomsky’s (1992) view that the whole field of philosophical semantics is “utterly wrongheaded” and “crazy” by virtue of its non-naturalist assumptions and “methodological dualism.” I suggest that the externalist orthodoxy is a kind of cognitive illusion seen elsewhere in philosophy and cognitive science.",>Peter Slezak,>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0254/index.html
2013,Physical predictions over time,"In order to interact with the world, people must be able to predict how it will unfold in the future, and these predictions must be updated regularly in light of new information. Here we study how the mind updates these predictions over time. Participants were asked to make ongoing predictions about the destination of a simulated ball moving on a 2D bumper table. We modeled these decisions by assuming people simulate the world forward under uncertainty. This model fit participants’ behavior well overall, suggesting that people continuously update their physical simulations to inform their decisions. In some specific scenarios participants’ behavior is not fit well by the simulation based model in a manner suggesting that in certain cases people may be using qualitative, rather than simulation-based, physical reasoning.",>Kevin A Smith>Eyal Dechter>Joshua B Tenenbaum>Edward Vul,>UC San Diego>MIT>MIT>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0255/index.html
2013,Linguistic structure is an evolutionary trade-off between simplicity and expressivity,"Language exhibits structure: a species-unique system for expressing complex meanings using complex forms. We present a review of modelling and experimental literature on the evolution of structure which suggests that structure is a cultural adaptation in response to pressure for expressivity (arising during communication) and compressibility (arising during learning), and test this hypothesis using a new Bayesian iterated learning model. We conclude that linguistic structure can and should be explained as a consequence of cultural evolution in response to these two pressures.",>Kenny Smith>Monica Tamariz>Simon Kirby,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0256/index.html
2013,Modelling the Supervisory System and Frontal Dysfunction: An Architecturally Grounded Model of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task,"We present a model of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, a classical neuropsychological test frequently used to assess deficits in executive functioning. The model is grounded in a cognitive architecture based on the Supervisory System theory of Norman and Shallice (1986) and evaluated against data from control subjects and several groups of neurological patients as reported by Stuss et al. (2000). The model is able to account for control performance across a range of dependent measures. When damaged in theoretically motivated ways it is also able to capture the behaviour of the different patient groups. Specifically, the model supports the association by Shallice et al. (2008) of the function of task-setting to left lateral prefrontal cortex, of the function of attentiveness to inferior medial prefrontal cortex, and of the function of monitoring to right lateral prefrontal cortex. The implication of these results for the supervisory system architecture and the localisation of function within prefrontal cortex are discussed.",>Mariam Sood>Richard Cooper,">Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0257/index.html

The present paper reports the results of three studies that attempted to replicate the findings of Lev-Ari and Keysar (2010) by focusing on processing fluency manipulations other than accent.

2013,Picture-Word Interference with Masked and Visible Distractors: Different Types of Semantic Relatedness Inhibit Lexical Selection,"One question in word production is how the presence of a semantically related word affects the naming process. It has been suggested that semantic effects in picture-word interference tasks are a net result of both inhibitory and facilitatory processes that take place at different processing levels. Finkbeiner and Caramazza (2006) argued that masking distractor words removes the inhibitory component, leaving only lexical facilitation. We investigated this claim by comparing different types of semantic relationship – categorical relatedness, associative relatedness, and a combination of both – in picture-word interference with masked and visible distractors. We observed inhibitory effects in all conditions. In the visible condition, semantic category coordinates exerted the strongest inhibition, while in the masked condition, associatively related distractors interfered most. These findings are not easily reconciled with previous findings on polarity shifts of semantic effects with masked distractors. We discuss how all present findings could be explained within the same framework.",>Katharina Spalek>Markus Damian,">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany>University of Bristol, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0259/index.html
2013,Implications of Polychronous Neuronal Groups for the Nature of Mental Representations,"How are concepts represented in the human mind? Vector space representations based on the instantaneous firing rates of neurons have been used with great success. However, there is growing evidence, both empirical and computational, that relevant information is encoded in spatiotemporal patterns of spikes called polychronous neuronal groups (PNGs). In this paper, we consider the philosophical implications of PNG representations with regard to their temporal extension, grounding, compositionality, and similarity. We suggest that the temporally extended nature of PNGs implies that conceptual-level dynamics may only be coherent at coarse time scales. We introduce the notion of PNG trigger sets as a way to ground the meaning of PNG representations, and we discuss potential approachs to compositionality. Finally, we identify the open problem of how to define an appropriate similarity metric for PNG-based mental representations.",>William Benjamin St. Clair>David C.

This data set allows us to connect full details of training history with measures of performance, for participants who are engaged for a sustained amount of time in effortful practice. We show that lawful relations exist between practice amount and subsequent performance, and between practice spacing and subsequent performance. This confirms results long established in the literature on skill acquisition. Additionally, we show that higher initial variation in performance is linked to subsequent higher performance, a result we link to the exploration-exploitation trade-off from the computational framework of reinforcement learning. We discuss the benefits and opportunities of behavioural datasets with very large sample sizes and suggest that this approach could be particularly fecund for studies of skill acquisition.",>Tom Stafford>Michael Dewar,>University of Sheffield>New York Times,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0261/index.html
2013,When seeing isn't believing: Influences of prior conceptions and misconceptions,"Instruction often employs visual representations to support deep understanding. However, students’ prior misconceptions may override the meaning in these scaffolds. We investigate fraction bars, a common representation intended to promote sense-making. Our prior work found that students often did not use the fraction bars effectively. This difficulty factors assessment compares four scaffold types: pictures only, two forms of pictures with numbers, and numbers only, to assess which interpretation steps were difficult. On equivalence items, students performed equally well with all scaffolds that included pictures, but worse with the numbers-only scaffold, indicating that fraction bars improved scores for equivalence. However, including numbers with the pictures decreased performance for fraction addition. Although students demonstrated competence with fraction bars in fraction equivalence, they did not transfer this knowledge to addition. These results suggest caution in designing and teaching representations for sense-making.",>Eliane Stampfer>Kenneth Koedinger,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0262/index.html

As syntax is a major component of semantic analysis, we explore how a long-term and institutional bias towards the verb as the main determiner of syntactic (and semantic) structure may underserve some kinds of information. We introduce an analysis paradigm that restores the noun to some importance in syntactic analysis.

2013,"Working Memory, Cognitive Miserliness and Logic as Predictors of Performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test","The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) was devised to measure the inhibition of heuristic responses to favour analytic ones. Toplak, West and Stanovich (2011) demonstrated that the CRT was a powerful predictor of heuristics and biases task performance - proposing it as a metric of the cognitive miserliness central to dual process theories of thinking. This thesis was examined using reasoning response-times, normative responses from two reasoning tasks and working memory capacity (WMC) to predict individual differences in performance on the CRT. These data offered limited support for the view of miserliness as the primary factor in the CRT. The strongest predictor of CRT in both experiments was WMC. It is argued that while cognitive miserliness has been implicated in CRT performance, participants must also possess the requisite WMC and mindware to successfully complete it. Therefore, the psychological and psychometric properties of the CRT require continued study.",>Edward Stupple>Maggie Gale>Christopher Richmond,>University of Derby>University of Derby>University of Derby,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0264/index.html
2013,Syllable Frequency and Stress Priming Interact in Reading Italian Aloud,"In current theories of word reading the structure and operations of the phonological buffer are quite underspecified. We investigated this issue by running a reading aloud experiment in Italian. We adopted a priming paradigm, with three-syllabic words as primes and targets and we jointly manipulated two effects ascribed to the stage of phonological and phonetic encoding, that is stress priming and syllable frequency. Target words varying for the frequency of their initial syllable were preceded by words congruent or incongruent for the stress pattern. The results showed an interaction between syllable frequency and stress prime, with the stress congruency effect larger for the targets with low-frequency first syllable. This result suggests that, in reading aloud, stress assignment and syllable computation have a tight time dynamics in the phonological output buffer, and that the process at the level of phonology-to-phonetic interface operates interactively.",>Simone Sulpizio>Remo Job,>University of Trento>University of Trento,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0265/index.html
2013,How Does Prospect Theory Reflect Heuristics’ Probability Sensitivity in Risky Choice?,"Two prominent approaches to describing how people make decisions between risky options are algebraic models and heuristics. The two approaches are based on fundamentally different algorithms and are thus usually treated as antithetical, suggesting that they may be incommensurable. Using cumulative prospect theory (CPT; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) as an illustrative case of an algebraic model, we demonstrate how algebraic models and heuristics can mutually inform each other. Specifically, we highlight that CPT describes decisions in terms of psychophysical characteristics, such as diminishing sensitivity to probabilities, and we show that this holds even when the underlying process is heuristic in nature. Our results suggest that algebraic models and heuristics might offer complementary rather than rival modeling frameworks and highlight the potential role of heuristic principles in information processing for prominent descriptive constructs in risky choice.",>Renata Suter>Thorsten Pachur>Ralph Hertwig,">Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition>Max Planck Institute for Human Development",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0266/index.html

Participants indicated the Scope (the degree of set inclusion) of semantic generalizations about real categories in a Pretest. In subsequent experiments, these Scope values were used to predict the willingness of participants to retain statements in their existing knowledge sets. When those sets were logically compatible with a Modus Tollens (MT) structure, participants were more likely to retain the general statements, but not when the sets were logically compatible with a Modus Ponens (MP) structure. However, the MP retention rates increased when locatives were added to the generalizations. These findings are inconsistent with several prevailing proposals of belief revision but do support the concept of belief revision as following Possible Worlds logic.",>Alexander Swan>Alexandra Chambers>Russell Revlin,">Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara>Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara>Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0267/index.html

However, it is unclear whether infants are sensitive to the reliability of individual attentional cues. In this eye-tracking study, 8-month-olds were familiarized with a reliable face, which always looked to a box where an animation appeared, and an unreliable face, which looked only 25% of the time to the box containing the animation. At test, when the animations did not appear, infants searched longer in the corner cued by the reliable face, but did not search longer in the corner cued by the unreliable face. These results suggest that even young infants can track the the reliability of potential informants and use this information to distribute attention in support of early learning.",>Kristen Swan Tummeltshammer>Rachel Wu>Natasha Z.

We show that the cognitive complexity of game trials, measured with respect to reaction time, can be predicted by looking at the structural properties of the game instances. In order to do this, we define complexity measures of finite dynamic two-player games based on the number of alternations between the game players and on the pay-off structure. Our predictions of reaction times and reasoning strategies, based on the theoretical analysis of complexity of Marble Drop game instances, are compared to subjects' actual reaction times. This research illustrates how formal methods of logic and computer science can be used to identify the inherent complexity of cognitive tasks.

The most recently used (MRU) algorithm, known to be one of the simplest adaptive algorithms, and probabilistic MRU algorithm were used to test the human capability to understand an algorithm. The experimental results showed that inductive reasoning in which participants observed the history of computer action, and they updated a statistical model while restricting their focus on a certain history with deteministic bias and Markov bias played key role to correctly understand the MRU algorithm. The results also showed that deductive reasoning was used to understand algorithms when participants rely on prior knowledge, and that there was a case in which the algorithm, even known to be the simplest one, was never understood.",>Kazunori Terada>Seiji Yamada>Akira Ito,>Gifu University>NII>Gifu University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0271/index.html

2013,Is Lexical Access Driven by Temporal Order or Perceptual Salience? Evidence from British Sign Language,"While processing spoken language, people look towards relevant objects, and the time course of their gaze(s) can inform us about online language processing (Tanenhaus et al, 1995). Here, we investigate lexical recognition in British Sign Language (BSL) using a visual world paradigm, the first such study using a signed language. Comprehension of spoken words and signs could be driven by temporal constraints regardless of modality (“first in, first processed”), or by perceptual salience which differs for speech (auditorialy perceived) and sign (visually perceived). Deaf BSL signers looked more often to semantically related distracter pictures than to unrelated pictures, replicating studies using acoustically-presented speech. For phonologically related pictures, gaze increased only for those sharing visually salient phonological features (i.e., location and movement features). Results are discussed in the context of language processing in different modalities. Overall, we conclude that lexical processing for both speech and sign is likely driven by perceptual salience and that potential differences in processing emerge from differences between visual and auditory systems.",>Robin L.

The concept of pet fish illustrates the difficulty. Most people expect pet fish to live in bowls, even though this is not something either pets or fish normally do. The inference that pet fish have the feature of living in bowls cannot be explained purely in terms of the constituents themselves. The feature seems to emerge. The present paper aims to explain this effect using notions of classificatory composition. Adjoined concept references are taken to construct classifications rather than combinations; a pet fish is taken to be a fish classified as a pet rather than a combination of a pet a fish. It is also shown that, where concepts have a compositional representation, feature emergence can be accounted for in terms of compositional accommodation.",>Chris Thornton,>University of Sussex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0274/index.html

And how are such proto-meanings acquired in development? Here we present three experiments, and assess children’s early understanding of seven time words: second, minute, hour, day, week, month, and year. Our findings indicate that children first learn time words as a lexical class, then learn their ordinal relations, but initially have little to no knowledge of their relative durations. This understanding emerges late in development – many years after children first start using time words in speech – and in many children does not emerge until they have acquired formal definitions for the words.",>Katharine Tillman>David Barner,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0275/index.html

Labeled categories are learned faster, and are subsequently more robust. The present study extends this research paradigm by considering the relationship between verbal labels and flexible categorization. Flexibility is a key trait of human cognition, and flexible categorization is important in a number of tasks. Participants learned to categorize ‘friendly’ and ‘unfriendly’ aliens either with or without names, followed by a transfer task. While selective attention to a particular dimension slowed relearning, no effect of label was found for either category learning or relearning with one exception; labels facilitated flexibility when selective attention was not involved in the transfer. The inability to replicate effects of verbal labels in category learning using similar methodologies raises interesting theoretical issues, questioning the extent to which this relationship applies.",>Jackson Tolins>Eliana Colunga,">Dept. of Psych., UC, Santa Cruz>Dept. of Psych., CU, Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0276/index.html

In Experiment 1 we show that trials which examine sensitivity to sample size in inductive reasoning have greater effects on secondary task performance than do trials examining sensitivity to the diversity of the sample. In Experiment 2 we show that in a surprise recognition memory test, participants have significantly better memory for the content of diversity trials than for sample size trials.

In Experiment 1, participants generated persuasive arguments for a target analog under three experimental conditions: without indication to use analogies, with instruction to use analogies, and with indication to search for sources within four predefined domains. Responses from the first condition showed that argumentation rarely triggers spontaneous analogical retrievals. Results from the remaining conditions demonstrated that the superficial bias can be strategically reversed when participants are suggested to focus on specific domains. Experiment 2 replicated this last result with the simple instruction to search within domains different from that of the target (i.e., without being provided with a list of specific domains).

However, extensive research has shown that decision-making and behavior result from the interaction of two separate systems of reasoning - one that is fast, automatic, and experiential and one that is slow, deliberative and rational. This paper develops the first dynamic dual-process model of decision-making that can account for choice, response times, and prices. The model is applied to several phenomena from the risky decision-making literature including enhancements in preference by small losses, preference reversals due to response mode, and the influence of price and affect on preference.",>Jennifer Trueblood,">University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0279/index.html
2013,Expert marker of Chinese character recognition: Left-side bias versus holistic processing?,"Holistic processing and left-side bias are both behavioral markers of expert face recognition. In contrast, Chinese character recognition expertise involves left-side bias but reduced holistic processing (Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009). Here we examine whether the reduction in holistic processing associated with expert Chinese character recognition can be better explained by writing rather than reading experience. Compared with non-Chinese readers (novices), Chinese readers who had limited writing experience (Limited-writers) showed increased holistic processing, whereas Chinese readers who could also write characters fluently (Writers) showed reduced holistic processing. This result suggests that writing/sensorimotor experience can modulate holistic processing effects, and that the reduced holistic processing observed in expert Chinese readers may depend on writing rather than reading experience. By contrast, both Writers and Limited-writers showed a similar level of left-side bias in processing symmetric Chinese characters, left-side bias may therefore be a consistent expertise marker for object recognition uninfluenced by motor experience.",>Ricky Van-yip Tso>Terry Kit-fong Au>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao,">Center for Advancement of Chinese Language Education and Research, University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0280/index.html
2013,A distributional learning account of the acquisition of the locative alternation: Corpus analysis and modeling,"Early in acquisition children overgeneralize verbs to ungrammatical structures. The retreat from overgeneralization is linked to the acquisition of verb classes, the semantics of which constrain the structures in which a verb can appear (e.g., Pinker 1989; Ambridge, Pine & Rowland, 2012). How children learn these classes remains unclear. Some argue that distributional regularities in linguistic input provide sufficient evidence for verb classes to emerge and become linked to particular structures. A corpus analysis of the English locative construction (e.g., the woman sprayed water onto the wall/the wall with water) demonstrated that children have similar verb classes to adults. A correspondence analysis revealed that distributional regularities in the input could support these verb classes. Finally, a connectionist simulation was able to model early overgeneralization and retreat through distributional learning of verb classes.

The role of interactivity in problem solving was investigated using a river-crossing problem. All participants performed the task twice, once in a high interactivity condition and once in a low interactivity condition. Moves to completion were higher in the high interactivity condition but latency per move was much shorter with high than with low interactivity. Moves in the world were easier to implement than to simulate mentally and acted as epistemic actions to facilitate thinking. In addition, when participants experienced the low interactivity version of the task second, their performance reflected little learning. However, when the high interactivity version was completed second, latency to solution and latency per move were substantially reduced. These results underscore the importance of investigating problem solving behaviour from a distributed cognition perspective.",>Frédéric Vallée-Tourangeau>Lisa Guthrie>Gaëlle Villejoubert,>Kingston University>Kingston University>Kingston University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0282/index.html

The choices individuals make often deviate from the rational or mathematically objective solution. Accordingly, the dynamics of human decision-making are difficult to capture using conventional, linear mathematical models. Here, we present data from a two-choice task with variable risk between sure loss and risky loss to illustrate how a simple nonlinear dynamical system can be employed to capture the dynamics of human decision-making under uncertainty (i.e., multi-stability, bifurcations). We test the feasibility of this model quantitatively and demonstrate how the model can account for up to 86% of the observed choice behavior. The implications of using dynamical models for explaining the nonlinear complexities of human decision-making are discussed, as well as the degree to which nonlinear dynamical systems theory might offer an alternative framework for understanding human decision-making processes.",>Marieke van Rooij>Luis Favela>MaryLauren Malone>Michael Richardson,">University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0283/index.html

Using a video-based paradigm, 40-month-old children observed six types of behaviors (i.e. yawning, laughing, frowning, cheek-scratching, mouth-rubbing and head-wiggling) performed by a model which they had previously seen either helping or hindering another model. Results indicate that children carried out five of the six behaviors more often while watching the behavior videos than during baseline. However, no differences were found between the two social manipulations. We conclude that young children demonstrate mimicry like that reported in adults and discuss the possible causes of the absence of a social effect.",>Johanna E. van Schaik>Rick van Baaren>Harold Bekkering>Sabine Hunnius,">Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen>Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University, Nijmegen>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0284/index.html
2013,Joint Action Coordination through Strategic Reduction of Variability,"How do people coordinate actions with others? We tested the hypothesis that pairs of participants strategically reduce the variability of their action performance to achieve synchronicity in the absence of visual feedback about each other’s actions. Consistent with this prediction, participants moved faster and less variably in a condition where they could not see their task partner’s movements compared to a condition in which visual information was available. The accuracy of the resulting coordination was the same in both conditions. These findings are interpreted as evidence for general strategic adaptation in the service of real-time action coordination when only minimal perceptual information is available.",>Cordula Vesper>Laura Schmitz>Natalie Sebanz>Günther Knoblich,">Department of Cognitive Science, Central European University>Department of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück>Department of Cognitive Science, Central European University>Department of Cognitive Science, Central European University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0285/index.html

Showing motion displays upside-down or with changes in global structure is known to disturb processing in different ways, but not much is known yet about how inversion affects attention and incidental processing. To examine the perception of upright and inverted point-light walkers regarding incidental processing, we used a flanker paradigm (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974) adapted for biological motion (Thornton & Vuong, 2004), and extended it to include inverted and scrambled figures. Results show that inverted walkers do not evoke incidental processing and they allow high accuracy in performance only when attentional capacities are not diminished. An asymmetrical interaction between upright and inverted figures is found which alludes to qualitatively different pathways of processing.",>Peter Veto>Serge Thill>Paul Hemeren,">University of Verona, Verona, Verona, Italy>University of Skovde, Skovde, Sweden>University of Skovde, Skovde, Sweden",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0286/index.html
2013,The Role of Circadian Variations and Socially Distributed Thinking in Belief Perseverance,"From the moment they make up their mind, people are reluctant to change it. We tested the hypothesis that people disposing of more cognitive resources—through circadian variations or socially distributed thinking—would engage in deliberative thinking and would consequently be less likely to exhibit belief perseverance. Perseverance was measured by the change in judgments related to a suspect in a criminal case, following the presentation of an offender profile that was at odds with the suspect’s description. Individuals tested at a compatible circadian time exhibited less perseverance in the face of contradictory evidence compared to individuals tested at an incongruent time. Individuals deliberating on their own also tended to show more belief perseverance compared to those who worked in groups. There was, however, no interaction effect between circadian timing and condition of deliberation on belief change. The implications for our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin belief perseverance are discussed.",>Gaëlle Villejoubert>Madiha Khan>Frédéric Vallée-Tourangeau,>Kingston University London>Kingston University London>Kingston University London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0287/index.html

Here we use a large sample of lexical decision data (British Lexicon Project, Keuleers et al., 2012) and we carry out a series of analyses differing in the way emotional variables are treated. A variety of statistical approaches yielded common conclusions: when confounding variables are taken into account, emotional words, whether positive or negative, are processed faster than neutral words. This effect is categorical rather than graded; is not modulated by emotional arousal; and is not limited to words explicitly referring to emotions. We discuss this in terms of internally grounding words’ meanings in emotional experience, akin to the manner in which concepts may be grounded in perception and action.",>David Vinson>Marta Ponari>Gabriella Vigliocco,>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0288/index.html
2013,Does the Influence of Stress on Financial Risk Taking Depend on the Riskiness of the Decision?,"Many decisions under risk and uncertainty are made under physical or emotional stress. Recent research suggests that stress influences decisions between risky options, but that the direction of the influence depends on the characteristics of the gambles. For instance, stress increases risk taking for loss gambles, but decreases risk taking for gain gambles. In the current project we investigate: (1) whether the riskiness of gambles influences the direction of the stress effect and (2) whether changes in risk taking can be linked to changes in attention. Participants who gave relatively more attention to gains than to losses, as indicated by eye- tracking data, were more risk seeking than participants who gave less attention to gains. Stress did not influence participants’ attention. However, stressed participants became more risk seeking when considering gambles with relatively low risk, but less risk seeking for gambles with relatively high risk.",>Bettina von Helversen>Jörg Rieskamp,>University of Basel>University of Basel,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0289/index.html
2013,"Negative observations, induction and the generation of hypotheses","In category-based induction tasks, it is a robust finding that positive observations raise the judged likelihood of a conclusion and negative observations lower judged likelihood. We present evidence that negative observations can raise the judged likelihood. In particular, we asked participants to judge the likelihood of a conclusion after introducing them to different sets of premises either containing one positive observation or the same positive observation and a negative observation. We found that when the negative observation is dissimilar to the positive observation, willingness to accept a conclusion is raised. Moreover, results from a simultaneous hypothesis generation task suggest that the rise in judged conclusion likelihood is due to a peculiar shift in the hypothesis space of the reasoner, in that the hypothesis with the largest extension, yet still consistent with all premises gains disproportionate popularity when introducing dissimilar negative observations.",>Wouter Voorspoels>Chayenne Van Meel>Gert Storms,">University of Leuven, Belgium>University of Leuven, Belgium>University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0290/index.html

In Experiment 1, preschoolers prompted to explain during a causal learning task were more likely to override a tendency to generalize according to perceptual similarity and instead extend an internal feature to an object that shared a causal property. In Experiment 2, we replicated this effect of explanation in a case of label extension. Experiment 3 demonstrated that explanation improves memory for internal features and labels, but impairs memory for superficial features.

In two experiments, we examined 18-24-month-old infants’ relational inferences using a causal version of a relational match-to-sample task. Results suggest that by 21-24 months of age, infants are able to infer a relational causal principle from just a few observations and use this inference to guide their own subsequent actions and bring about a novel causal outcome.

2013,Programming of saccades to double-step targets in scene viewing: A test of assumptions present in the CRISP model,"Several computational models explaining fixation durations in scene viewing (Nuthmann, Smith, Engbert, & Henderson, 2010) and in reading (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998) assume that saccade programming is completed in two stages: an initial, labile stage that is subject to cancellation and an subsequent, non-labile stage in which the program can no longer be cancelled. This distinction is motivated by findings from double-step experiments that used much simpler situations than scene viewing or reading. Here, we adopt a classic double-step paradigm to a scene-viewing context. In a Static condition targets are presented to the left or right of a central fixation cross along a horizontal axis while in a Scene condition targets are presented in a gaze contingent manner along a trajectory defined by the location of recent fixations. We found evidence in support of the claims that saccade cancellation occurs within a naturalistic scene-viewing context and that saccade cancellation can account for increases in observed fixation duration distributions. The duration of the non-labile stage was estimated to be longer in the Scene condition compared to the Static condition.",>R.

2013,New Empirical Tests of a Quantum Model for Question Order Effects,"Recent findings show that human inferences and decisions interfere in ways analogous to incompatible quantum observables, and conceptual judgments are inseparable in ways similar to entangled quantum states. This discovery has led a group of physicists and psychologists to form a new field called “quantum cognition,” which uses mathematical principles of quantum theory to explain human cognitive behavior. The power of this new theoretical approach is illustrated here by testing an a priori and precise prediction derived from quantum theory regarding question order effects commonly observed in survey research. The test of quantum theory was statistically satisfied across a set of 26 national surveys on presidential job approval and country satisfaction in past 10 years. These results suggest that quantum theory, initially invented to explain order effects on measurements in physics, provides a powerful prediction for measurement order effects in social and behavioral sciences too.",>Zheng Wang>Tyler Solloway>Jerome Busemeyer,">The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, U.S.>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, U.S.>Indiana University, Bloomington, U.S.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0294/index.html

2013,The Cognitive Reflection Test: how much more than Numerical Ability?,"Frederick’s (2005) Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is a 3-item task shown to predict susceptibility to decision-making biases better than intelligence measures. It is described as measuring ‘cognitive reflection’ - a metacognitive trait capturing the degree to which people prefer to reflect on answers rather than giving intuitive responses. Herein, we ask how much of the CRT’s success can be explained by assuming it is a test of numerical (rather than general) intelligence. Our results show CRT is closely related to numerical ability and that its predictive power is limited to biases with a numerical basis. Although it may also capture some aspect of a rational cognition decision style, it is unrelated to a metacognitive, error-checking and inhibition measure. We conclude that the predictive power of the CRT can, largely, be explained via numerical ability without the need to posit a separate ‘cognitive reflection’ trait.",>Matthew Welsh>Nicholas Burns>Paul Delfabbro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0296/index.html

Sensitivity to statistical dependency in social learning,"Social learning has been shown to be an evolutionarily adaptive strategy, but can be implemented via many different cognitive mechanisms. Sensitivity to statistical dependency in the behavior of other people is a factor that discriminates between possible mechanisms: blind imitation or simple rule based strategies may be unaffected by dependency, while more sophisticated social learning strategies should take it into account. We use a Bayesian model to determine how rational agents should incorporate the effects of statistical dependency when learning from other people, conducting two experiments that examine whether human learners behave similarly. We find that people are sensitive to two different patterns of dependency, supporting the use of a sophisticated strategy for social learning.",>Andrew Whalen>Daphna Buchsbaum>Thomas Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0297/index.html

Thus, in resolving psychological uncertainty, the act of making a judgment itself appears to have a constructive role in subsequent related decisions. This study focuses on emotional ambivalence and the development of affective evaluations over two stages, such that (just) making an intermediate evaluation in the first stage is shown to influence the overall affective evaluation in the second stage. Models based on classical probability theory, which assume that an intermediate evaluation simply reads off an existing internal state, cannot accommodate this result in a natural way. An explanation is offered with a quantum probability model, which, under specific circumstances, requires the measurement of an internal state to have a constructive role.

2013,"Learning nonadjacent dependencies in thought, language, and action: Not so hard after all.","Learning to represent hierarchical structure and its nonadjacent dependencies (NDs) is thought to be difficult. I present three simulations of ND learning using a simple recurrent network (SRN). In Simulation 1, I show that the model can learn distance-invariant representations of nonadjacent dependencies. In Simulation 2, I show that purely localist SRNs can learn abstract rule-like relationships. In Simulation 3, I show that SRNs exhibit facilitated learning when there are correlated perceptual and semantic cues to the structure (just as people do). Together, these simulations show that (contrary to previous claims) SRNs are capable of learning abstract and rule-like nonadjacent dependencies, and show critical perceptual- and semantics-syntax interactions during learning. The studies refute the claim that neural networks and other associative models are fundamentally incapable of representing hierarchical structure, and show how recurrent networks can provide insight about principles underlying human learning and the representation of hierarchical structure.",>Jon Willits,>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0299/index.html

Here, we ask if this learning ability is restricted to language. Specifically, we ask if phrase structure can be induced from non-linguistic visual arrays and further, whether learning is assisted by abstract category information. In an artificial visual grammar paradigm where co-occurrence relationships exist between categories of objects rather than individual items, participants preferred phrase-relevant pairs over frequency-matched non-phrase pairs. Additionally, participants generalized phrasal relationships to novel pairs, but only in the cued condition. Taken together these results show that learners can acquire phrase structure in a non-linguistic system, and that cues improve learning.",>Sarah Wilson>Carla Hudson Kam,>Georgia Institute of Technology>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0300/index.html
2013,The Role of Scene Gist and Spatial Dependency among Objects in the Semantic Guidance of Attention,"A previous study (Hwang et al., 2011) found evidence for semantic guidance of visual attention during the inspection of real-world scenes, i.e., an influence of semantic relationships among scene objects on overt shifts of attention. In particular, the results revealed an observer bias toward gaze transitions between semantically similar objects. However, these results are not necessarily indicative of semantic processing of individual objects but may be confounded by knowledge of the scene gist, which does not require object recognition (Torralba et al., 2006), or by known spatial dependency among objects (Oliva & Torralba, 2007). To examine the mechanisms underlying semantic guidance, in the present study, subjects were asked to view a series of displays with the scene gist removed and spatial dependency varied. Our results confirm the previous finding of semantic guidance and show that it is not entirely due to either the effect of scene gist or the spatial dependency among objects. Even without scene gist or spatial dependency, subjects still retrieved semantic information to guide their attention. This strategy may facilitate scene understanding and object memorization.",>Chia-Chien Wu>Hsueh-Cheng Wang>Marc Pomplun,">Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston>Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston>Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0301/index.html

We studied how people evaluate predictions with binary outcomes. These predictions can be conveyed in two equivalent ways: one predicting an outcome with some probability, and the other predicting the other outcome with the probability of the complement of the first outcome. Although these two ways of stating the predictions are mathematically interchangeable, we hypothesized that people would judge the congruently stated prediction, one that has the same qualitative component as the actual outcome, as more accurate. We tested this hypothesis in four experiments. Results suggested that this effect is consistent across a number of domains; depends on the frame in which the prediction is stated; is robust regardless of whether the ratings were elicited in positive or negative terms; holds for both rating and choice tasks.",>Saiwing Yeung,>Beijing Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0302/index.html

2013,An Embodied Perspective of Early Language Exposure,"Advances in developmental research has made it clear that word learning has a long beginning. Recent work has demonstrated that infants learn words at 6 months of age—that is, before the traditional “first word” milestone in productive language—which is a full year before the usual “naming explosion” in productive vocabulary. Before infants talk, walk, or even point, how can the earliest stage of word learning take place at all? We used recent technology that allowed us to zoom in on the point of view of infants and also the traditional roomview observations to document how infants’ visual input is dynamically synchronized with their own participation, as well as from social input in the context of parent-child word learning play. The parents’ task was to play with the child with a set of toys as they taught the toys to them. To specifically document the child’s dominant view and their participation, we coded the size of the toy object on which the child was focused and who was manipulating the toy at the moment. The results reveal systematic and dynamic links between infants’ view and their level of participation.",>Hanako Yoshida>Joseph M.

To benefit from a naming event, children must at least hear the label and see the referent. We tested 1-, 2- , 3-, and 4-year old children in a naturalistic word learning task with two conditions: one that taxed both speech processing and rapid gaze-following, and one in which a social cue-to-reference was available for an extended time. The development of word-learning in the extended condition paralleled the development of speech processing, but learning in the brief condition lagged behind. However, learning from both the brief and extended cues was predicted by individual differences in speech processing and cue-following together. Thus, even through the 4th year, real-time processing of social and linguistic information are a critical bottleneck for word learning.",>Daniel Yurovsky>Anna Wade>Michael Frank,">Stanford University>University of California, San Francisco>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0305/index.html
2013,Cheap but Clever: Human Active Learning in a Bandit Setting,"How people achieve long-term goals in an imperfectly known environment, via repeated tries and noisy outcomes, is an important problem in cognitive science. There are two interrelated questions: how humans represent information, both what has been learned and what can still be learned, and how they choose actions, in particular how they negotiate the tension between exploration and exploitation. In this work, we examine human behavioral data in a multi-armed bandit setting, in which the subject choose one of four “arms” to pull on each trial and receives a binary outcome (win/lose). We implement both the Bayes optimal policy, which maximizes the expected cumulative reward in this ﬁnite horizon bandit environment, as well as a variety of heuristic policies that vary in their complexity of information representation and decision policy. We ﬁnd that the knowledge gradient algorithm, which combines exact Bayesian learning with a decision policy that maximizes a combination of immediate reward gain and long-term knowledge gain, captures subjects’ trial-by-trial choice best among all the models considered; it also provides the best approximation to the computationally intense optimal policy among all the heuristic policies.",>Shunan Zhang>Angela Yu,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0306/index.html
2013,Knowledge tracing and cue contrast: Second language English grammar instruction,"This paper introduces a cognitive tutor designed for second language grammar instruction. The tutor adopted Corbett and Anderson’s (1995) Bayesian knowledge tracing model and provided adaptive training on the English article system. We followed the Competition Model (MacWhinney, 1997) and understood the article system as a galaxy of cues determining article usage on the basis of form-function mapping. Cues are in competition during language acquisition; hence cue contrast is predicted to be an effective instructional method. Seventy-eight students were randomly assigned to four article training conditions (to learn 33 cues) and a control condition (to write essays). We found that article-training groups significantly outperformed the control group in an immediate posttest and a delayed posttest. Specifically, our result also suggested that there was a significant interaction between cue contrast and cue type (definite vs. indefinite). Cue contrast promoted more learning on the indefinite cues (more difficult for learners). Knowledge tracing did not demonstrate such an interactional effect with cue types. Instead, it boosted the instructional effect promoted by cue contrast.",>Helen Zhao>Kenneth Koedinger>John Kowalski,>The Chinese University of Hong Kong>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0307/index.html

Here we investigated the effect on interference of isolated practice in color naming (of incongruent and neutral stimuli) and in word reading (of color names) in adults and children in Grades 4–5. In both groups interference was reduced after practicing color naming of incongruent stimuli. For children, interference was also reduced after practice in word reading of color names. In neither group was interference diminished after practice in color naming of neutral stimuli.

In the first experiment, participants were instructed to perform either vertical or horizontal head movements while viewing a slideshow of 76 randomized positive and negative images, which they later had to recognize from a set containing 50% of the same target images and 50% distractor images. No interaction between head movement type and image valence was obtained. In the second experiment, participants were told to remember as many images as possible from a slideshow of 60 randomized valenced images, which they were later asked to freely recall.

The empiricist view assumes that language acquisition is the product of abstractions from empirical input but leaves it as an open question whether sequential or hierarchical structure is needed.

2013,Whorf for the 21st century: From interactive processing to linguistic relativity,"The crux of the Whorfian thesis is that our thought and behavior are influenced in deep ways by the language we use. In recent years we have seen a wave of rigorous and creative investigations of this thesis (Boroditsky, 2010; Wolff & Holmes, 2011 for reviews). Yet, many researchers remain highly skeptical of findings purporting to support Whorfian claims (Gleitman & Papafragou, 2005), and much confusion remains about how to integrate these find-ings into existing theories of cognition. A major barrier to understanding the degree to which various aspects of human cognition may be affected by speaking different languages is understanding the relationship between language—any language—and the rest of cognition. To remove this barrier we need to address a fundamental question: To what degree is normal human cognition actually language-augmented cognition? I will argue that a surprising variety of behavior previously assumed to be “nonverbal” shows signs of being influenced by linguistic factors and I will outline a theory of language-augmented thought that offers a mechanistic account of where we might expect to find effects of language on “nonverbal” cognition (Lupyan, 2012a, 2012b, for reviews).",>Gary Lupyan,">University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0312/index.html

Simulation occurs when neural activity in modal association cortex triggers time-locked, recurrent and feedback activity across multiple lower-level modal processing areas from which the memory was initially constructed. Through this distributed multi-regional activity, seeing an object or reading its name (e.g., “dog”) re-enacts associated features that were stored during earlier learning experiences (e.g. its shape, color, motion, actions with it), thereby constructing cognition, memory, and meaning. This paper reviews convergent evidence from cognitive neuroscience of mental imagery, object cognition, and memory that supports a multi-state interactive (MUSI) account of automatic and strategic mental simulation mechanisms that can ground memory, including the meaning, of objects in modal processing of visual features.",>Haline E.

2013,Approximating Bayesian inference with a sparse distributed memory system,"Probabilistic models of cognition have enjoyed recent success in explaining how people make inductive inferences. Yet, the difficult computations over structured representations that are often required by these models seem incompatible with the continuous and distributed nature of human minds. To reconcile this issue, and to understand the implications of constraints on probabilistic models, we take the approach of formalizing the mechanisms by which cognitive and neural processes could approximate Bayesian inference. Specifically, we show that an associative memory system using sparse, distributed representations can be reinterpreted as an importance sampler, a Monte Carlo method of approximating Bayesian inference. This capacity is illustrated through two case studies: a simple letter reconstruction task, and the classic problem of property induction. Broadly, our work demonstrates that probabilistic models can be implemented in a practical, distributed manner, and helps bridge the gap between algorithmic- and computational-level models of cognition.",>Joshua Abbott>Jessica Hamrick>Thomas Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0316/index.html
2013,The Effect of Physical Load in Cognitive Process of Estimation,"The purpose of this study was to examine the process of embodied cognition in distance estimation. According to recent cognitive science studies, our intelligent behavior that ranges from perception to inference is not accomplished in only a closed mental process, but is affected by body and action. However, previous studies do not clarify whether these effects were derived from physical load or subjective heaviness. In order to examine the question, two experiments were conducted using the “size-weight illusion’’. Performance on the distance estimation task was not affected by subjective heaviness but by physical load.",>Keiga Abe,>Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0317/index.html
2013,Automatic Labeling of Phonesthemic Senses,"This study attempts to advance corpus-based exploration of sound iconicity, i.e. the existence of a non-arbitrary relationship between forms and meanings in language. We examine a number of phonesthemes, phonetic groupings proposed to be meaningful in the literature, with the aim of developing ways to validate their existence and their semantic content. Our first experiment is a replication of Otis and Sagi (2008), who showed that sets of words containing phonesthemes are more semantically related to each other than sets of random words. We augment their results using the British National Corpus and the Semantic Vectors package for building a distributional semantic model. Our second experiment shows how the semantic content of at least some phonesthemes can be identified automatically using WordNet, thereby further reducing the room for intuitive judgments in this controversial field.",>Ekaterina Abramova>Raquel Fernández>Federico Sangati,">Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands>University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0318/index.html
2013,Can Playing Portal Affect Spatial Thinking and Increase Learning in a STEM Area?,"Spatial skills have been associated with learning in STEM areas and some research has shown that playing video games could facilitate the development of spatial skills. This study examines whether playing a game that uses a realistic physics engine and places spatial demands on the players could facilitate learning a subsequent physics lesson. Fifty-eight participants viewed a brief lesson on Newton’s laws of motion after either playing the puzzle game Tetris or the first-person perspective puzzle game Portal, which incorporates aspects of physics such as momentum. The groups did not differ on subsequent tests of learning outcomes involving physics, but the Portal group scored significantly higher on a perspective taking test (d = 0.57). This study shows that playing a commercial game that incorporates Newtonian physics does not prepare students to learn physics but does improve an important spatial cognition skill related to physics.",>Deanne Adams>Richard Mayer,">University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0319/index.html
2013,Dancing With Myself: The effect of majority group size on perceptions of majority and minority robot group members,"While social psychology has identified characteristics of intergroup dynamics, few studies have looked into the perceptions of robot group dynamics. In this experiment, we separate robots into majority and minority groups based solely on their behavior in a simple dance routine. We attempt to understand how people's perceptions of robots within those groups change based on group size and features of behavior. Participants viewed the robot dances and rated one robot from each group on a variety of characteristics. We find that being from the minority versus majority group has a significant impact on perceptions of a robot's creativity, interestingness, anti-sociality, dancing ability, and how much of a team player it is. At the same time, individual behaviors (leading the dance, following the dance, or performing an entirely unique dance) have no statistical effect on participants' ratings of robot characteristics. From these results, we conclude that group size has a larger effect than behavior on subjective evaluations of robots in majority and minority groups.",>Henny Admoni>Bradley Hayes>David Feil-Seifer>Daniel Ullman>Brian Scassellati,>Yale University>Yale University>Yale University>Yale University>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0320/index.html
2013,Gesture and Language Production in Communication through Bar Graphs,"Bar graphs and line graphs are commonly used ways of graphical communication. Due to the difference in their perceptual visuo-spatial properties, they facilitate comprehension of different events. Bar graphs are commonly used in the domain of precipitation although the data intrinsically carry information that is averaged over long time spans. In this study, we investigate how the presence of incongruence between consecutive graph pairs influences conceptualization of the represented information about precipitation. For this, we analyzed gestures and verbal descriptions produced by the participants as indicators of event conceptualizations. The results of the experimental investigation reveals that when incongruent graph pairs are presented, the participants show tendency to produce directional gestures that accompany the verbal descriptions of the specific regions represented by one/two bars. Additionally, the presence of incongruence seems to enhance the production of comparative words accompanied with non-directional gestures.",>Ozge Alacam>Christopher Habel>Cengiz Acartürk,">University of Hamburg, Germany>University of Hamburg, Germany>Middle East Technical University, Turkey",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0321/index.html

Participants studied three-variable line graphs while (a) concurrently thinking aloud or (b) silently studied the graphs and provided an interpretation once they felt they had understood it. Results showed that verbalisation hindered performance significantly compared to the silent condition. To support the claim that the act of verbalising was hindering performance, competing explanations were also tested, which confirmed thinking aloud as the most likely cause. This contradicts claims by Ericsson and Simon (1993) that thinking aloud reflects but does not affect performance and provides further evidence that verbalising thought processes can hinder performance.",>Nadia Ali>David Peebles,>University of Huddersfield>University of Huddersfield,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0322/index.html
2013,A Question of Timing: The Impact of Label Synchrony on Infants' Categorisation,"Recent research into the impact of labelling on infants’ visual category formation has led to controversial results, with some findings indicating a beneficial role and others pointing to interference effects in the presence of labels. Here we present an eye tracking study with 12-month-olds investigating the impact of the label’s timing on categorisation. We find that synchronous presentation of words and objects leads to a decreased novelty preference, creating the impression of a dramatic detrimental impact on learning. Asynchronous presentation of the word one second after the image onset does not appear to interfere with processing. Detailed analyses of infants' gaze patterns with respect to object parts reveal that even synchronous labels do not hinder learning but slow down infants' shift from familiarity to novelty preference. Besides offering detailed insight into the effects of labelling on infants' attention our findings offer the potential to reconcile previous contradictory results.",>Nadja Althaus>Kim Plunkett,">University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom>University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0323/index.html
2013,Shape categorization in Autism: Does it follow the pattern of typical development?,"When identifying basic-level categories (e.g., airplane, cow), typically developing (TD) children commonly use the overall shape of objects as basis for their judgments. This so-called shape bias is tied to the size of a child’s vocabulary and as such might be a way of adaptively organizing an ever-growing vocabulary. The current study looks at whether the same is true for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A group of participants with ASD and TD controls were asked to categorize objects that differed in the amount of item detail. Results show that vocabulary size was related to success in categorizing objects for TD participants, but not for ASD participants. We discuss the degree to which a link between shape bias and vocabulary size in ASD children may be an indication of differentiated patterns of adaptation.",>Joseph Amaral>Susan Collins>Shannon O'Connor>Shealan McAlister>Heidi Kloos>Carol Luzzi,>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>Memorial Hospital of South Bend,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0324/index.html
2013,Gender and Sex: The Experiential Basis of Grammar,There have been contradictory reports of sex differences in language processing. A novel approach is adopted here which explores the experiential basis of such differences. Two studies examine the auditory processing of grammatical gender in Bulgarian in a gender decision (gender monitoring) task and a cued shadowing (word repetition) task. Reaction times in both experiments reveal significant two-way interactions between the grammatical gender of words (masculine vs. feminine) and the sex of the voice (male vs. female). The sex of participants in the gender decision task also interacted with word gender in terms of decision accuracy. Women were relatively more accurate on their “own reference” word gender (feminine) and less accurate on masculine gender words. A two-way interaction between word gender and participant sex on response latencies in the cued shadowing task supports the view that these effects are not strategic but have a highly automatic nature instead. Findings are interpreted in terms of individual differences in the experience of grammatical gender in such gender-marking languages.,>Elena Andonova,>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0325/index.html
2013,Why and How to Measure the Association between Choice Options,"Prominent theories of decision making, such as {\it proportional difference model}, {\it priority heuristics}, {\it decision field theory} and {\it regret theory} assume that people do not evaluate options independently of each other. Instead, these theories predict that people compare the options' outcomes with each other. Therefore the theories' predictions strongly depend on the association between outcomes. In the present work, we examine how the association between options can be best described. For options with two outcomes the standard correlation measure between option's outcomes does not provide a meaningful interpretation. Therefore, we propose the standardized covariance between options A and B, denoted as $\sigma^*_{AB}$. We describe the properties and interpretation of this measurement and show its similarities and differences with the correlation measurement. Finally, we show how the predictions of different models of decision making vary depending on the value of the standardized covariance.",>Sandra Andraszewicz>Jörg Rieskamp,">University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland>University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0326/index.html

We refer to this as the Hidden Stochastic Automaton. This model, while based on a generalization of the Hidden Markov model, has qualitatively greater generative power than either the Hidden Markov model itself or any of its existing variants and generalizations. This allows the Hidden Stochastic Automaton to be used as a probabilistic model of natural languages in a way that is not possible with existing dynamical Bayesian networks. Its relevance to Cognitive Science is primarily as a computational --- in the Marr (1982) sense of the term --- model of cognition, but potentially also as a model of resource bounded cognitive processing, and as a model of the implementation of computation in physical dynamical systems.",>Mark Andrews,>Nottingham Trent University and University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0327/index.html

Moving from the identification of the psychological traits that uniquely define each reaction, two concurrent hypotheses are suggested and discussed: either the richness of human social life requests a variety of reactions, or the benefits of single reactions at the psychological level allowed these reactions to be maintained in the social life.",>Giulia Andrighetto>Francesca Giardini>Rosaria Conte,>ISTC-CNR; EUI>ISTC-CNR>ISTC-CNR,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0328/index.html

Additionally, it has been shown that when a linguistic task (metaphor explanation) involves the right brain hemisphere, the left hand becomes more gesturally active. We hypothesized that gestures with a particular hand activate cognitive processes in the contra-lateral hemisphere. We examined whether gestures with the left hand enhance metaphoricity in verbal responses. Results showed participants produced more metaphoric explanations when instructed to produce gestures with their left hand as compared to the right hand or not gesture at all. In addition, we measured the mouth asymmetry during metaphorical speech to determine individual differences in right-hemisphere involvement in metaphor processing. The left-side mouth dominance, indicating stronger right-hemisphere involvement, positively correlated with the left-hand-over-right-hand advantage in gestural facilitation of metaphorical speech. We concluded that left-hand gestures enhance metaphorical thinking in the right hemisphere.",>Paraskevi Argyriou>Sotaro Kita,">University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK>University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0329/index.html

Not much has been said about reasoning. One promising avenue to explore here is the theory of bounded rationality (BR). In this paper, we try to clarify the potential relationship between these two programs. We start by discussing Andy Clark’s interpretation of BR, which we find unconvincing in several respects. Next, we take a closer look at CE in order defend a version of it that stands against mainstream internalism without committing itself to constitutional claims about the mind. We then turn to analyze BR from the CE perspective. Finally, we argue that internalism about cognition cannot explain important aspects of the BR program.",>Eric Arnau>Saray Ayala>Thomas Sturm,">Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain>Universidad Carlos III de Madrid>Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0330/index.html

It is suggested that the field could gain from studying how different instructional principles interact when they are combined. The goal of this research was to systematically study the combined effects of collaborative learning and hypothesis testing on cognitive growth. In a randomized experiment, 496 9th graders solved challenging tasks that required fully developed proportional reasoning. Half of them were given the opportunity to test their solutions. Based on individual pretests, each student was assigned to one of three competency levels (low, medium, high), and randomly assigned to either work alone or with a (low, medium, high) peer.

Expert structural geologists were asked to explain one portion of a geologic map. Spatial gestures used in each expert’s response were coded as deictic (indicating an object in the conversational space), iconic (depicting an aspect of an object or event), or both deictic and iconic (indicating an object in the conversational space by depicting an aspect of that object). Speech paired with each gesture was coded for whether or not it referred to complex spatial properties (e.g. shape and orientation of an object). Results indicated that when communicating spatial information, people occasionally use gestures that are both deictic and iconic, and that these gestures tend to occur when complex spatial information is not provided in speech. These results suggest that existing classifications of gesture are not exclusive, especially for spatial discourse.",>Kinnari Atit>Ilyse Resnick>Thomas Shipley>Carol Ormand>Cathryn Manduca>Tilbe Goksun>Basil Tikoff,">Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States>Temple University>Temple University>Carleton College>Carleton College>University of Pennsylvania>University of Wisconsin Madison",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0333/index.html

Here we explore whether lowering the attentional demands during the initial fast mapping task facilitates word learning. Three-year-old children completed fast mapping and test trials using a touch screen computer. For half of the children, the non-targets (competitors) repeated across trials and for other children there was no repetition. All children received the same word learning test trials. Only children who had received repeating competitors (lower attentional demands) during the initial fast mapping task demonstrated word learning. Thus, these data suggest that children’s ability to learn novel names is strongly influenced by the competition and attentional demands of the initial fast mapping context.",>Emma Axelsson>Jessica Horst,>University of New South Wales>University of Sussex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0334/index.html
2013,"On The Possibility of an Extended, Yet Reductionist Mind","In the debate around the extended mind, the special alliance that the extended thesis often has with functionalism usually plays in favor of the former, with functionalism providing support for the extended thesis. Here I want to consider this alliance in the opposite direction: does the extended thesis provide support for functionalism by promoting the need of a level of explanation that is independent of implementational (in particular neural) details? In spite of a seemingly promising line of reasoning for an affirmative answer, I show here that a commitment to the extended thesis or any version of externalism neither paves the way for a functionalist (or any other anti-reductionist) position nor is incompatible with an explanatory reductionism about the mind. I arrive to that conclusion after analyzing an argument by van Eck et al.

This model is used to simulate the categorical choices of participants in two experiments of Desain and Honing (2003). The model is able to accurately replicate the experimental data.

2013,Measuring Cultural Relativity of Emotional Valence and Arousal using Semantic Clustering and Twitter,"Researchers since at least Darwin have debated whether and to what extent emotions are universal or culture-dependent. However, previous studies have primarily focused on facial expressions and on a limited set of emotions. Given that emotions have a substantial impact on human lives, evidence for cultural emotional relativity might be derived by applying distributional semantics techniques to a text corpus of self-reported behaviour. Here, we explore this idea by measuring the valence and arousal of the twelve most popular emotion keywords expressed on the micro-blogging site Twitter. We do this in three geographical regions: Europe, Asia and North America. We demonstrate that in our sample, the valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords differ significantly with respect to these geographical regions --- Europeans are, or at least present themselves as more positive and aroused, North Americans are more negative and Asians appear to be more positive but less aroused when compared to global valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords.

Importantly, unlike the psycholinguistic experiments that focus on the learning of an artificial novel construction using novel verbs, here we examine the acquisition of the English sentential complement construction from naturalistic input.

In a series of simulations a group of agents made repeated choices between options. We varied the building blocks of the strategies used by agents, the structure of the social network and characteristics of the task environment. A key factor influencing strategies’ success is the speed with which they are able to respond to environmental change. In general, imitate-the-best provides a faster response compared to imitate-the-majority and larger samples help the former but hurt the latter. Less efficient networks decrease the performance of both, but are more detrimental for imitate-the-majority.

2013,Spoken Words Activate Cross-Linguistic Orthographic Competitors in the Absence of Phonological Overlap,"Related languages, like English and Spanish, often have similar orthographies but use the same letters for different sounds. Learning a second language frequently involves learning additional letter-sound mappings that mismatch native language mappings. In the current study, we investigated whether L2 spoken words activate L2 orthography despite conflict with L1 orthography-to-phonology mappings. Participants first learned an artificial language with letter-sound mappings that mismatched English (e.g., the letter 'G' represented /h/, and the word /gufo/ was spelled 'hane'). Next, fixations of L1 orthographic competitors (e.g., 'cane') in response to auditory L2 input (e.g., /gufo/) were assessed using the visual world paradigm. Results showed that participants fixated L1 competitors that overlapped with targets orthographically (but not phonologically) more than unrelated fillers. We conclude that second language learners can rapidly acquire novel letter-sound mappings, and words based on these mappings are integrated into the existing lexicon, activating orthographic competitors in the native language.",>James Bartolotti>Natalia Daniel>Viorica Marian,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0340/index.html

We will show that the model defined by Corley and Crocker can account for a considerable amount of variance in reading times of naturally occurring texts.

In two eye-tracking experiments, we investigated tense-response compatibility effects. In our first experiment (E1, where sentence tense was relevant to the task) we found compatibility effects at the beginning of the sentence (e.g., Yesterday versus Tomorrow), which shifted to interference effects by sentence end. Overall, we also found compatibility effects in response times, replicating Ulrich and Maienborn. Both compatibility effects in Experiment 1 (E1) were stronger for low- compared to high-WM readers. In Experiment 2 (E2, where tense was irrelevant), we found compatibility effects for high-WM readers, but only in early reading measures.

2013,Visual Support for Instructional Analogy: Context Matters,"Instructional analogies can overload children’s executive function and working memory resources (see Richland, Morrison & Holyoak, 2006), though structure-mapping lies at the core of recommended pedagogy in mathematics instruction (National Mathematics Panel, 2008; NRC, 2001). Videotaped mathematics instruction was manipulated to test the role of visual representations in instructional analogy. Pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest measures assessed 11- 13 year old children’s learning from one of three versions of the same lesson in which three solution strategies (one a misconception) were compared. Analogs were either a) Not Visible (NV) - presented only orally, b) Partially Visible (PV) – only the most recent solution was visible, or 3) All Visible (AV) - all solutions were visible throughout the instruction. Overall, AV students experienced greater learning gains in procedural knowledge, procedural flexibility, and conceptual/ schematic knowledge compared to PV students. These results persist after one-week delay. Apart from procedural knowledge, the same trend is evident when comparing AV students’ to NV students’ immediate learning gains. Overall, visual representations of analogs within an instructional analogy appear to support schema formation only when they are all visible simultaneously and throughout structuremapping. Showing students visual representations of analogs but not enabling them to be simultaneously visible led to the lowest performance overall, suggesting this may lead to more object-level encoding than schema formation.",>Kreshnik Begolli>Richland Lindsey,">University of California, Irvine>University of Chicago",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0346/index.html

We discuss three such theories and evaluate them with reference to new data on object naming elicited through a confederate priming paradigm. Our results show that participants adopt primed referring expressions if they are highly involved in the task, but mere exposure to the object labels yields very limited priming effects. Also, common ground is a relatively marginal factor in expression choice here. We interpret these results as supportive of the importance of grounding and challenging for interactive alignment-based accounts of expression choice.",>Marieke Behnel>Chris Cummins>Lorenz Sichelschmidt>Jan De Ruiter,>Universität Bielefeld>Universität Bielefeld>Universität Bielefeld>Universität Bielefeld,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0347/index.html
2013,Gaze strategies in object identification and manipulation,"Task influence has long been known to play a major role in the way our eyes scan a scene. Interestingly, how the task modulates attention when interacting with objects has been less investigated. Only few studies have contrasted the distribution of eye fixations during viewing and grasping objects. How is at- tention differently deployed when different actions have to be planned on objects in contrast to a purely perceptual viewing condition? To investigate these issues, we conducted an eye- tracking experiment showing participants 2D images of real- world objects. In blocks of trials, participants were asked either to assign the displayed objects to one of two classes (classification task), to mimic lifting the object (lifting task), or to mimic opening the object (opening task). Mean fixation locations and attention heatmaps show different modes in gaze distribution around task-relevant locations, in accordance with previous literature. Reaction times, measured by button release in the manual response, suggest that the more demanding the task in terms of motor planning the longer the latency in movement initiation. Results show that even on simplified, two dimensional displays the eyes reveal the current intentions of the participants. Moreover, the results suggest elaborate cognitive processes at work and confirm anticipatory behavioral control. We conclude with suggesting that the strongly predictive information contained in eye movements data may be used for advanced, highly intuitive, user-friendly brain-computer interfaces.",>Anna Belardinelli>Martin V.

2013,The Role of Achievement Goal Motivation in Self-Explanation and Knowledge Transfer,"Self-explanation is an important constructive cognitive process that helps students learn in such a way that they can flexibly transfer their knowledge to solve novel problems (Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reimann, & Glaser, 1989). However, research has not addressed what leads students to spontaneously self-explain, in the absence of prompting. The present study experimentally manipulates student motivation (in terms of achievement goals) and measures what influence this has on self-explanation and transfer. Participants (N = 140) received goal framings that reflected either a mastery-approach goal (striving to develop one’s understanding), a performance-approach goal (an aim to outperform others), a performance-avoidance goal (avoid doing worse than others) or a no-goal control. This framing was applied to a set of learning and test tasks on basic statistics, which participants completed while thinking aloud. Results showed a benefit for a performance-avoidance condition in terms of both higher levels of self-explanation and transfer. This unexpected result is discussed in terms of theories of motivation and learning, and their potential impact on educational practice.",>Daniel Belenky>Timothy Nokes-Malach,>Carnegie Mellon University>University of Pittsburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0349/index.html

Participants had to use their mouse to draw graphical representations (termed squig- gles in the game) of human faces in order to communicate with fellow players. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of varying features of the input images on the resulting drawings. Ex- periment 2 introduced varying comprehension conditions that were predicted to produce differences in how features of faces would be graphically represented. In experiment 1, the fea- tures of the different faces significantly shaped the structure of the resulting squiggles.

Anchors determine the starting state of this network. As the network settles, we show that the nodes representing numerical responses activate and deactivate consecutively, generating sequential adjustment. By demonstrating that anchoring as adjustment emerges naturally from the dynamics of the biased activation process, we are able to unify the two main theories of the anchoring effect, and subsequently provide a parsimonious explanation for a large range of findings regarding anchoring, and its determinants. Although we focus largely on phenomena related to anchoring, the results of this paper apply equivalently to all judgments under the influence of bidirectional processing, including those involving constraint satisfaction.",>Sudeep Bhatia>Shereen Chaudhry,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0352/index.html
2013,A Neurally Plausible Encoding of Word Order Information into a Semantic Vector Space,"Distributed models of lexical semantics increasingly incorporate information about word order. One influential method for encoding this information into high-dimensional spaces uses convolution to bind together vectors to form representations of numerous n-grams that a target word is a part of. The computational complexity of this method has led to the development of an alternative that uses random permutation to perform order-sensitive vector combinations. We describe a simplified form of order encoding with convolution that yields comparable performance to earlier models, and we discuss considerations of neural implementation that favor the use of the proposed encoding. We conclude that this new encoding method is a more neurally plausible alternative than its predecessors.",>Peter Blouw>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo (UW),https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0353/index.html

The hypothesis was tested in two domains, a mechanical system and a chemical system, and the results were analyzed separately to compare low and high spatial ability learners. The production of visual explanations of a mechanical system, a bicycle tire pump, increased understanding of the pump particularly for participants with low spatial ability. In the domain of chemical bonding, visual explanations were more effective than verbal explanations for all participants. Visual explanations often included crucial yet invisible features; their accurate construction requires and provides a check for completeness of explanations.",>Eliza Bobek,>The Packer Collegiate Institute,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0354/index.html
2013,Do You Mean What You Say? The Effect of Uncertainty Avoidance on the Interpretation of Probability Expressions - A Comparative Study between Spanish and German,"In times of globalization, differences between cultures and in the interpretation of linguistic terms can lead to misunderstanding in communication. The present study focuses on the influence of cultural dimensions, especially uncertainty avoidance, on the interpretation of verbal probability expressions. It is hypothesized that uncertainty avoidance has an effect on the interpretation of uncertainty expressions. Therefore, Spanish and German participants were asked (1) for uncertainty avoidance and (2) to estimate numerical equivalents for 12 verbal probability expressions (e.g., possible). The estimation data were modeled using fuzzy membership functions. Results neither show differences in uncertainty avoidance nor in the interpretation of the probability expressions between these two languages.

2013,Why 100 Once Is Worse Than 10 Times 10: Dread Risks versus “Continuous” Risks,"People tend to react more strongly to a dread risk, a rare event that kills many people at once, than to a continuous risk, a relatively frequent event that kills many people over a longer period of time, even when both cause the same number of fatalities. This different reaction to the dread risk is often considered a bias, but we show that it is an ecologically rational strategy. In a series of simulations, we found evidence that dread risks affect the population more severely over time than continuous risks causing the same number of fatalities. This holds particularly true when the risks affect children and young adults who would have produced future offspring if they had survived longer.",>Nicolai Bodemer>Azzurra Ruggeri>Mirta Galesic,">Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0356/index.html

The present study investigates consequences of this fact for the relative utility of graphs and tables for interpreting data. Participants judged presence or absence of various statistical effects in simulated datasets presented in various formats. For the statistical effects introduced earlier in the study, performance was better with graphs than with tables, while for the effect introduced last in the study, this trend reversed. Additionally, in the later sections of the study, responses with graphs, but not tables, reflected increasing influence from the presence of stimulus features which had been relevant earlier in the study, but were no longer relevant. The findings suggest that graphs, relative to tables, may better facilitate perception of complex relationships among data points, but may also bias readers more strongly to favor some perspectives over others when interpreting data.",>David W.

2013,Entrainment on the Move and in the Lab: The Walking Around Corpus,"We examined lexical choice and variability in referring expressions during direction-giving to pedestrians. A stationary partner (the Giver) directed a mobile partner by telephone (the Follower) to walk about 1.8 miles, to 18 destinations on a medium-sized campus. Followers returned to the lab and partners were tested individually on their spatial ability and memory for the destinations; then they participated in 6 rounds of a referential communication task to repeatedly match duplicate copies of pictures of the destinations. Results include significant rates of lexical entrainment and evidence for partner-specific conceptual pacts. Joint navigation efficiency was affected by direction-givers’ (but not followers’) spatial ability. The Walking Around Corpus, an experimentally parameterized collection of spontaneous spoken dialogues produced by 36 pairs of people communicating by mobile telephone, provides a testbed for lexical entrainment “in the wild” as well as a resource for pedestrian navigation applications; it is available to the research community.",>Susan Brennan>Katharina Schuhmann>Karla Batres,>Stony Brook University>Stony Brook University>Stony Brook University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0358/index.html

2013,Plausibility and Visualizability in Relational Belief Revision,"Belief revision is required when new facts are incompatible with existing beliefs. In the present experiment, participants changed their mind about the spatial and non-spatial relations between objects. The participants received information about relations, which were subsequently contradicted by irrefutable counterfacts. The task was to decide which of the initial relations to retain and which ones to give up. Previous experiments showed that these decisions are guided by the linguistic asymmetry between located (LO) and reference objects (RO). Reasoners have a strong preference to relocate the LO of the counterfactual relation. Our experiment explores whether this robust effect can be overwritten by the plausibility of revised beliefs; and how visualizability of problems affects revision. We found the LO-preference to be robust even when the resulting representation is implausible; and that revision is impeded when problems are easy to visualize. The results shed new light on relational belief revision in humans.",>Leandra Bucher>Jelica Nejasmic>Sabine Bertleff>Markus Knauff,">Justus Liebig University Giessen, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University Giessen, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University Giessen, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University Giessen, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0360/index.html

Only when participants were made aware of the possible relationship between the background cues and target features were they able to utilize the cue information for search. When participants were not made aware of the possible connection, they were only able to use target base rates.

2013,Emotional Priming of Sentence Comprehension: Effects of a Speaker’s Static Emotional Expression and Listener Age,"We report two visual-world eye-tracking experiments that investigated how and with which time course emotional information from a speaker’s face affects younger (N = 32, Mean age = 23) and older (N = 32, Mean age = 64) listeners’ visual attention and language comprehension as they processed emotional sentences in a visual context. The age manipulation was aimed at testing predictions by socioemotional selectivity theory of a positivity effect in older adults. After viewing the emotional face of a speaker (happy or sad) on a computer display, participants were presented simultaneously with two pictures depicting opposite-valence events (positive and negative; IAPS database) while they listened to a sentence referring to one of the events. Participants’ eye fixations on the pictures while processing the sentence were enhanced when the speaker’s face was emotionally congruent with the sentence/picture compared to when it was not. The enhancement occurred from the early stages of sentence-reference disambiguation; importantly, it was modulated by age, in that for the older adults it was more pronounced with positive faces, and for the younger ones with negative faces. These findings demonstrate for the first time that emotional facial expressions, similarly to previously studied speaker cues such as eye gaze and gestures, are rapidly integrated into sentence processing. They also provide new evidence for positivity effects in older adults in online incremental situated sentence processing.",>Maria Nella Carminati>Pia Knoeferle,">University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, NRW, Germany>University of Bielefeld, NRW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0365/index.html

However, it has been shown that either presenting two examples of the relation or adding a label to a single presentation can improve children’s performance. The role of labels has been seen as increasing the likelihood of comparing the instances available. In this paper, we present sustained attention as an alternative to this view. Children completed a relational match-to-sample task in different conditions while an eyetracker registered their eye movements. When only one instance was available, children benefited from the addition of a label. This benefit was associated with an overall decrease in switching behavior, indicating greater sustained attention. Moreover, in the absence of a label, children who showed greater sustained attention were able to achieve good performance by the end of the task.",>Paulo Carvalho>Catarina Vales>Caitlin Fausey>Linda Smith,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0367/index.html
2013,Investing Amid Uncertainty: A Test of the Domain Specific Anchoring Hypothesis,"The current study examined reactions to the precision of earnings’ forecasts in hypothetical investment decisions. In a forced choice task, participants were found to be indifferent between point (e.g., $2) or range (e.g., $1.70-$2.30) forecast formats when both outcomes were favorable (i.e., above market expectation). When the outcomes were unfavorable (below expectation), participants’ preferences were significantly biased towards range estimates. When faced with options which mixed forecast formats and favorability, participants almost always opted for forecasts with a favorable outlook regardless of format. These results are inconsistent with domain specific ambiguity reactions found previously (Du, 2009) and also offer no support for the domain specific anchoring hypothesis (e.g. Du, 2009; Du & Budescu, 2005). These findings raise some doubts about the generality of domain specific reactions to uncertainty and suggest that such effects might be dependent, in part, on the (financial) sophistication of participants.",>Hui Yih Chai>Ben Newell,">University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia>University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0368/index.html

In this experiment, we focused on gestures produced without accompanying speech. Adult participants were asked to study spatial sequence of routes shown in four diagrams, one at a time. Participants rehearsed the routes with gestures, actual hand movements (actually drew the routes on papers), or mental simulation. They then were asked to reconstruct the routes with sticks. Participants who moved their hands (either in the form of gestures or actual drawing) recalled better than those who mentally simulated the routes and those who did not rehearse, suggesting that hand movements produced during rehearsal facilitate encoding of spatial relation. Interestingly, participants who gestured the routes in the air recalled better than those who drew them on papers, suggesting that gesture, as a kind of representational action, exerts more powerful influence on spatial relation encoding.",>Amy Chong>Ben Choi>Elena Kwong>Jennifer Chan>Irina Chong>Mavis Ip>Christopher Yeung>Wing Chee So,>The Chinese University of Hong Kong>The Chinese University of Hong Kong>The Chinese University of Hong Kong>The Chinese University of Hong Kong>The Chinese University of Hong Kong>The Chinese University of Hong Kong>The Chinese University of Hong Kong>The Chinese University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0369/index.html
2013,Aspectual Coercion in Non-native Speakers of English,"This study examined the processing correlates of aspectual coercion among native and non-native speakers of English. For native English speakers, results suggested that the processing delay associated with aspectual coercion is minimal. Aspectual coercion was perhaps cognitively easy to perform. By contrast, non-native speakers of English from unlike first language (L1) backgrounds differed in their reading performance. The differences varied systematically as a function of aspectual contrasts in L1 after controlling for second language (L2) English proficiency. Korean participants showed trends of aspectual coercion despite the absence of significant effects; German participants exhibited indifference across experimental conditions; Chinese participants showed aspectual coercion effects opposite to the predictions specified by the English grammar. A coupling of these data with evidence from the semelfactive progressive (e.g. coughing) in English suggests that the socalled online aspectual coercion effects may arise from a prototype organization of aspectual categories that is prone to L1 influence.",>Ho Leung Chan,>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0370/index.html
2013,"Space, agency and word order: Evidence from Greek","We examined the role of spatial representations and word order on thematic role assignment in Greek. Previous studies suggest that spatial representations influence thematic role assignment; agent is typically depicted on the left, and patient on the right. Here, we address this issue using a language with flexible word order which allows us to manipulate sentence structure (SVO–OVS) orthogonally to thematic role. Greek speakers heard SVO/OVS sentences while viewing depictions of actions involving two characters and they judged whether sentence and picture matched in meaning. The agent’s position in the picture was directly manipulated. The results support the effect of left bias on language processing. However, this bias may be better understood when its interaction with other sources of information and language-specific constraints are taken into account. Theories of prediction may help us illuminate how spatial biases and linguistic factors interactively affect the way we process our world.",>Spyridoula Cheimariou>Sonia Loui,>University of Iowa>University of Athens,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0371/index.html
2013,Whether Chinese Speakers Think about Time More Vertically Depends on their Immediate and Lifetime Experience of Reading Horizontal or Vertical Texts: Evidence from Contextual Priming,"Do Chinese and English speakers think about time differently? Inconsistent findings have been reported even when the same paradigms were used. One of the factors that might have contributed to the inconsistency is participants’ reading experience of horizontal and vertical texts. The present study manipulated this factor experimentally by randomly assigning Chinese participants from Taiwan and China to a reading task involving horizontally or vertically arranged texts. A temporal judgment task (spatial-temporal association of response codes or STARC) followed the reading task immediately. It asked the participants to judge if the event depicted in a second picture occurred earlier or later than that depicted in the first. Responses were faster when the left keys represented the ‘earlier’ responses than when the right keys did (a STARC effect). Half of the participants responded with a horizontally oriented keypad while the rest with a vertically oriented keypad. For the Taiwan participants, the STARC effect was greater when the response keys were oriented vertically than horizontally, but no difference was observed for the China participants. The results also showed that both immediate and lifetime reading experiences modulated the vertical bias. For the Taiwan participants, the vertical bias was strong following the vertical prime, but it disappeared following the horizontal prime. For the China participants, the horizontal prime led to a nonsignificant vertical bias whereas the vertical prime brought about a significant horizontal bias. A questionnaire administered upon completion of the STARC task indicates that the two groups of participants had similar lifetime experience of reading horizontal texts, but the Taiwan participants read vertical texts in their life far more frequently than the China participants. We conclude that the directionality of orthography and speakers’ (immediate and lifetime) reading experience can better explain the vertical bias (or the lack of it) in the Chinese speakers.",>Jenn-Yeu Chen>Michael Friederich>Hua Shu,>National Taiwan Normal University>National Taiwan Normal University>Beijing Normal University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0372/index.html
2013,Hemispheric Asymmetry in Nonconscious Processing,"Here we investigated whether hemispheric asymmetry effects can be observed in nonconscious processing with a basic-level animal categorization (cat/dog) task. We found a significant nonconscious congruency priming effect when the prime was presented in the right visual field/left hemisphere but not when it was presented in the left visual field/right hemisphere when the prime duration was only 10 ms; the left-lateralized congruency priming effect was consistent with the left hemisphere superiority in processing abstract category information reported in the literature (e.g., Marsolek, 1999). This result thus showed that nonconscious processing can go beyond the sensory level to influence hemispheric asymmetry in the processing of category information. In contrast, this hemispheric difference was not observed when the prime was presented for 50 ms (nonconscious) or 150 ms (conscious). This effect may be because 10 ms subliminal information was insufficient to allow inter-hemispheric transfer/processing, allowing the hemispheric difference to emerge. It also suggests that hemispheric asymmetry may be better observed at subliminal level.",>Jing Chen>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao,">Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0373/index.html
2013,Generative Inferences Based on a Discriminative Bayesian Model of Relation Learning,"Bayesian Analogy with Relational Transformations (BART) is a discriminative model that can learn comparative relations from non-relational inputs (Lu, Chen & Holyoak, 2012). Here we show that BART can be extended to solve inference problems that require generation (rather than classification) of relation instances. BART can use its generative capacity to perform hypothetical reasoning, enabling it to make quasi-deductive transitive inferences (e.g., “If A is larger than B, and B is larger than C, is A larger than C?”). The extended model can also generate human-like instantiations of a learned relation (e.g., answering the question, “What is an animal that is smaller than a dog?”). These modeling results suggest that discriminative models, which take a primarily bottom-up approach to relation learning, are potentially capable of using their learned representations to make generative inferences.",>Dawn Chen>Hongjing Lu>Keith Holyoak,">Department of Psychology, UCLA>Departments of Psychology and Statistics, UCLA>Department of Psychology, UCLA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0374/index.html
2013,Logical Consistency and Objectivity in Causal Learning,"Logical consistency and objectivity are cornerstones of science that distinguish it from cult and dogma. Scientists’ concern with objectivity has led to the dominance of associative statistics, which define the basic concept of independence on observations. The same concern with avoiding subjective beliefs has led many scientific journals to favor frequentist over Bayesian statistics. Our analysis here reveals that to infer causes of a binary outcome, (1) the associative definition of independence results in a logical inconsistency -- even for data from an ideal experiment -- for both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, and (2) removing the logical error requires defining independence on counterfactual causal events. The logically coherent causal definition is the one intuitively adopted by humans. Our findings have direct implications for more consistent and generalizable causal discoveries in medicine and other sciences.",>Patricia Cheng>Mimi Liljeholm>Catherine Sandhofer,>UCLA>Cal Tech>UCLA,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0375/index.html
2013,Inferring One’s Own Prosociality Through Choice: Giving Preschoolers Costly Prosocial Choices Increases Subsequent Sharing Behavior,"Prosociality emerges early in ontogeny, but the mechanisms driving its early-emergence are not well understood. We propose that the experience of choice is tied to the expression of children’s prosocial behavior. In Experiment 1, preschoolers shared with a puppet by either making a Costly Choice (giving a resource they could have kept for themselves), Non-Costly Choice (giving a resource that would otherwise be thrown away), or No Choice. Subsequent prosociality was measured by allowing children to share with a new puppet. While most children shared initially, children who were given costly choices shared more with the new puppet. Experiment 2 replicated this result using a different manipulation for Costly vs. Non-Costly choices. Experiment 3 found that preschoolers were more likely to infer that actions are intentional when they are costly. Results suggest a prosocial construal hypothesis: that children rationally infer their prosociality through making difficult, autonomous choices.",>Nadia Chernyak>Tamar Kushnir,>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0376/index.html
2013,Estimating Multiple Evoked Emotions from Videos,"Video-sharing websites have begun to provide easy access to user-generated video content. How do we find what we want to view among the huge video database? When people search for a video, they may want to know whether the video evokes a certain emotional sensation. The evoked emotion is one of the important factors we consider when we select a video. One of the key concepts of evoked emotions from videos: the evoked emotions are different for each scene and for each viewer. Considering these differences, we obtained human- evoked emotions from 33 videos. We used these emotions to estimate the multiple emotions evoked by each scene of the videos. Using a computational model of emotion estimation based on mid-level visual features, we found that, in individual videos, the same scene evoked multiple emotions. Our results show that a video evoked different emotions from different people.

By applying to a large sample a novel test of concept learning as well as the battery of WM tasks, we found that WM is a strong predictor of the scores on the test, but the WM-learning correlation decreases as the relational complexity of the to-be-learned concepts increases. Such results support those theoretical models of relational learning, which assume that learning of relational concepts (and relations, in general) consumes more WM resources than just the processing of relations which have already been learned.",>Adam Chuderski>Anna Chuderska,>Jagiellonian University in Krakow>Jagiellonian University in Krakow,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0378/index.html
2013,Face age and social status exert different modulatory effects on gaze following behaviour,"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether face age and social status information associated with faces have different effects on gaze following behaviour as an index of joint attention. Participants were instructed to perform goal-directed saccades towards a peripheral stationary target, while a task-irrelevant face with averted gaze was presented. Faces of three different age groups (younger adults; middle-aged adults; and older adults) were associated with fictional résumés which could describe distracters as high or low social status people. Results showed that face age affected both saccade accuracy and latencies. Social status did not have an effect on accuracy and only affected correct saccades with higher latencies by modulating the face age effect. It is argued that the overt orienting of joint attention could be affected both by perceptual and higher order socio-cognitive factors, but at different stages of processing.",>Francesca Ciardo>Barbara F.M.

2013,Towards a Statistical Model of Grammaticality,"The question of whether it is possible to characterise grammatical knowledge in probabilistic terms is central to determining the relationship of linguistic representation to other cognitive domains. We present a statistical model of grammaticality which maps the probabilities of a statistical model for sentences in parts of the British National Corpus (BNC) into grammaticality scores, using various functions of the parameters of the model. We test this approach with a classifier on test sets containing different levels of syntactic infelicity. With appropriate tuning, the classifiers achieve encouraging levels of accuracy. These experiments suggest that it may be possible to characterise grammaticality judgements in probabilistic terms using an enriched language model.",>Alexander Clark>Gianluca Giorgolo>Shalom Lappin,">King's College London, United Kingdom>King's College London, United Kingdom>King's Colllege London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0380/index.html
2013,Knowledge Helps: Mechanistic Information and Numeric Evidence as Cognitive Levers to Overcome Stasis and Build Public Consensus on Climate Change,"A clear, growing consensus indicates an urgent need for humans to reduce the burgeoning effects of global climate change (“global warming” or GW). Apt public instruction seems central to achieving critical behavioral changes, but some researchers suggest that U.S. climate attitudes are doomed to cognitive stasis (i.e., that little will be gained by educating the public). Herein are four studies that counter the stasis view. Our laboratory has previously reported findings that (1) virtually no Americans know the basic climate change mechanism, yet it (2) is quickly learned (in a few minutes, e.g., with a 400-word text), which (3) increases climate change acceptance. Below, Studies 1 and 4 replicate and extend these results to demonstrate (a) efficacy with an online presentation and broader populations and (b) retention up to a month after learning the mechanism. Studies 2-4 explore roles for germane numerical information using estimation with feedback. Study 2 shows that (d) misleading, cherry-picked, statistics can decrease climate change acceptance (and shake metacognition), while Studies 3 and 4 show that (e) surprising scientific information must be presented with care for it to foster beliefs in line with climate science’s consensus. In sum, contrary to unnecessarily pessimistic (and correlational) ""stasis"" arguments, highly germane science information can clearly change the public’s understandings and opinions.",>Dav Clark>Michael Ranney>Jacqueline Felipe,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0381/index.html

The results revealed that task constraints (e.g., tapping to a metronome) alter the fractal structure of a given aspect of the behavior (e.g., inter-tap interval) and decouple its long-term interactions with other aspects of the behavior (e.g., key-press duration).

2013,Motor experience interacts with effector information during action prediction,"Recent theory suggests that action prediction relies of a motor emulation mechanism that works by mapping observed actions onto the observer action system so that predictions can be generated using that same predictive mechanisms that underlie action control. This suggests that action prediction may be more accurate when there is a more direct mapping between the stimulus and the observer. We tested this hypothesis by comparing prediction accuracy for two stimulus types. A mannequin stimulus which contained information about the effectors used to produce the action and a point stimulus, which contained identical dynamic information but no effector information. Prediction was more accurate for the mannequin stimulus. However, this effect was dependent on the observer having previous experience performing the observed action. This suggests that experienced and naive observers might generate predictions in qualitatively difference ways, which may relate to the presence of an internal representation of the action laid down through action performance.",>Lincoln Colling>William Thompson>John Sutton,">Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia>Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0383/index.html
2013,Models of Human Category Learning: Do they Generalize?,"Generalization to new examples is an essential aspect of categorization. However, recent category learning research has not focused on how people generalize their category knowledge. Taking generalization to be a critical basis for evaluating formal models of category learning, we employed a ‘minimal case’ approach to begin a systematic investigation of generalization. Human participants received supervised training on a two-way artificial classification task based on two dimensions that were each perfect predictors. Learners were then asked to classify new examples sampled from the stimulus space. Most participants based their judgments on one or the other dimension. Varying the relative levels of dimension salience influenced generalization outcomes, but varying category size (2, 4, or 8 items) did not. We fit two theoretically distinct similarity-based models (ALCOVE and DIVA) to aggregate learning data and tested on the generalization set. Both models could explain important aspects of human performance, but DIVA produced a superior overall account.",>Nolan Conaway>Kenneth Kurtz,">Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA>Binghamton University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0384/index.html

The three activities are (1) interleaved worked examples with student explanations; (2) enhanced feedback with tutor-provided explanations of problem solving steps; and (3) explicit scaffolding of the reasoning steps in this abductive process-of-elimination reasoning task. The study included four between-subject conditions, a baseline condition in which students exclusively solved standard problems, and three conditions in which students engaged in one of the new learning activities along with standard problem solving. The scaffolded-reasoning condition was most successful in fostering robust learning, as measured by transfer, retention, and preparation for future learning tests. The enhanced feedback condition, in contrast, yielded the poorest performance on the robust learning measures.",>Albert Corbett>Ben MacLaren>Angela Wagner>Linda Kauffman>Aaron Mitchell>Ryan Baker,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Columbia University Teachers College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0385/index.html

In a set of recognition memory experiments using these stimuli, we manipulate the similarity between studied items and between targets and foils, thus investigating the effects of pure perceptual similarity. We also assign values to studied items in order to induce encoding strategies that might emphasize encoding distinctive or overlapping features. Applying a stochastic signal detection model to these data, we find that blocked presentation and increased category size lead to poorer encoding of individual items, indicating that participants fail to encode distinctive features when list homogeneity is increased. Further, items assigned a negative value are encoded more poorly, a sign that participants may attempt to find overlapping features among negative items.",>Gregory Cox>George Kachergis>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0386/index.html
2013,Dimensions of specificity in musical memory: Evidence from metrical restoration,"How is musical memory organized? While classic studies of music perception appealed to schematic or symbolic knowledge structures, recent work suggests that listeners form highly-detailed auditory representations of music. Studies of metrical restoration—memory fill-in of the “beat” of a metrically-ambiguous melody—suggest some organizing dimensions in musical memory. However, many potential dimensions remain unexplored. The current study looked for effects of mode (major vs. minor)—a substantial organizing force in Western music—and timbre (what instrument is playing) on metrical restoration. Both mode and timbre can signify particular musical styles. In Experiment 1, listeners showed timbre specificity in metrical restoration, but not mode specificity. However, in Experiment 2, when timbres were extremely unique (one per melody), restoration effects were not observed, suggesting that too much variability leads to diffuse representations which are too weak to support metrical restoration. Implications for the nature of musical memory are discussed.",>Sarah Creel,">University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0387/index.html
2013,Reasoning with differing tasks and response formats,"This study investigated the role probabilistic and deductive relations play in the reasoning process. It was predicted that when taking an analytic stance to a problem, it would take longer to evaluate inferences when asked how probable it is that the conclusion is true, than when asked whether the conclusion follows or not from the premises. Contrary to this prediction, people responded faster when the response format was continuous. However, there was no effect of argument type with continuous response format, suggesting people did not assess entailment relations in this condition. Options to address the issue further are discussed.

2013,Artificial grammar learning of shape-based noun classification,"Systems of noun classification serve to categorize entities based on a set of semantic and/or phonological features. Previous work, for the most part focused on gender-based classes, has suggested that learners acquiring such systems rely primarily on phonological cues, while semantic cues are used only weakly. We show, using an artificial language learning task with adults, that semantic information alone is sufficient to learn a realistic shape-based classification system, challenging the view of phonology bias. Further, our results show that compared to learners exposed to semantically cohesive categories, learners trained on randomly assigned classes are less successful at recalling the category of exposure items. This finding suggests that, contrary to memory-based theories of learning, categories are not necessarily formed by abstraction from memorized exemplars, but can instead be constructed from lower-level properties that category members share.",>Jennifer Culbertson>Colin Wilson,">George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, United States>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0389/index.html
2013,Moving from Levels & Reduction to Dimensions & Constraints,"Arguments, claims, and discussions about the “level of description” of a theory are ubiquitous in cognitive science. Such talk is typically expressed more precisely in terms of the granularity of the theory, or in terms of Marr’s (1982) three levels (computational, algorithmic, and implementation). I argue that these ways of understanding levels of description are insufficient to capture the range of different types of theoretical commitments that one can have in cognitive science. When we understand these commitments as points in a multi-dimensional space, we find that we must also reconsider our understanding of intertheoretic relations. In particular, we should understand cognitive theories as constraining one another, rather than reducing to one another.",>David Danks,>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0390/index.html
2013,Proactive and Retroactive Interference Effects in Development,"Infants and children are avid learners. This constant aggregation of new knowledge, however, can interfere with past and future learning. Proactive interference (PI) occurs when past learning interferes with new learning, while retroactive interference (RI) is the attenuation of memory for previous learning as a result of new knowledge. Previous work has demonstrated that adults and children display PI and RI effects, but the developmental trajectories of these effects are less clear. The current study developed a new associative learning paradigm to concurrently test PI and RI in preschoolers and adults. Results demonstrated the presence of RI, and these effects were stable across age groups, suggesting that the mechanisms that modulate RI effects may already be mature in these age groups. No PI effects were found in either group, however. This surprising result suggests the role of associative complexity as a possible modulator of PI in these age groups.",>Kevin Darby>Vladimir Sloutsky,">The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0391/index.html
2013,Self-Regulated Learning with Graphical Overviews: When Spatial Information Detracts from Learning,"Graphical overviews have been studied as a method to improve hypertext learning and digital search. Although previous studies have found learning benefits to graphical overviews of single hypertext, it is unclear if these benefits extend to online learning across multiple (independent) documents. Previous research also has found that graphical overviews facilitate domain focus during online search, but it has not been established whether these benefits are derived from the spatial organization of the graphic or its textual content. This research examined the impact of using graphical overviews organized either spatially (i.e., network view) or textually (i.e., outline view) during self-regulated online learning. Assessments focused on deep understanding of science concepts and the relationships between them. Results indicated that the outline view promoted deeper understanding of science concepts and fewer errors about the relationships between them.

2013,Associative strength and semantic activation in the mental lexicon: evidence from continued word associations.,"In a word association task, the probability of producing a certain response to a cue is considered to be a direct measure of associative strength between words in the mental lexicon. The common single word association procedure is limited, since the number of words connected to a cue might be underestimated when a single response is asked. The continued association task overcomes this limitation by asking a person to generate multiple associative responses. To test whether continued strengths allow a better approximation of our lexicon, an experiment was conducted in which participants judged the associative strength between words. Our results show that in contrast to other semantic tasks, continued strength predicts weak to moderate judgments only. Two explanations based on the sampling of information and differential semantic activation of later responses in continued association are proposed. Theoretical implications for semantic activation and methodological implications for derivation of strength are discussed.",>Simon De Deyne>Daniel Navarro>Gert Storms,>University of Leuven>University of Adelaide>University of Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0393/index.html
2013,The Index of Cognitive Activity as a Measure of Linguistic Processing,"This paper reports experimental results on the Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA), a recent micro-level measure in pupillometry which relates processing load to the frequency of rapid small variations in pupil diameter. We collected pupil size data during three language processing tasks (German subject vs. object relative clauses, a grammatical gender violation, and semantic anomalies). We report the first results on the Index of Cognitive Activity for language processing and show that the ICA is responsive to all of our manipulations. We also compare the ICA results to overall pupil dilations and self-paced reading as a measure of processing difficulty. Overall, the use of the ICA as opposed to traditional pupillometry seems promising, as our data provide initial evidence that the ICA may be a faster and more fine-grained measure of cognitive load than overall pupil dilation.",>Vera Demberg>Evangelia Kiagia>Asad Sayeed,">Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Saarland, Germany>Saarland University>Saarland University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0394/index.html

We collected pupil size during a tracking task which was cast in a simulated driving context, as well as for a dual task of simultaneous tracking and language processing. The present results are the first to evaluate the ICA measure on these tasks. We find that the ICA is sensitive both to the simulated driving and the language task, and that it is more responsive to our driving task than overall pupil dilation. Overall, the use of the ICA as opposed to traditional pupillometry seems promising, as our data provide initial evidence that the ICA may be more responsive, and a more fine-grained measure of cognitive load than traditional macro-scale pupil dilation measures.",>Vera Demberg,">Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Saarland, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0395/index.html

This hypothesis however, has to date not been tested. The present paper fills this gap by reporting an experiment on subject vs.~object relative clauses including auxiliaries, as well as by testing Demberg and Keller's hypothesis directly on the Dundee Corpus.

The current study addressed these questions by examining the effects of training on the outcome of category learning in 4- to 5-year-olds and adults. In two experiments, participants were trained on either a classification task or an inference task and then tested with categorization and recognition tasks. The categorical information (i.e., deterministic and probabilistic features) was explicitly given to participants in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2. Results with adults replicate previous findings indicating that participants form different representations in the course of classification and inference training (rule-based representation in the former case and similarity-based representations in the latter case).

2013,"Information Sampling, Conformity and Collective Mistaken Beliefs","Societies sometimes stick to the status quo instead of switching to superior technologies and institutions. Existing explanations often attribute this to a coordination failure due to payoff externalities: people may know that another alternative is superior but nobody has an incentive to switch unless many others do so. We show that a simple learning argument can provide an alternative explanation. When people learn about the alternatives from their own experiences but tend to adopt the behaviors of others, they will mistakenly learn to believe that a popular alternative is superior to a better, but unpopular alternative. Our model neither assumes that agents engage in motivated cognition nor that they transmit mistaken information to others. Rather, it emphasizes the role of a fundamental asymmetry in access to information about popular versus unpopular alternatives. Our model thus provides a novel, sampling-based, explanation of how conformity in behavior can lead to private acceptance.",>Jerker Denrell>Gael Le Mens,>University of Warwick>Universitat Pompeu Fabra,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0399/index.html
2013,Speed Facilitation In The Absence Of Enhanced Recognition For Target-Aligned But Irrelevant Stimuli Under Cross-modal Presentations,"An ignored stimulus is later recognized at enhanced levels if it had previously been aligned with a target from a separate task. This has been demonstrated using both visual and auditory presentations. Here we extend these findings to multisensory conditions. Participants were required to detect immediate repetitions in a sound or picture stream while ignoring superimposed words presented in the opposite modality (either written or spoken, respectively), and then underwent a surprise recognition test for these words. Contrary to the previous unisensory examples (Dewald, Sinnett, & Doumas, in press; Dewald & Sinnett, 2012), a significant difference between recognition rates for target-aligned and non-aligned words was not observed. However, a highly significant difference in response latency was observed, with target-aligned words being responded to much more quickly.

These debates have been difficult to resolve, partially because hypotheses about the decision processes assumed by these strategies have typically been formulated qualitatively, making it hard to test precise quantitative predictions about response times and other behavioral data. One way to increase the precision of strategies is to implement them in cognitive architectures such as ACT-R. Often, however, a given strategy can be implemented in several ways, with each implementation yielding different behavioral predictions.

In the present study, we compared the performance scores obtained in a motor spatial-tapping task with those scores obtained in a battery of three neuropsychological tasks which assess respectively the executive functions of updating (N-back task), inhibiting (Go-noGo task) and switching (Letter-number task). Multiple regression analyses revealed significant and specific effects between the motor task and the classical neuropsychological tasks: the timing error measured at slow tempi in the tapping task predicted the scores observed in the updating task only; the spatial error at faster tempi predicted the scores obtained in the switching task only; the contact times at intermediate tempi predicted the scores obtained in the inhibiting task only.

2013,"Spatial congruity effects reveal metaphors, not markedness","Spatial congruity effects are often interpreted as evidence for metaphorical thinking, but an alternative markedness-based account challenges this view. Here, we compared metaphor and markedness explanations for spatial congruity effects, using musical pitch as a testbed. English speakers who talk about pitch in terms of spatial height were tested in space-pitch compatibility tasks. To determine whether congruency effects could be elicited by any marked spatial continuum, participants classified pitches as 'high' and 'low' or as 'front' and 'back' (both pairs of terms represent marked continuums). We found congruency effects in high/low conditions but not in front/back conditions, indicating that markedness cannot explain congruity effects. A second experiment showed that congruency effects were specific to spatial words that cued a vertical schema (tall/short), and that congruity effects were not based on polysemy (e.g., 'high' referring both to space and pitch). Together, these results suggest that congruency effects reveal metaphors, not markedness.",>Sarah Dolscheid>Cleve Graver>Daniel Casasanto,>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>The New School for Social Research>The New School for Social Research,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0405/index.html

I examine facial recognition performance of 40 participants asked to choose either the most or least attractive face from a series of pairs, and find that recognition of chosen faces is greater than recognition of unchosen, while no effect is found for the valence of faces. Considering these results in tandem with prior results and theories, I argue that a two process account of memory improvements due to choice is necessary, with one deliberative process occurring across all options available to choose from, and the other selective process focused on the actual chosen item. I detail the delineation of these processes, and describe and test the current best accounts of each — the multiple-cue hypothesis, and the self-reference effect for memory.",>Charles Driver,>University of Queensland,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0406/index.html
2013,Motion in Vision and Language: Seeing Visual Motion can influence Processing of Motion Verbs,"In contrast to symbolic models of language understanding, embodied models of language comprehension suggest that language is closely connected with visual and motor processing. In the current study we show that motion words, such as rise or fall, are processed faster if displayed against a background of compatible motion (e.g., upward vs. downward random dot motion with 60% motion coherence). However, this interaction between semantic processing and visual processing only occurred if the word and the motion display were presented simultaneously. If the visual motion display was short-lived and occurred 100 or 200 ms after word-onset, no interactions between language and visual motion were found. We suggest that only in situations that do not allow ignoring or strategically suppressing the visual motion display, supra-threshold visual motion can affect language comprehension.",>Carolin Dudschig>Jan Souman>Barbara Kaup,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0407/index.html

This paper explores this analogy at the detailed level of interaction: to what extent can musical contributions act as conversational turns? We explore this question through an ethnographic study of music lessons. We describe a new transcription notation designed to capture the interactional details of musical contributions. Using this notation we show that although the ultimate objective of a lesson is development of musical performance, the detailed structure of the musical contributions depends on their interactional organisation. We show that musical contributions display interactional structure at the turn and sub-turn level and are closely integrated with other verbal and non-verbal cues as part of the unfolding conversation.",>Sam Duffy>Patrick Healey,">Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom>Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0408/index.html

2013,"Verbal and Nonverbal Cues Activate Concepts Differently, at Different Times","Although the word “dog” and an unambiguous barking sound may point to the same concept DOG, verbal labels and nonverbal cues appear to activate conceptual information in systematically different ways (Lupyan & Thompson-Schill, 2012). Here we investigate these differences in more detail. We replicate the finding that labels activate a more prototypical representation than do sounds, and find that sounds activate exemplars consistent with the source of the sound, such that after hearing a barking sound, people are faster to recognize a dog with an open-mouth than a closed mouth, but critically, only when the sound and picture are presented simultaneously. The results are consistent with perceptual cues indexing their source while labels activating a more decontextualized representation of the target category.",>Pierce Edmiston>Gary Lupyan,">University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States>University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0410/index.html
2013,Language and cognitive load in a dual task environment,"We investigate the effect of linguistic complexity on cognitive load in a dual-task scenario, namely simultaneous driving and language use. To this end, we designed an experiment where participants use a driving simulator while listening to spoken stimuli and answering comprehension questions. Online physiological measures of cognitive load, including the recently established Index of Cognitive Activity, as well as measures of performance in both tasks have been collected with high temporal resolution. The resulting aligned data streams can be used to test a vast array of different hypotheses about the relationship between performance, difficulty, and cognitive load in dual tasks at various levels of temporal resolution and linguistic structure. We present results of the data analysis, including evidence that different linguistic structures may cause measurable changes in cognitive workload on a very fine temporal scale in cases of increased primary task difficulty.",>Nikolaos Engonopoulos>Asad Sayeed>Vera Demberg,">Potsdam University>Saarland University>Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Saarland, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0411/index.html

Metacognitive judgments and performance were measured across biology, literature, and math content. Undergraduates took three shortened SAT II Subject Tests, and provided estimates of their performance both before and after taking each test. The results were that judgments differed across domain and gender. Overconfidence was evident in all domains, although estimates of ability were more accurate after taking a test. Males tended to be more overconfident, while females were less confident yet more accurately calibrated when estimating ability. Students were over-confident in math, bringing into question the existence of math phobia. Improvement in calibration and gender difference in calibration were most noticeable in math.",>Shanna Erickson>Evan Heit,">University of California, Merced, CA, USA>University of California, Merced, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0412/index.html
2013,Candle-Candle-Candle-Candy: Continuous Attraction Toward Previously Seen Phonological Competitors,"We applied the mouse-tracking methodology to a phonological cohort task interpretable as a version of the A-not-B task. In the first experiment, participants had to click a word like “candle” repeatedly on the same side of the computer screen. They then had to click a phonological competitor (“candy”) on the other side. This was contrasted with a condition in which the word to be clicked repeatedly on the same side was phonologically unrelated to the word at the critical trial. We found that the phonological priming increased attraction toward the competitor. In the second experiment, mouse movements revealed attraction towards the competitor as a function of the number of previous presentations. The results demonstrate that phonological competitors can exert influence on responses even if the competitors are not simultaneously presented. These results are predicted by and provide evidence for the dynamic field theory of movement preparation and execution.",>Jesse Falke>Bodo Winter>Michael Spivey,">University of California, Merced, Merced, California, United States>University of California, Merced, Merced, California, United States>University of California, Merced, Merced, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0413/index.html
2013,"Communication and Categorization: New Insights into the Relation Between Speech, Labels and Concepts for Infants","Almost two decades of research has demonstrated that labels facilitate infants’ categorization of novel objects. Some interpret this as evidence of an early link between infants’ linguistic and conceptual systems. Others suggest that these effects stem exclusively from lower-level processing mechanisms in cross-modal perception, and that words promote categorization only because they are more familiar to infants than non-linguistic acoustic stimuli and therefore easier to process. Here we address these discrepant interpretations using a novel approach. We expose infants to unfamiliar non-linguistic stimuli (sine-wave tone sequences), manipulating the exposure conditions. For 6-month-olds, if the novel acoustic stimuli were embedded within a communicative episode, they subsequently facilitated categorization (Experiment 1), but if they were presented in a non-communicative episode, they had no such effect (Experiment 2). We propose a developmental model that takes infants’ burgeoning perceptual and conceptual capacities into account in identifying how communication and words are linked to concepts.",>Brock Ferguson>Sandra Waxman,">Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA>Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0414/index.html
2013,Stopping Rule Selection (SRS) Theory Applied to Deferred Decision Making,"The critical step facing every decision maker is when to stop collecting evidence and proceed with the decision act. This is known as the stopping rule. Over the years, several unconnected explanations have been proposed that suggest nonoptimal approaches can account for some of the observable violations of the optimal stopping rule. The current research proposes a unifying explanation for these violations based on a new stopping rule selection (SRS) theory. The main innovation here is the assumption that a decision maker draws from a large set of different kinds of stopping rules and is not limited to using a single one. The SRS theory hypothesizes that there is a storage area for stopping rules—the so-called decision operative space (DOS)—and a retrieval mechanism that is used to select stopping rules from the DOS. The SRS theory has shown good fit to challenging data published in the relevant literature.",>Mario Fific>Marcus Buckmann,">Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI, USA>Max Planck Institute for Human Development",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0415/index.html
2013,Syntactic priming in language comprehension allows linguistic expectations to converge on the statistics of the input,"Human language is characterized by variability in that the way in which language is used varies depending, for example, on facts about the identity of the speaker or author, the social context, and surrounding linguistic material. Variability poses formidable challenges to the systems underlying language comprehension, which are known to exploit statistical contingencies in the input to overcome the inherent noisiness of perception; nevertheless, we seem to comprehend language with apparent ease. How is this possible? Here we argue that we are able to comprehend language efficiently in part by continuously adapting to the statistics of novel linguistic situations. We argue further that adaptation specifically allows comprehenders’ expectations to converge towards the actual statistics of the linguistic input. Concretely, we show that readers can adjust their linguistic expectations in light of recent experience such that (a) previously difficult structures become easier to process, and, even more strikingly, (b) previously easy to process structures come to incur a processing cost.",>Alex Fine>T.

Participants judged the maximum height they could reach while jumping and they judged the maximum height that the actor could reach while jumping. They did so with and without a weighted backpack, and they did so with and without walking several laps. Results show that before the addition of the weighted backpack, participants rated the actor’s abilities as much closer to their own.

2013,The Effect of Non-Linguistic Patterns on Linguistic Biases,"The present study explores the effects of non-linguistic experiences on biases for linguistic judgments, specifically consonant deletion patterns. When two adjacent consonants come into contact as a result of morphological concatenation, many languages will delete the first consonant (e.g., /bepdok/ becomes /bedok/). Speakers of these languages (as well as English speakers) prefer deletion of the first consonant to the second consonant because the first consonant is perceptually weaker, making it more prone to misrepresentations and modifications. Following exposure to a non-linguistic analogue of consonant deletion in which the second consonant was deleted instead of the first, participants no longer preferred deletion of the first consonant in the metalinguistic judgment task. These results suggest that exposure to non-linguistic materials can interact with linguistic judgments.",>Sara Finley,>Waldorf College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0418/index.html
2013,Using Causal Induction in Humans to Learn and Infer Causality from Video,"For both human and machine learners, it is a challenge to make high-level sense of observations by identifying causes, effects, and their connections. Once these connections are learned, the knowledge can be used to infer causes and effects where visual data might be partially hidden or ambiguous. In this paper, we present a Bayesian grammar model for human-perceived causal relationships that is learnable from video. Two experiments investigate high-level causal induction from low-level visual cues. In the first experiment, we show that a computer can apply known heuristics used for causal induction by humans to learn perceptual causal relationships. In the second experiment, we show that our learned model can represent humans' performance in reasoning about hidden effects in video, even when the computer initially misdetects those effects.",>Amy Fire>Song-Chun Zhu,">UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0419/index.html

However, people make consistent mistakes when regulating such systems, a phenomenon termed SF failure. We introduce holistic (global) versus analytic (local) processing as a cognitive mechanism underlying the hardly understood SF failure. Using a classic SF problem (department store task), we found that (a) solutions to SF problems were up to four times higher when a global task format highlighting global structure compared to a local task format highlighting local elements was used; (b) a more global processing style is connected to higher solution rates to the SF problem; and (c) procedurally priming participants with more global processing results in higher solution rates to the SF problem. In sum, our results point towards global-local processing as a basic explanation for SF failure.",>Helen Fischer>Cleotile Gonzalez,>Heidelberg University>Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0420/index.html
2013,Grammatical Aspect influences Event Duration Estimations: Evidence from Dutch,"This study investigates the effect of grammatical aspect marking in Dutch sentences, on speakers’ estimations of the duration of highly familiar, everyday events. We first established the ‘inherent’ or natural duration of different events (Exp. 1). This was then used for the manipulation of aspect (Exp. 2). Participants dragged a slider across the computer screen to estimate the duration of progressive and non-progressive event descriptions. Findings show how the progressive form extends duration estimations for short events, whereas it shortens the perceived duration of inherently medium and long events. We interpret this as psycholinguistic evidence for the function of aspect in Dutch, i.e., giving an ‘inside’ view of the event and focusing a specific internal time span of the event.",>Monique Flecken>Johannes Gerwien,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, Donders Centre for Cognition>Heidelberg University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0421/index.html

One of the issues still to be resolved is whether these space-time mappings can be automatically activated independently from the goals of the task. Prior attempts to settle this issue have failed to match adequately the temporally relevant and irrelevant tasks.

2013,Surprise! You've Got Some Explaining to Do,"Why are some events more surprising than others? We propose that events that are more difficult to explain are those that are more surprising. The two experiments reported here test the impact of different event outcomes (Outcome-Type) and task demands (Task) on ratings of surprise for simple story scenarios. For the Outcome-Type variable, participants saw outcomes that were either known or less-known surprising outcomes for each scenario. For the Task variable, participants either answered comprehension questions or provided an explanation of the outcome. Outcome-Type reliably affected surprise judgments; known outcomes were rated as less surprising than less-known outcomes. Task also reliably affected surprise judgments; when people provided an explanation it lowered surprise judgments relative to simply answering comprehension questions. Both experiments thus provide evidence on this less-explored explanation aspect of surprise, specifically showing that ease of explanation is a key factor in determining the level of surprise experienced.",>Meadhbh I Foster>Mark T Keane,>UCD>UCD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0423/index.html

We contrast three different ways of computing statistics for independent left and right neighbours with the notion of a frequent frame. We also investigate the role of utterance boundaries as context items and weighting of frequency information in terms of the successful simulation of the noun-verb asymmetry. It is argued that independent contexts can classify items with a higher degree of accuracy than frequent frames, a finding that is more pronounced for larger input sets. Frequent frames classify a larger number of items, but do so with lower accuracy. Utterance boundaries are useful for the development of a noun category, particularly at intermediate levels of frequency sensitivity.",>Daniel Freudenthal>Julian Pine>Gary Jones>Fernand Gobet,>University of Liverpool>University of Liverpool>Nottingham Trent University>University of Liverpool,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0424/index.html
2013,Emotional Speech Processing and Language Knowledge,"How does language knowledge affect processing of paralinguistic information—vocal properties that are not directly related to understanding words? This study investigates links between a listener’s native language, any other languages they may have experience in, and the ability to identify vocal emotional information in those languages. The study focuses on two particular classes of languages: those with lexical tone, such as Mandarin Chinese, which use pitch properties to distinguish otherwise-identical words; and those without lexical tone, such as English. English listeners and bilingual Mandarin-English listeners listened to sentences and categorized the emotional content of English and Mandarin sentences. Half of the sentences were presented normally; the other half were low-pass filtered to remove all but prosodic cues (pitch and timing). English listeners were better at identifying emotions in English sentences, while bilinguals were equally good at identifying emotions in both languages. This indicates better overall emotion recognition from prosody alone for listeners more familiar with a language. It may point to a connection between tone language experience and augmented paralinguistic processing capabilities.",>Conor Frye>Sarah Creel,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0425/index.html

Here we took a game theoretical approach to understand development of cooperation, using the prisoner’s dilemma to test an alternative source of age-differences in cooperative behavior—how children and adults represent the numerical magnitudes of payoffs for cooperating versus not. We found that as incentives increased solely in numerical magnitude, speed of incentive comparisons decreased and cooperation increased. Further, though children tended to be more cooperative than adults, effect of age on cooperation was moderated by speed of incentive comparison. We conclude that representations of numeric value constrain how economic rewards affect cooperation and that children’s greater cooperativeness may be attributed to a poor sense of numerical value.",>Ellen Furlong>John Opfer,>Yale University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0426/index.html

These transitions were simulated in EVOC, an agent-based model of cultural evolution, in which the fitness of agents' actions increases as agents invent ideas for new actions, and imitate the fittest of their neighbors' actions. Both mean fitness and diversity of actions across the society increased with chaining, and even more so with CF, as hypothesized.

To examine the ability to estimate how features progress into a volume, participants viewed 16 pictures of everyday objects (rocks, food, wood) presented with only a single face visible (see Figure 1). Participants reported whether a highlighted region of a picture was present on the surface or extended into the object. If they perceived the region as extending in, they positioned a rod to indicate the angle. Surface responses were rare and instead participants’ readily perceived 3D forms from 2D views. Inspection of frequency histograms revealed a systematic bias to estimate the angle of extension in the 80-110° range.

2013,Computational exploration of task and attention modulation on holistic processing and left side bias effects in face recognition: the case of face drawing experts.,"Drawing artists and non-drawers are like any adult both experts at face recognition. Yet, artists have a richer learning experience with faces: they were trained in rapid sketching of faces. Zhou, Cheng, Zhang and Wong (2011) found that drawing experts showed less holistic processing (HP) for face recognition than non-drawers. Using a computational model of face recognition that did not implement motor processing, we examined whether engagement of local attention and nature of the learning task could account for the reduced HP in drawers without the influence from motor experience. We showed that compared with the non-drawer model that had a global face input (i.e., Hsiao, Shieh & Cottrell, 2008), a drawer model that incorporated both global face and local facial parts (eyes and mouth) in the input showed reduced HP, suggesting the modulation of local attention engagement. In contrast, the other drawer model that used only global face input but learned to perform an additional face part identification task did not show the reduced HP effect. In addition, both drawer models demonstrated stronger left side (right hemisphere) bias than the non-drawer model. Our data thus suggest that engagement of local attention is sufficient to account for the reduced HP in drawers, and that HP and left side bias effects can be differentially modulated by visual attention or task requirements.",>Bruno Galmar>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao,>University of Hong Kong>University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0429/index.html

2013,Semantic Ambiguity Resolution as a Decision Process,"Resolution of the meaning of a semantically ambiguous word requires knowledge about the space of possible meanings of that word, and the selection of a meaning in the light of available evidence and given situational constraints. As such, ambiguity resolution bears many similarities to decision making scenarios more generally. We report on an experiment exploring this analogy by applying some standard manipulations from the decision making literature to a semantic disambiguation task. We explore two particular proposals: (1) that depth of semantic processing can be cast as strategy selection reflecting a risk-sensitive effort-accuracy tradeoff, and (2) that thresholds for inference about meaning in context are situationally flexible and learnable via feedback. One robust property of decision making is people’s ability to use feedback in order to adjust responses to maximize payoffs. Participants completed a semantic entailment judgment task in which they received trial-by-trial feedback, and payoff matrices and decision thresholds were manipulated across conditions. We find an effect of risk, with participants employing different comprehension strategies depending on relative gains and losses. We also find that participants were in fact sensitive to varying decision thresholds and accurately adjusted their behavior to match the constraints on what qualified as a true conclusion in different conditions. We take these findings as preliminary evidence that ambiguity resolution in language can be modeled, at least in part, as involving more general decision processes.",>Nicholas Gaylord>Colin Bannard,>University of Texas at Austin>University of Texas at Austin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0431/index.html

We conducted two experiments with participants with highly imagistic and highly verbal reasoning strategies. The relational inferences differed in how easily they could be visualized.

We know that children’s joint action and planning skills are both undergoing development during the preschool years, but not much is known about how the joint action context influences young children’s planning. In this study, we examined the effect of playing alone or with a joint partner on sequence planning during a problem-solving game in three-year-old children. We found that children were better at planning ahead in the individual than the joint condition of the game despite the joint condition requiring fewer actions on the part of the child.

In this paper, we show that people’s answer depends on whether or not they are asked about what would have caused Bob not to shoot. Something needs to change in order to turn an actual world into a counterfactual world. Previous findings of how people reason about counterfactuals have been mixed: sometimes people appear to backtrack and reevaluate the causes of a counterfactual state (e.g. Rips, 2010). At other times, people appear to treat counterfactuals like interventions that leave the past unchanged (Sloman & Lagnado, 2005). We experimentally manipulated the order in which participants were asked to consider the consequences of a counterfactual state. The results show that participants are more likely to backtrack when explicitly asked to consider a counterfactual’s causes.

Formal musical training is associated with qualitative changes in auditory processing, but the number of years required remains unclear, particularly for any perceptual differences between untrained and minimally trained participants. In this study, participants with zero to over ten years' music training identified the direction of pitch changes in three-sound sequences. Only participants with three or more years' training demonstrated a significant global-local precedence. Individuals without musical training consistently identified the local direction of pitch-change sequence elements better than global pitch changes across each sequence. Although musical training was associated both with greater task accuracy and with global-local precedence, improved accuracy did not explain the musically trained participants' preferential processing of global auditory characteristics.",>Anne Gilman>Elizabeth Ebbets,>Juniata College>Juniata College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0435/index.html
2013,Visual Strategies in Analogical Reasoning Development: A New Method for Classifying Scanpaths,"Development of analogical reasoning is often explained by general maturation of executive functions. A consequence of the involvement of executive functions would be that children and adults differ in the visual strategies they apply when solving analogical problems. Since visual strategies can be studied by means of eye-tracking, we compared the visual scanpaths of children and adults in three different analogical reasoning tasks. This comparison was done by means of a novel technique that combined a recently developed algorithm for computing a “distance” between any pair of scanpaths (Jarodzka, Holmqvist, & Nyström, 2010), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and a neural network classifier. This analysis clearly showed a difference between adults' and children's visual strategies in solving analogy problems. We focus both on the demonstration that adults and children employ different visual search strategies to solve analogy problems and on the novel technique used to do this. This general technique complements other approaches to eye-movement analysis that rely on local properties of scanpaths, in particular, item-fixation times.",>Yannick Glady>Jean-Pierre Thibaut>Bob French,">CNRS, Dijon, France>University of Burgundy>LEAD-CNRS, U. of Burgundy",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0436/index.html

2013,"Inventing Prepares Learning Motivationally, but a Worked-out Solution Enhances Learning Outcomes","Solving an open problem as proposed by inventing and productive failure approaches has been shown to prepare learners effectively for subsequent direct instruction even though invented solutions are often suboptimal for the given problems. Inventing can make the learners aware of knowledge gaps (cognitive) and more curious about and interested in the learning contents (motivational effects). However, working on the same problem with a given (optimal) solution helps avoid misconceptions and disorganized knowledge, while providing useful basic knowledge. Therefore, a given solution could be more effective. In an experiment (N = 42), we tested to what extent working on an open problem (inventing) versus a solution prepares student teachers for learning strategy evaluation. The inventing group invented criteria to evaluate learning strategies while the worked solution group studied the same problem in a solved, worked-out version.

One possible explanation for the development of this ability is the gradual reorganization of semantic knowledge. To measure development of semantic knowledge we developed a new paradigm, the Semantic Space task, which uses distance in a two-dimensional space to infer semantic similarities between two objects. Using this paradigm we examined development of semantic knowledge in young children (preschoolers, kindergarteners, and first-grade children) and in adults. We also examined whether conceptual organization as measured by the Semantic Space task is predictive of children’s scores on a category-based reasoning task.

2013,Classroom activities and off-task behavior in elementary school children,"Maintaining focused attention in the classroom is considered an important factor for successful learning. Loss of instructional time due to off-task behavior is recognized as a significant challenge by both researchers and practitioners. However, there has been little research into the factors contributing to off-task behavior. This paper reports results from the first large-scale study investigating how elementary school children allocate their attention in classroom environments and how patterns of attention allocation change as a function of gender, grade level, and instructional format. The findings indicate that instructional format is related to off-task behavior in elementary school students. These findings can begin to form a foundation for development of research-based guidelines for instructional design aimed to optimize focused attention in classroom settings.",>Karrie Godwin>Victoria Almeda>Megan Petroccia>Ryan Baker>Anna Fisher,>Carnegie Mellon University>Teachers College Columbia University>Carnegie Mellon University>Teachers College Columbia University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0441/index.html
2013,How pitch accents and focus particles affect the recognition of contextual alternatives,"Listeners are sensitive to contrastive alternatives in online language comprehension (e.g., Braun & Tagliapietra, 2010). Such alternatives play a crucial a role in the definition of particles like only which have been found (i) to facilitate recall of contextual alternatives (Spalek, et al., in revision) and (ii) to hamper the rejection of unmentioned alternatives (Gotzner et al., in preparation). The present study investigated the impact of combining a contrastive accent with a particle on memory for contextual alternatives. The results revealed that L+H* accents (contrastive) facilitate recognition of a contextual alternative to the accented item compared with H* accents (non-contrastive). Adding either the particle only or also to the L+H* accent slows probe recognition relative to a condition with bare L+H* accent. Hence, while contrastive accenting directly increases the salience of alternatives in a listener’s mental model, focus particles lead to an initial processing cost.",>Nicole Gotzner>Katharina Spalek>Isabell Wartenburger,>Humboldt-University of Berlin>Humboldt-University of Berlin>University of Potsdam,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0442/index.html
2013,The object without qualities: referring with negative properties,"Two experiments investigated the production and comprehension of referring expressions that contain a negative property (""the marker without a cap""). Experiment 1 showed that participants do use negative properties in their object descriptions, but that they were almost always accompanied by other properties, leading to referential overspecification. In experiment 2, participants identified objects based on descriptions that contained negative properties. While participants were faster in identifying objects that were described with preferred properties such as color, response times for objects described with a negative property (""the marker without a cap"") and a positive property (""the marker with a cap"") did not differ. The results provide behavioral grounds for extending referring expression generation algorithms to include negative properties.",>Martijn Goudbeek>Inge Haagmans>Emiel Krahmer,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0443/index.html
2013,Lay biology in health: How adults conceptualize the benefits of exercise,"We present an approach to health interventions based on the insight that throughout life, individuals construct intuitive theories to predict, explain, and determine how to act on the world. We propose that an intuitive theory-based approach may be useful for teaching adults about the body's biochemical response to exercise. The first step in using this approach is to document the theories that a target population brings to bear on a health domain. We therefore present what is to our knowledge the first investigation of adults' reasoning about exercise. Specifically, we explore how adults explain why exercise confers various benefits, how plausible adults find the physical, emotional, and cognitive benefits of exercise, and how contingent on weight loss adults believe such benefits to be. These findings lay the groundwork for constructing an intervention to motivate adults to exercise more.",>Sarah Gripshover>Ellen Markman,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0444/index.html

The standard scheme only optimizes one design in each experimental stage, although simultaneous optimization of multiple designs per stage can be beneficial, but difficult to implement because of a surge in computation. In this study, we incorporated the adaptive experimentation methodology under a Bayesian framework with differential evolution (DE), an algorithm specialized in multi-dimensional optimization problems to explore the multiple-designs-per-stage approach. By taking advantage of parallel computing, DE is computationally fast. The results showed that the multiple-designs-per-stage scheme resulted in a more stable estimation in the early stages of the parameter estimation.",>Hairong Gu>Jay Myung>Mark Pitt>Zhong-Lin Lu,>Ohio State University>Ohio State University>Ohio State University>Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0445/index.html
2013,Spatial meanings for function words? The link between conjunctions and spatial representations,"While formal theories of language consider function words to have little semantic content, more recent theoretical work has argued that even function words have meaning. Yet, there is little experimental work on the representations underlying the meaning of function words such as conjunctions. In two offline experiments, we examined whether conjunctions (and, or, but, either…or) are associated in systematic but distinctive ways with spatial information. In Experiment 1, participants drew schematic representations to depict how two abstract conjuncts might be connected by each of the four conjunctions. These drawing were evaluated on three spatial dimensions (distance, containment and size). In Experiment 2, participants evaluated how well schematic sketches (that differed in distance, containment, and size) represented different conjunctions. In both experiments, spatial information was systematically and distinctively associated with conjunctions. Either… or and or conjunctions were reliably associated with the use of large distance and separation via containment of the conjuncts. And, by contrast, was associated with shorter distance between, and no containment of, the conjuncts. Finally, but was associated with differences in size. We discuss implications of these results for the spatial foundation of linguistic meaning, and the link between lexical semantics and logic.",>Ernesto Guerra>Tyler Marghetis>Pia Knoeferle,">Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster and Department of Linguistics, Bielefeld University>Department of Cognitive Science, University of California San Diego>Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster and Department of Linguistics, Bielefeld University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0446/index.html
2013,"How does social comparison affect regret and relief in children, adolescents and adults?","Apprehending the development of complex emotions is crucial to understand the development of decision-making. Regret and relief are complex counterfactual emotions, which can arise in private or in social contexts. The aims of the present study were (i) to uncover the development of regret and relief and (ii) to explore the development of a social form of regret and relief in a context of competition. The first experiment provides evidence that the ability to experience regret and relief continues to develop until adolescence, consistent with the implication of the orbitofrontal cortex in their experience. In a context of competition, we observed that adolescents were less able to experience social regret compared to children and adults, whereas their feeling of social relief was reinforced. Besides, adolescents failed to question the appropriateness of their initial decision. This result could provide an explanation for adolescents’ enhanced propensity to engage in risky behaviours.",>Marianne Habib>Sylvain Moutier>Grégoire Borst>Olivier Houdé>Mathieu Cassotti,">LaPsyDÉ, CNRS Unit 3521, Paris Descartes University>LaPsyDÉ, CNRS Unit 3521, Paris Descartes University>LaPsyDÉ, CNRS Unit 3521, Paris Descartes University>LaPsyDÉ, CNRS Unit 3521, Paris Descartes University>LaPsyDÉ, CNRS Unit 3521, Paris Descartes University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0447/index.html

This historically philosophical endeavor is now actively studied in the sciences, with research on visual attention being an especially promising area that can further our understanding of consciousness. A major problem with this cross-disciplinary pursuit, however, is that for philosophers and scientists, the terms consciousness, attention, and conscious attention are ambiguous and used differently even by those within the same academic discipline. The goal of this paper is to begin laying the groundwork for a unified study of consciousness by delineating common terminology for attention and consciousness and by identifying the relationship between the two within the study of conscious attention.

2013,Why verbalization of facial features increases false positive responses on visually-similar distractors: A computational exploration of verbal overshadowing,"Verbal overshadowing refers to a phenomenon whereby verbalization of a non-verbal stimulus (e.g., he had slant eyes) impairs subsequent non-verbal recognition accuracy. In order to understand the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs, we constructed a computational model that was trained to generate an individual-face-specific representation upon input of a noise-filtered retinotopic face (i.e., face recognition). When the model verbalized the facial features before receiving the retinotopic input, the model incorrectly recognized a new face input as one of the different, yet visually-similar, trained items (that is, a false-alarm occurred). In contrast, this recognition error did not occur without prior verbalization. Close inspection of the model revealed that verbalization changed the internal representation such that it lacked the fine-grained information necessary to discriminate visually-similar faces. This supports the view that verbalization causes unavailability/degradation of fine-grained non-verbal representations, thus impairing recognition accuracy.",>Aya Hatano>Taiji Ueno>Shinji Kitagami>Jun Kawaguchi,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0452/index.html

We assessed the role of trust dynamics on perspective-taking activities within conflictive groups, extending the experimental framework used by Hayashi (2012) and including conversational agents for controlling participants’ interactions related to trust dynamics and perspective taking behavior. Results showed that (1) reflections of self/other trust in conflictive groups may influence trust towards other members, and (2) reflections of trust by members with conflicting perspectives may facilitate trust and perspective taking. This suggests that the level of trust dynamics facilitates trust and can function to manifest perspective taking within cooperative groups.",>Yugo Hayashi,>University of Tsukuba,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0453/index.html
2013,How listeners respond to speaker's troubles,"Listeners normally provide speakers with simultaneous feedback such as nods, ""yeah""s and ""mhm""s. These`backchannels' are important in helping speakers to talk e ffectively. Two factors are known to influence when a backchannel is produced; if the speaker is looking at the listener or if the speaker is presenting new information. We investigate a third factor: whether the speaker is having trouble speaking i.e. self-repair. If dialogue is an active collaborative process then listener's responses should be especially critical when trouble is encountered. Using data from a corpus of three person dialogues we show that speaker's rate of self-repair is a better predictor of listener responses than speech rate. We also show that listeners respond strongly to speaker troubles independently of whether the speaker is looking at them. We argue that it is the points at which conversation threatens to go o ff-course that are most signifi cant for coordination.",>Patrick Healey>Mary Lavelle>Christine Howes>Stuart Battersby>Rosemaire McCabe,>Queen Mary University of London>Queen Mary University of London>Queen Mary University of London>Queen Mary University of London>Queen Mary University of London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0454/index.html

2013,Expert Blind Spot in Pre-Service and In-Service Mathematics Teachers: Task Design moderates Overestimation of Novices’ Performance,"To act efficiently in the classroom, teachers need to be able to judge the difficulty of problems from a novice’s perspective. However, research suggests that experts use their own knowledge as an anchor, adjust estimations for others to their own knowledge and thus underestimate the difficulty that a problem may impose on novices. Similarly, experts should underestimate the benefit for novices of task designs derived from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), as – following the expertise reversal effect – these should be rather disadvantageous for experts. We investigated pre-service and in-service teachers’ competencies in estimating the difficulty of mathematical tasks for novices. Thirty-four pre-service teachers and thirteen experienced teachers solved tasks that varied in instructional design (optimized for novices following CLT versus non-optimized). Participants solved each task and then estimated how many students of a fictional 9th grade class would be able to solve that task. Solution frequencies were collected from fifty-two 9th grade students. In both expert groups, overestimation was clearly more pronounced for non-optimized than optimized tasks, suggesting an expert blind spot that can be explained in terms of an expertise-reversal effect. The experts failed to adequately take into account the benefits of didactic task variation for novice learners. However, whereas pre-service teachers’ overestimations of student performance were large and significant both for non-optimized and optimized tasks, in-service teachers’ overestimations were generally small and failed to approach statistical significance. In contrast to pre-service teachers, in-service teachers seem to have a better mental model of what a student is able to achieve, thus making better judgments of student performance.",>Katharina Hellmannn>Matthias Nückles,>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0456/index.html

An authentic performance is one that is natural or genuine, while an inauthentic performance feels faked, forced, or imitative. Study participants were asked to rate the authenticity and skill level of a series of videotaped performances by dancers and stand-up comedians. Performers also rated their own performances. Authenticity ratings amongst viewers were significantly positively correlated. Ratings between viewers and performers were not significant but all positive. A higher correlation between ratings of both authenticity and skill of performances for viewers than for performers suggests that viewers make less of a distinction between authenticity and skill than performers.

2013,Benefits for Processes Cause Decrements in Outcomes: Training Improves Tutors’ Interactivity at the Expense of Assessment Accuracy,"Tutoring gives tutors the opportunity to engage in interactive strategies that help them to assess a tutee’s understanding. However, tutors without teaching experience often do not engage in interactive strategies and, thus, have difficulty with accurately assessing a tutee’s understanding. We conducted an experiment with 39 tutor-tutee dyads to test whether tutors who received training in interactive strategies would become more interactive and more accurate in assessing a tutee’s understanding. Results showed that trained tutors provided a more interactive style of tutoring than untrained tutors. However, due to being more interactive, trained tutors produced less accurate assessments than untrained tutors. This suggests that changing the style of tutoring to implement interactive strategies puts a high burden on a tutor’s cognitive capacity. Hence, there is obviously little cognitive capacity left that could be used to assess a tutee’s understanding. Training methods that automate strategy use might enhance a tutor’s assessment accuracy.",>Stephanie Herppich>Jörg Wittwer>Matthias Nückles>Alexander Renkl,>University of Goettingen>University of Goettingen>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0458/index.html
2013,"Blending and choosing within one mind: Should judgments be based on exemplars, rules or both?","Accurate judgments and decisions are crucial for success in many areas of human life. The accuracy of a judgment or decision depends largely on the cognitive process applied. In research on judgment, decision making, and categorization, two kinds of cognitive processes have often been contrasted: exemplar-based processes, which use similarity to previously encountered items to make judgments, decisions, and categorizations, and rule-based processes, which use abstracted cue knowledge. Although most cognitive models of judgment and decision processes assume that people rely on both processes, they differ in whether they assume that one process is selected or that both processes are blended into a single response. The present research takes a functional perspective and investigates what kind of interaction between the two processes leads to accurate responses. Based on cross- validated simulations in real-world domains, it shows that blending rule- and exemplar-based processes generally leads to better judgments than does choosing between them, suggesting that the default strategy should be a blend of both processes, which is abandoned only when feedback justifies it.",>Stefan Herzog>Bettina von Helversen,">Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>University of Basel, Switzerland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0459/index.html
2013,Using the letter decision task to examine semantic priming,"The present research investigates semantic priming with an adapted version of the word fragment completion task. The letter decision task, as we will call it, holds some advantages over the traditionally used lexical decision task in that it eliminates retrospective semantic matching effects, it avoids the need to construct pseudowords, it is more engaging for participants and it enhances semantic processing, which in turn allows for a more fine-grained investigation of semantic activation. The letter decision task requires participants to complete words, from which one letter was omitted like lett_ce (lettuce), as fast as possible. The study found that words are completed faster when the preceding trial comprised a semantically related fragment like tom_to (tomato) than when it comprised an unrelated fragment like guit_r (guitar). Furthermore, the study provides insight in the nature of the priming effect. It demonstrates that priming effects are larger for strongly associated prime-target pairs.",>Tom Heyman>Simon De Deyne>Gert Storms,">University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium>University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium>University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0460/index.html

Vision research has proposed a number of algorithms applicable to action recognition. However, unlike successes in early visual perception, the past studies have not yet established the computational theory of action recognition. In the present study, we employ a dynamical systems approach and hypothesize that motions are encoded cognitively as a topological structure abstracted from physical particulars. We investigated whether a common topological nature could be found in a type of rhythmic movement. The topological nature of action dynamics showed a striking similarity, which could not have been identified with other analyses where physical properties were retained.

Sentences were presented with capitalized nouns—in agreement with German spelling rules—or completely in lowercase. Overall reading speed was not influenced by the manipulation of capitalization, but fixation durations were affected by the interplay between capitalization and the word classes of the fixated and the succeeding word. As expected, fixations were shorter for capitalized than lowercase nouns, but unexpectedly they were longer when the upcoming word was also a noun. This modulation was reduced when all words were printed completely in lowercase.

Unaddressed recipients benefit from co-speech gestures when speech processing suffers","In human face-to-face communication, language comprehension is a multi-modal, situated activity. However, little is known about how we combine information from these different modalities, and how perceived communicative intentions, often signaled through visual signals, such as eye gaze, may influence this processing. We address this question by simulating a triadic communication context in which a speaker alternated her gaze between two different recipients. Participants thus viewed speech-only or speech+gesture object-related utterances when being addressed (direct gaze) or unaddressed (averted gaze). Two object images followed each message and participants’ task was to choose the object that matched the message. Unaddressed recipients responded significantly slower than addressees for speech-only utterances. However, perceiving the same speech accompanied by gestures sped them up to a level identical to that of addressees. That is, when speech processing suffers due to not being addressed, gesture processing remains intact and enhances the comprehension of a speaker’s message.",>Judith Holler>Louise Schubotz>Spencer Kelly>Peter Hagoort>Manuela  Schuetze>Asli Ozyurek,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Colgate University, Hamilton, NY, USA>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Radboud University Nijmegen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0463/index.html

Children either encountered the same exemplar repeatedly or encountered multiple exemplars across trials. All children did very well on the initial task.

2013,Dilution Effects in Perceptual Information Integration,"In cognitive science there is a paradox: Researchers studying decision making have repeatedly shown that people employ simple and often less than optimal strategies when integrating information from multiple sources. However, researchers working in fields such as categorization, memory, and perception have had great success using optimal models to account for information integration. Is this conflict due to the use of different materials and procedures? We test the hypothesis that stimuli requiring more controlled information integration lead to suboptimal performance, while stimuli that lend themselves to more automatic processing produce more optimal integration. We test for one canonical example of sub-optimal information integration, the dilution effect, using stimuli more commonly found in perception experiments. Dilution was indeed reliable across several conditions. The largest effects occurred in stimuli manipulated so as to discourage automatic processing. We use the Multi-component Information Accumulation model to explain how stimulus presentation influenced cognitive processing.",>Jared Hotaling>Andrew Cohen>Jerome Busemeyer>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>University of Massachusetts>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0465/index.html

Relations between players are manipulated by assigning different roles. The roles embodied the four basic types of human relations in line with Fiske’s relational models theory (Fiske, 1991): communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching, and market pricing (players are assigned roles of team mates, chief and subordinate, partners, and opponents, respectively). Cooperation rates, mutual cooperation, mutual defection, and payoffs gained were subsequently analyzed and compared for a series of forty games. As a result we identified that the market-pricing condition is characterized by considerably lower individual and mutual cooperation, higher mutual defection and lower payoff in comparison to the conditions impersonating the remaining three relational types.",>Evgenia Hristova>Maurice Grinberg>Iskra Georgieva>Milena Borisova,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0466/index.html
2013,When does the majority rule? Preschoolers’ trust in majority informants varies by task domain,"In order to learn about the world, young children rely on information provided by social partners. Past research has shown children consider a variety of factors when learning from others, including consensus. Corriveau, Fusaro, and Harris (2009) found that in an object labeling task, children trust responses that receive majority support, and they concluded that children prefer members of a majority as social informants. However, it is possible that children prefer majority members only in domains that rely strongly on socially constructed norms, such as object labeling, where non-social information is unavailable. We formalized this prediction using a rational model of learning from testimony across tasks, and compared our model’s predictions to children’s responses in object labeling and causal learning tasks. We find that in a causal learning task, a domain that relies less on socially constructed norms, children rely more on their personal observations than informant testimony.",>Jane Hu>Daphna Buchsbaum>Thomas Griffiths>Fei Xu,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0467/index.html
2013,Visual motion processing and perceptual decision making,"We present a novel, biologically plausible model of visual motion processing and perceptual decision making that is independent of the number of choice categories or alternatives. The implementation is a large-scale spiking neural circuit consisting of: 1) a velocity filter using the principle of oscillator interference to determine the direction and speed of pattern motion in V1; 2) a representation of motion evidence in the middle temporal area (MT); and 3) integration of sensory evidence over time by a higher-dimensional attractor network in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). We demonstrate the model by reproducing behavioral and neural results from classic perceptual decision making experiments that test the perceived direction of motion of variable coherence dot kinetograms. Specifically, these results capture monkey data from two-alternative forced-choice motion decision tests. We note that without any reconfiguration of the circuit, the implementation can be used to make decisions among a continuum of alternatives.",>Aziz Hurzook>Oliver Trujillo>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0468/index.html
2013,What’s Up can be Explained by Language Statistics,"Concept-location facilitation effects for words presented in isolation have been cited as evidence for embodied cognition. Prior work has demonstrated that words found in high physical locations (e.g., bird) are processed faster at the top of the screen and words found in low physical locations (e.g., fish) are processed faster at the bottom of the screen. In a response time experiment we presented participants with physical-location words from existing studies at the top or bottom, top or center, and center or bottom of the screen. We did this in order to determine if word judgments were made with respect to an absolute location on the screen (embodied explanation) or with respect to a relative location in comparison to other words included in the experimental session (statistical linguistic explanation). For animate words we found a concept location facilitation effect for words presented at the top of the screen, at the center of the screen, and at the bottom of the screen. In addition, bigram frequencies explained RTs to center words. Findings indicated that subjects made judgments relative to other words on the screen and not relative to their absolute location on the screen, lending support to a statistical linguistic explanation of the findings.",>Sterling Hutchinson>Max Louwerse,">University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA>University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0469/index.html

Examining spatial referencing behavior across different tasks, we compared samples from four different countries speaking the same language with respect to their application of the intrinsic frame of reference (FoR) and the three variants of the relative FoR. Our findings indicate influences of factors beyond language: While the four French-speaking samples showed an overall preference for the reflection variant of the relative FoR, they differed significantly regarding the extent to which reflection and the intrinsic FoR were applied. Moreover, in all samples, characteristics of the referenced objects, namely whether they were animate or inanimate, influenced FoR use.

2013,Watching Gestures during Learning about Movements with Dynamic Visualization Activates the Human Mirror Neuron System: A fNIRS Study,"This study investigates whether viewing human gestures facilitates learning about non-human biological movements and whether correspondence between gesture and to-be-learned movement is superior to non-correspondence. Functional near-infrared-spectroscopy was used to address whether gestures activate the human mirror-neuron-system (hMNS) and whether this activation mediates the facilitation of learning. During learning participants viewed triples of visualizations (animation – gesture video – animation). Results showed that for low-visuospatial-ability learners corresponding gestures led to higher cortical activation in the inferior-frontal cortex (part of the hMNS) and better learning outcomes, whereas for high-visuospatial-ability learners the type of gesture had no influence. Furthermore, results showed that – if presented with non-corresponding gestures – only low-visuospatial-ability learners who activated their inferior-parietal cortex (also part of the hMNS), improve their learning.

2013,A robustness approach to theory building: A case study of language evolution,"Models of cognitive processes often include simplifications, idealisations, and fictionalisations, so how should we learn about cognitive processes from such models? Particularly in cognitive science, when many features of the target system are unknown, it is not always clear which simplifications, idealisations, and so on, are appropriate for a research question, and which are highly misleading. Here we use a case-study from studies of language evolution, and ideas from philosophy of science, to illustrate a robustness approach to learning from models. Robust properties are those that arise across a range of models, simulations and experiments, and can be used to identify key causal structures in the models, and the phenomenon, under investigation. For example, in studies of language evolution, the emergence of compositional structure is a robust property across models, simulations and experiments of cultural transmission, but only under pressures for learnability and expressivity. This arguably illustrates the principles underlying real cases of language evolution. We provide an outline of the robustness approach, including its limitations, and suggest that this methodology can be productively used throughout cognitive science. Perhaps of most importance, it suggests that different modelling frameworks should be used as tools to identify the abstract properties of a system, rather than being definitive expressions of theories.",>Liz Irvine>Sean Roberts>Simon Kirby,">Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Tuebingen, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Language Evolution and Computation research unit, University of Edinburgh, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0472/index.html
2013,Context Dependent Utility: Modeling Decision Behavior Across Contexts,"One significant challenge in creating accurate models of human decision behavior is accounting for the effect of context. Research shows that seemingly minor changes in the presentation of a decision can lead to drastic shifts in behavior; phenomena collectively referred to as framing effects. Previous work has developed Context Dependent Utility (CDU), a framework integrating Appraisal Theory with decision-theoretic principles. This work extends existing research by presenting a study exploring the behavioral predictions offered by CDU regarding the multidimensional effect of context on decision behavior. The present study finds support for the predictions of CDU regarding the impact of context on decisions: 1) as perceptions of pleasantness increase, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 2) as perceptions of goal-congruence increase, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 3) as perceptions of controllability increase, i.e., perceptions that outcomes would have been primarily caused by the decision maker, behavior tends towards risk-seeking.",>Jonathan Ito>Stacy Marsella,">Institute for Creative Technologies (University of Southern California), Playa Vista, CA, United States>Institute for Creative Technologies (University of Southern California), Playa Vista, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0473/index.html
2013,A computational exploration on the role of semantic memory in episodic future thinking,"Episodic future thinking refers to a human cognitive process which generates successive predictions of events that are likely to occur in a cue-specific context in the future. An emerging view is that semantic memory as well as episodic memory contributes to this process, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. We built a computational model that learned to predict the next event upon a presented event (sequence prediction model). After learning the statistical structure in the training sequence, the model was tested for generating successive self-predictions of events triggered by a cue. The generated sequence of events captured some phenomenological features of patients with semantic dementia when the semantic system of the model was damaged. The role of semantics in episodic future thinking and the usefulness of a sequence prediction model are discussed.",>Yuichi Ito>Taiji Ueno>Shinji Kitagami>Jun Kawaguchi,">Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan>Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan>Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan>Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0474/index.html
2013,The Impact of Problem Space on Reasoning: Solving versus Creating Matrices,"Creative reasoning in ill-defined problem spaces operates differently from classical reasoning in well-defined spaces. To systematically compare the two in an identical knowledge domain, we applied a classical intelligence test: the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), in combination with two tests of creativity: the Test for Creative Thinking - Drawing Production (TCT-DP) and the newly developed Creative Reasoning Task (CRT), in which participants are asked to create an SPM-like item, to two age groups (N1 = 511, 4-12y old; N2 = 205, 6-10y old). For SPM and CRT the knowledge domain consists of relationships amongst geometrical components in 3 x 3 matrices. We developed a typology for scoring the number and complexity of the relationships used in these matrices. For the SPM, we scored frequencies of relationships solved and for CRT those created, and interpreted the scores in terms of differences and similarities between classical and creative reasoning in cognitive development.",>Saskia Jaarsveld>Thomas Lachmann>Cees van Leeuwen,">University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Rheinland Pfalz, Germany>University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Rheinland Pfalz, Germany>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0475/index.html
2013,Visual Recognition using a Combination of Shape and Color Features,"We develop and implement a new approach to utilizing color information for object and scene recognition that is inspired by the characteristics of color- and object-selective neurons in the high-level inferotemporal cortex of the primate visual system. In our hierarchical model, we introduce a new dictionary of features representing visual information as quantized color blobs that preserve coarse, relative spatial information. We run this model on several datasets such as Caltech101, Outdoor Scenes and Underwater Images. The combination of our color features with (grayscale) shape features leads to significant increases in performance over shape or color features alone. Using our model, performance is significantly higher than using color naively, i.e. concatenating the channels of various color spaces. This indicates that usage of color information per se is not enough to produce good performance, and that it is specifically our biologically-inspired approach to color that results in significant improvement.",>Sepehr Jalali>Cheston Tan>Joo-Hwee Lim>Jo-Yew Tham>Sim-Heng Ong>Paul Seekings>Elizabeth Taylor,">National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore, Singapore>Institute for Infocomm Research>Institute for Infocomm Research>Institute for Infocomm Research>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0476/index.html
2013,Encoding Co-occurrence of Features in the HMAX Model,"We introduce a method for encoding co-occurrence of features in the HMAX model of visual recognition, and conduct a series of experiments to investigate the contribution of co-occurrence towards better recognition performance. We show that classification accuracy is increased by adding a higher-order layer to the HMAX processing hierarchy, whereby co-occurrence of features is encoded as a new dictionary of features. We show that concatenation of mean pooling, max pooling and co-occurrence information results in better classification results on three datasets (Caltech101, a subset of Caltech256, and TMSI Underwater Images). Overall, we show that incorporating co-occurrence statistics into a biologically-inspired model of visual recognition provides a boost in classification performance above that produced by incorporating occurrence statistics alone.",>Sepehr Jalali>Cheston Tan>Joo-Hwee Lim>Jo-Yew Tham>Sim-Heng Ong>Paul Seekings>Elizabeth Taylor,>National University of Singapore>Institute for Infocomm Research>Institute for Infocomm Research>Institute for Infocomm Research>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0477/index.html
2013,The Assumption of Class-conditional Independence in Category Learning,"This paper investigates the role of the assumption of class-conditional independence of object features in human classification learning. This assumption holds that object feature values are statistically independent of each other, given knowledge of the object's true category. Treating features as class-conditionally independent can in many situations substantially facilitate learning and categorization even if the assumption is not perfectly true. Using optimal experimental design principles, we designed a task to test whether people have this default assumption when learning to categorize. Results provide some supporting evidence, although the data are mixed. What is clear is that classification behavior adapts to the structure of the environment: a category structure that is unlearnable under the assumption of class-conditional independence is learned by all participants.",>Jana Jarecki>Björn Meder>Jonathan D.

2013,"Similarity, causality and argumentation","Similarity is a notion that is widely used both in cognitive science and in argumentation theory. These research programs have, however, developed in large part separately and in consequence rely on disparate notions of similarity. Only recently there has been a proposal for specifying how similarity actually plays a role in judging slippery slope arguments. We present here further theoretical discussion and empirical evidence in order to show how similarity can play a role in slippery slope arguments and in argumentation in general. In the experiment presented here, we manipulated the availability of causal information, and showed that people are sensitive to it when judging arguments’ strength. We conclude that similarity between causal properties of the elements presented in arguments is crucial for arguments’ strength assessments.",>William Jimenez-Leal>Christian Gaviria,>Universidad de los Andes>Universidad de los Andes,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0479/index.html

Our first two experiments investigate scenarios in which agents are choosing among multiple options, varying the efficacy of the forsaken alternatives to examine the role of optimality in attributing responsibility. Experiment 3 tests whether optimality considerations also play a role in attribution of causality more generally.

2013,Learning complementary action with differences in goal knowledge,"Humans, as a cooperative species, need to coordinate in order to achieve goals that are beyond the ability of one individual. Modeling the emergence of coordination can provide ways to understand how successful joint action is established. In this paper, we investigate the problem of two agents coordinating to move an object to one agent’s target location through complementary action. We formalize the problem using a decision-theoretic framework called Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs). We utilize multiagent Q-learning as a heuristic to obtain reasonable solutions to our problem and investigate how different agent architectures, which represent hypotheses about agent abilities and internal representations, affect the convergence of the learning process. Our results show, in this problem, that agents using external signals or internal representations will not only eventually perform better than those that are coordinating in physical space alone but also outperform agents that have independent knowledge of the goal. We then employ information theoretic measures to quantify the restructuring of information flow over the learning process. We find that the external environment state varies in its informativeness about agents’ actions depending on the agents’ architecture. Finally, we discuss how these results, and the modeling technique in general, can address questions regarding the origins of communication.",>Jeremy Karnowski>Edwin Hutchins,>UCSD>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0481/index.html
2013,Representational Shifts Towards the Prototype in Memory for Hue,"Representational shifts in memory have been a recent topic of interest and debate (Blanco & Gureckis 2012; Lupyan, 2008; Richler, Gauthier & Palmeri, 2011; Richler, Palmeri & Gauthier, 2012). Whether there are true systematic biases in memory due to a stimulus being labeled has been proposed and contested. The fundamental proposal that representations shift toward the prototype has not previously been demonstrated. In the present experiment, participants judged colored silhouettes by color category or by preference, then were asked to remember the hue of the original silhouette among five narrowly distinct options. By using the single dimension of hue, we are able to show prototypical representational shifts in memory for colored silhouettes after a few minutes. We did not observe a difference between color labeled and preference judged silhouettes, refuting the claim that labeling is the source of prototypical representational shifts.",>Laura Kelly>Evan Heit,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0482/index.html
2013,Adaptive Foraging: Effects of Resource Conditions on Search Paths in a Web-Based Foraging Game,"Foraging is a search process common to mobile organisms, and foraging paths commonly exhibit statistical patterns akin to Lévy walks. There may be common factors and benefits underlying these patterns, but investigations are hindered by difficulty in assessing and manipulating search environments and task conditions. In the present study, a simple foraging game was developed to isolate and manipulate two factors hypothesized to make Lévy walks adaptive search strategies—sparsity, and spatial clustering of targets in the search environment. Players navigated a fuel-limited ship over a 2D grid to find as many targets as possible, rendered as asteroids in outer space. Over 1800 participants were recruited to play using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, in order to widely sample the parameter space defined by degrees of target sparsity and clustering. Observed search paths resembled Lévy walks with memory, and those of high performers were found to vary adaptively with clustering, but not sparsity. Results indicate that Lévy-like walks can emerge from search strategies and algorithms adapted to environments with clustered resources.",>Bryan Kerster>Christopher Kello>Theo Rhodes>Ralph Bien-Aime,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced>SUNY Oswego>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0483/index.html

We explore how a metacognitive cue, in particular the partner’s confidence or uncertainty, can modulate the credibility of an explanation. Two experiments showed that explanations are accepted more often when delivered by an uncertain conversational partner. Participants in Experiment 1 demonstrated the general effect by interacting with a pseudo-autonomous robotic confederate. Experiment 2 used the same methodology to show that the effect was applicable to explanatory reasoning and not other sorts of inferences. Results are consistent with an account in which reasoners use relative confidence as a metacognitive cue to infer their conversational partner’s depth of processing.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Daniel Gartenberg>Kun Hee Park>J.

2013,Mental simulation and the construction of informal algorithms,"We describe two studies that show that when individuals who are not programmers create algorithms, they rely on mental simulations. Our studies concerned a railway domain in which carriages are rearranged – a simple environment but equivalent in computational power to a Turing machine. Participants successfully solved rearrangement problems (Experiment 1), and created algorithms to solve them (Experiment 2) and their performance corroborated the use of simulation. The participants tended to use loops and to prefer while-loops even though they are of greater computational power than for-loops. Their ability to create algorithms for abstract problems improved when they first had to create algorithms for more concrete problems. We devised a computer program that creates its own algorithms for rearrangement problems. It generates Lisp functions that operate on lists and creates descriptions of them in everyday language. The complexity of the resulting algorithms predicts participants’ difficulty in devising them.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Phil Johnson-Laird,>Naval Research Laboratory>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0486/index.html
2013,Channels of multimodal communication: Relative contributions to discourse understanding,"When people communicate in normal environments, they use several communication channels, such as the verbal channel, prosody (non-segmental aspects of sound) and the visual channel. There is a great variety of views on the relative contribution of these channels to the overall understanding of messages. Linguists typically limit their interests to the verbal channel alone, while social psychologists often emphasize the importance of non-verbal components. This study offers an experimental methodology allowing to empirically evaluate the contributions of different channels. Two experimental studies are reported that used different stimulus material: movies and recorded conversation. According to the results of the experiments, all of the communication channels are highly significant, the verbal channel being the leading one. Experiment participants experienced difficulties in certain unusual conditions, such as the combination of the prosodic and visual channels without the verbal component.

2013,Quantifying the Coherence of Pedestrian Groups,"Coherent collective behavior emerges from local interactions between individuals that generate group dynamics. An outstanding question is how to quantify group coherence in order to understand the nature of these dynamics. We investigate this problem in the context of a small group of pedestrians instructed simply to walk to a goal. To measure the degree of coordination in a group, we employed principal components analysis to estimate dimensional compression, and cross-recurrence quantification analysis to estimate the coupling strength between individuals. The results indicate lower-dimensional behavior and more stable coupling in real groups compared to reshuffled virtual groups. These findings demonstrate spontaneous local coordination in pedestrian groups that gives rise to coherent collective behavior, and offer an approach for investigating group dynamics in more complex contexts.",>Adam Kiefer>Stephane Bonneaud>Kevin Rio>William Warren,">Brown University, Providence, RI, USA>Brown University>Brown University>Brown University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0488/index.html

2013,Selection of Linker Type in Emphatic Reduplication: Speaker’s Intuition meets Corpus Statistics,"Turkish Emphatic Reduplication (TER) occurs in adjectives and adverbs to accentuate their meanings. The current experimental study to investigate the selection of the linker type in TER indicated that responses from the participants correlate with some lexical statistics. The result relies on the statistics from a corpus with approximately 2 million Turkish words, which we use in lieu of lexical statistics. The frequency order of linker choice reported by the participants was exactly the opposite of the order of frequency of words in which the linker and the first consonant co-occur consecutively in the corpus. Such a direct link to lexicon was unexpected. We suggest that TER, an apparently phonological operation, depends on lexical access for selecting the appropriate linker whose cooccurrence with the initial consonant of the reduplicated word is infrequent. Our results relate morphology and lexicon in more ways than the blocking phenomena, and suggest that TER may be morpholexical.",>Özkan Kılıç>Cem Bozşahin,">Department of Cognitive Science, Graduate School of Informatics,

The goal of the present research is to draw from these separate lines of research to ask how changes in basic cognitive capacities and formal learning gains may be related. The present study employed a game in which a ship moves through different environments using forces. The game teaches the basic relationships between objects and forces in Newton’s Laws of Motion. Students played one of two versions of the game. The predictive version encouraged planning and reflection, by allowing students unlimited time to place forces along a path. In the real-time version, forces immediately affected the player when selected. The results suggest that learning was equivalent across the versions, but changes in attentional capacities may differentially contribute to learning between versions.",>Stephen Killingsworth>Douglas Clark,">Peabody College, Vanderbilt University>Peabody College, Vanderbilt University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0491/index.html

Transfer of conceptual content in bilingual number word learning,"Bilingual speakers are confronted with a unique challenge when learning language as they must learn to express the same concept in two separate languages. Here, we examine whether learning number words in one language (i.e., L1) facilitates the acquisition of analogous number words in a second language (i.e., L2) or whether extensive experience and familiarity with numbers within the second language is required to learn words in L2. To do so, we tested 68 bilinguals speakers between the ages of 2 and 4 years and show that conceptual knowledge of numbers in L1 reliably predicted children’s conceptual knowledge of numbers in L2, suggesting that knowledge transferred from one language to the other. The effect, however, was limited to two developmental transitions: one-knower to two-knower and subset knower to CP-knower. Familiarity with L2 numbers as well as age were also significant predictors of children’s conceptual understanding of numbers.",>Katherine Kimura>Katie Wagner>David Barner,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0492/index.html

The present study investigated comprehension of subject vs. object who and which direct questions (DQs), embedded questions (EQs) and relative clauses (RCs) in 39 cognitively healthy native speakers of Spanish. The elderly participants (n = 21) were further classified according to their scores on a general cognitive test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), into a group with low MoCA scores, LM (n = 10), and a group with normal MoCA scores, NM (n = 11). A mixed-model, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the elderly participants achieved significantly worse accuracy and speed than the young participants (Y) in all tasks. Accuracy was significantly lower and reaction times significantly longer in the LM group compared to the NM group in DQs and RCs. Accuracy in comprehension of EQs was also worse in LM compared to NM, with no significant difference in RTs between the two groups. The results are explained within the competition model and reliance on a language-specific cueing strategy.

MTT is further presumed to have a distinct, concrete though dispersed neural correlate, and hence describes a neuro-cognitive phenomenon. Opening with a brief sketch of the development and current state of the art, the essay pursues three central aims: Firstly, it constitutes a plea for more conceptual rigour on the cognitive side of the fence, so as to ensure that meaningful lessons can be drawn from neurological enquiry about it. Secondly, a partial conceptual qualification of the necessary requirements of MTT as traditionally conceived is proposed, as they seem vague, uninformative and arbitrary. Finally, a revision of MTT is attempted, which aspires to include a variety of mental states so far not associated with MTT. MTT, as it is currently defined and investigated, I will argue, stands too heavily in the genealogical debt of research into episodic memory, and suffers from an astonishing neglect of considerations pertaining to imagination.",>Markus Kneer,>Institut Nicod Paris,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0495/index.html

We found that the morphology intervention provided a greater improvement than the vocabulary intervention, especially for children in grade 5. To compare the long-term effects of the two interventions, we tested the children’s spelling ability six-months after the conclusion of the intervention program. Results show that both grades maintain an increase in spelling accuracy compared to their pre-intervention performance. Additionally, the children in grade 5 who received morphological instruction retained more spelling knowledge than those who received the vocabulary instruction. These results suggest that teaching children about the structure of complex words supports their spelling ability in the long-term, providing evidence for the important role of morphological knowledge in literacy development.",>Kendall Kolne>Katherine Hill>Laura Gonnerman,>McGill University>McGill University>McGill University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0497/index.html
2013,How big is the BFG? The impact of redundant size adjectives on size perception,"In two experiments we study how redundant size modifiers influence the perceived size of objects. We show that when objects are referred to with overspecified descriptions (for example, using a description like “the large red chair” in a situation where all chairs are equally large but different in color), participants subsequently estimate the object to be larger than when objects are referred to using minimally distinguishing descriptions (e.g., “the red chair”). In Experiment 1, we show this effect with adult language users and different kinds of size modifiers. In Experiment 2, the same effect is shown for children of two different age groups (7- and 10-year olds), and for different kinds of visual size contrasts. Interestingly, we observe an inversely proportional relation between the age of our child participants and the difference in size estimates for minimal and overspecified descriptions, suggesting that language users gradually become better at avoiding false pragmatic inferences from redundant adjectives as they grow older.",>Emiel Krahmer>Marret Noordewier>Martijn Goudbeek>Ruud Koolen,">Tilburg center for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), Tilburg University>Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Leiden University>Tilburg center for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), Tilburg University>Tilburg center for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), Tilburg University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0498/index.html

An Adaptive Conjoint Study with Two Independent Samples,"Cyberbullying is defined as bullying via electronic means including the defining characteristics of repetition over time, intent to harm, and power imbalance. However, this normative top-down definition is discussed controversially. We argue that the term “cyberbullying” and the associated defining criteria might constrict our focus artificially. Therefore, we investigate bottom-up which aspects of cyber cruelty contribute to victims’ distress in an adaptive conjoint design with two independent samples (sample 1: n = 131; sample 2: n = 82). Six potentially relevant factors were investigated, each with multiple attributes: number of incidents, perpetrator status, perpetrator motive, and type, medium, and publicity of cyber incident. Contrary to the definition of cyberbullying, number of incidents, publicity, and type of cyber cruelty emerged as most important factors. These results allow us to further map the cognitive representation of cyber cruelty and are practically relevant for the definition and measurement of cyberbullying.",>Christina Kuhlmann>Stephanie Pieschl>Torsten Porsch,>Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster>Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster>Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0500/index.html

We argue that the control achieved at different levels of hierarchy is important for different aspects of agency. In the current study, we investigate how changes in control at the perceptual-motor level and at goal level influence implicit and explicit measures of sense of agency. In a given trial, participants were first required to aim at a target in a noisy environment and then shoot at the target. After certain interval, a circle flashed at the location where participant aimed while pressing the trigger.

2013,Methods for Classifying Errors on the Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices Test,"Although many psychometric tests, like Raven’s Progressive Matrices, are commonly evaluated according to total score, additional variables can lend insight into the underlying cognitive processes. We examine conceptual errors on the Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) test. We present a complete classification of error types on the SPM using a two-kind coding scheme, yielding ≥ 95% inter-rater reliability. We also examine how to extract error data from a computational model, and we present a method for measuring errors through systematic ablation to create a “population” of models whose performance can be examined as a group. We present a preliminary analysis of error patterns on the SPM from typically developing individuals, individuals diagnosed with autism, and a computational model called ASTI. We discuss what the error patterns suggest regarding cognition on the SPM and routes towards improving the ASTI model.",>Maithilee Kunda>Isabelle Soulières>Agata Rozga>Ashok Goel,>Georgia Institute of Technology>Université du Québec à Montréal>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0502/index.html
2013,Experts’ Explanations Engage Novices in Deep-Processing,"Experts and intermediates fundamentally differ in the ways they explain subject matter to novices. Experts provide less details but in a highly coherent format, whereas intermediates provide many additional details but in a format with low coherency. In a recent study, we found that experts’ explanations enabled novices to acquire more transferable and flexible knowledge as opposed to explanations by intermediates mainly due to the higher coherence of experts’ explanations. In order to investigate more directly how experts’ and intermediates’ explanations differently triggered novices’ processing of the explanations, we conducted a think-aloud study. Results indicated that novices learning with an expert’s explanation processed the explanations deeper than novices with intermediates’ explanations. In line with this, deep processing was significantly related to novices’ transfer. Thus, expertise can be regarded as an essential prerequisite for generating effective instructional explanations that engage novices to process the subject matter deeply and to generate transferable knowledge.",>Andreas Lachner>Matthias Nückles,">University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany>University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0503/index.html
2013,Do risk-averse people lie less? A comparison of risk-taking behavior in deceptive and non-deceptive scenarios,"We studied decision making in situations in which there is a monetary incentive to take risk, and in which the risk taking option sometimes involves deception. We conducted a within participant experiment in which we compared risk taking in deception conditions to pure (non-deceptive) gambles with equivalent risks and outcomes. We confirmed the four-fold pattern of risk attitudes in both conditions. We found that participants chose fewer risky options when the risky option was associated with deception, but that those who deceived more in the deception condition also took more risks in the gamble condition. We conclude that people who tend to take risks in gambles, also take them when it involves deception, although to a lesser extent.",>Tei Laine>Kayo Sakamoto>Tomi Silander,>Scientist>Scientist>Senior research fellow,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0504/index.html

Findings show that preparing prior to collaborating improved learning, but a difference was not detected in the type of preparation. In addition, differences in learning outcomes were only present in measures of deep knowledge. Analyses used a multilevel method targeted to dyadic data.

2013,Measuring the separate effects of practice and fatigue on eye movements during visual search,"The present study examined how time-on-task (i.e., practice and fatigue) influences eye movements during visual search. First, we examined how practice influences eye movements during an extended visual search task. Results replicate the findings that over the course of a visual search task, performance improves and fixation duration increases. Yet changes in fixation duration did not correlate with changes in search performance. Next, we examined how fatigue influences eye movements during an extended visual search task. To manipulate fatigue, participants either did or did not receive breaks. Those who did not receive breaks replicated our initial findings. Critically, participants who did receive breaks showed no increase in fixation duration over the course of the visual search task. These results indicate that the increase in fixation duration with time-on-task reflects fatigue, and that this measure of fatigue can be derived independent of measures of performance improvements, such as shorter response times",>Sophie Lanthier>Evan Risko>Daniel Smilek>Alan Kingstone,>University of British Columbia>University of Memphis>University of Waterloo>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0506/index.html

Here, we extend our Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) model of ERP data elicited during the reading of single word forms to the simplest more temporally extended phenomenon: the ERP repetition effect.

2013,Movement Correlation as a Nonverbal Cue in the Judgment of Affiliation during Social Interaction,"It has been demonstrated that brief exposure to behavioral information is sufficient for making accurate social judgments. Movement coordination during social interaction, is one potential cue. Although coordination between individuals has been identified, our ability to perceive it when making judgments regarding affiliation (friends vs. strangers) is unknown. In the present studies, we investigated how correlated movement contributes to observers’ accuracy when judging affiliation. Using correlation map analysis to quantify coordination, we showed that individuals familiar with each other correlated their movements more frequently. Observers were able to use coordination as a cue, but only when the information presented was restricted to movement related to speech (i.e. while only viewing faces). These results suggest that observed movement coordination is influenced by speech-related movements. We suggest that social perception is multi-faceted and cues may be prioritized differentially based on availability.",>Nida Latif>Adriano Barbosa>Eric Vatikiotis-Batesom>Monica Castelhano>Kevin Munhall,">Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia>Queen's University>Queen's University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0508/index.html
2013,Overcoming Screen Inferiority in Text Learning,"When studying, the reliability of metacognitive monitoring, the predicted achievements at test, is strongly associated with the quality of study regulation and with ultimate performance at test. Previous studies that compared learning texts on screen to learning from printed texts found that screen learners performed worse and were overconfident about their success. The present research examined two methods for overcoming screen inferiority in these respects. Gaining experience with the study-test task with six different texts allowed improvement. Writing keywords after a delay from learning already eliminated screen inferiority from the first studied texts. In both methods, predictions of performance did not reflect changes in test scores. The two methods clearly affected screen and paper learners differently. This study outlines directions for overcoming screen inferiority, but also calls attention to the effects of context on cognitive and metacognitive processes, beyond the mere interaction between the person and the task content.",>Tirza Lauterman>Rakefet Ackerman,>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0509/index.html

Simple probabilistic contingencies between pairs of response cues were used in such a way that the sequence of cues moved predominantly in one direction (i.e. either clockwise or counterclockwise). Performance on cued and miscued responses was compared for a group given a hint about the abstract rule describing the relationship between the response cues, and a group given no information about this relationship. Experiment 1A demonstrated that XYZ and XYX subsequences showed performance differences when the location of the target on each trial was random. Experiment 1B showed that giving participants the explicit hint affected XYZ subsequences more than XYX subsequences.

This idea is enforced by the standard view of relations that says that relata always come in a certain order. There is, however, an alternative view on relations, the antipositionalist view, according to which the constituents of the complexes of a relation neither come in a certain order, nor do they occupy positions. Instead, a relation is conceived as a network of interrelated complexes.

2013,Categorization and Abstract Similarity in Chess,"Chess experts remember meaningful chess positions better than novices (de Groot, 1978; Chase & Simon, 1973). This can be explained with a larger number of chunks in experts' long-term memory (Gobet & Simon, 1998). These chunks are mainly based on visual representations, that is, pieces on squares. However, a recent experiment highlighted that experts prefer to group chess positions by abstract similarities that cannot be explained purely visually (Linhares & Brum, 2007). Based on these data it was claimed that chess expertise, in addition to chunks, crucially relies on abstraction and analogies. These data and the conclusions were heavily criticized because the instructions strongly biased the participants to group positions in a certain way (Bilali'c & Gobet, 2009). Here, we successfully replicated this experiment with less explicit instructions. In addition, we collected category labels for the groupings that allowed us to explore the abstract principles that participants used.",>Pablo León-Villagrá>Frank Jäkel,">Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück>Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0513/index.html

Native speakers of English and native speakers of Cantonese participated in implicit learning (IL) experiments that involved different learning materials. In Experiment 1, both participant groups showed evidence of learning a mapping between articles and noun animacy. In Experiment 2, neither group showed learning of the mapping between articles and a linguistically anomalous concept (the number of capital letters in an English word or the number of strokes in a Chinese character). In Experiment 3, the Chinese group, but not the English group, showed evidence of learning a mapping between articles and a concept derived from the Chinese classifier system. It was concluded that first language knowledge affected implicit language learning, and that IL, at least when natural language learning is concerned, is not a completely unconstrained domain-general mechanism.",>Janny H.C.

2013,Reading Motor Intentions,"Some evidence in very recent psychological studies have demonstrated that motor simulation ability is crucial for the correct understanding of social intentions. The present study was conducted first to confirm that the nature of the motor intention leads to early modulations of movement kinematics. Then, we tested whether humans could read an agent’s intention when observing the very first element of a complex action sequence. Results revealed early variations in movement kinematics and further showed that human agents can use these deviants to distinguish above chance level between three different social actions. Similar performance levels were found using an artificial classifier (Neural Network) and this procedure demonstrated furthermore that decisions could be taken on the basis of information contained in the first 500ms of movement kinematics. Taken together these results confirm the importance of motor simulation for adapted social interaction, and suggest how robotic adaptive controllers may use as input low-level motor information (e.g. kinematics) to afford biologically inspired social behaviors.",>Daniel Lewkowicz>Yvonne Delevoye-Turrell,">Université Lille 3, Lille, France>Université Lille 3, Lille, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0515/index.html

In particular, the present work focuses on people’s true-false judgment of statements found on websites and the likelihood of sharing these statements. The results from Experiment 1 revealed that, for false statements, collective opinion had little influence on people’s true-false judgments, but, for true and debatable statements, their judgments were biased toward collective opinion. The results from Experiment 2 indicated that the likelihood of sharing the true, debatable, and false statements followed the collective opinion, and that people were less likely to share false statements than debatable or true ones without collective opinion. These findings extend past work on social influence and advance understanding of how people make judgments and decisions in social media websites.",>Huaye Li>Yasuaki Sakamoto,>Stevens Institute of Technology>Stevens Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0516/index.html
2013,Different Strategies in Solving Series Completion Inductive Reasoning Problems: An fMRI and Computational Study,"Neural correlate of human inductive reasoning process is still unclear. Number series and letter series completion are two typical inductive reasoning tasks, and with common core component of rule induction. Previous studies have demonstrated that different strategies are adopted in number series and letter series completion tasks even the underlying rules are identical. In the present study, we examined cortical activation as a function of two different reasoning strategies for solving series completion tasks. The retrieval strategy, used in number series completion tasks, involves direct retrieving of arithmetic knowledge to get the relations between items. The procedural strategy, used in letter series completion tasks, requires counting a certain number of times to detect the relations linking two items. The two strategies require essentially the equivalent cognitive processes, but have different working memory demands (the procedural strategy incurs greater demands). The procedural strategy produced significant greater activity in areas involved in memory retrieval (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and mental representation/maintenance (posterior parietal cortex, PPC). An ACT-R model of the tasks successfully predicted behavioral performance and BOLD responses in DLPFC and PPC.

2013,Inductive and deductive reasoning in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"This study examined the hypothesis that individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show a selective deficit in inductive reasoning but are unimpaired in their ability to make deductive inferences. 100 participants from an analog sample made inductive or deductive inferences about arguments that differed according to causal consistency and validity. They also completed a task examining sensitivity to the implications of diverse evidence in induction. Participants who were high or low on obsessive-compulsive symptoms showed similar patterns of induction based on causal knowledge and similar patterns of deduction. However, those with the highest level of OCD symptoms showed less of a preference for diverse evidence when evaluating inductive arguments, compared to those with the lowest level of symptoms. This difference was found across both OCD-relevant and OCD-neutral items, and persisted when the effects of group differences in general ability were controlled. These results indicate that both inductive reasoning based on background knowledge and deductive reasoning are intact in individuals with high OCD-traits but the use of inductive heuristics such as evidence diversity is impaired.",>Janice Liew>Brett Hayes,>University of New South Wales>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0518/index.html
2013,The Influence of the Attention Set on Exogenous Orienting,"The processing of incoming sensory information relies on interacting mechanisms of sustained attention (the ability to focus attention and ignore irrelevant stimuli) and attentional capture (the ability of certain stimuli to reflexively attract one’s attention). Being able to precisely predict what can capture attention when it is engaged in a demanding task is important both for understanding the nature of attention as a cognitive system and also for practical applications. While evidence indicates that exogenous capture, a mechanism previously understood to be automatic, can be eliminated while concurrently performing a demanding task, we reframe this phenomena within the theoretical framework of the ‘attention set’ (Most et al., 2005). Consequently, the specific prediction that cuing effects should reappear when dimensions of the cue overlap with those in the attention set (i.e., elements of the demanding task) was empirically tested and confirmed. Suggestions for further theoretical refinement and empirical testing are discussed.",>Ahnate Lim>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0519/index.html
2013,Modeling the Relational Shift in Melodic Processing of Young Children,"As a ubiquitous trend in the cognitive development of children, the ‘relational shift’ accounts for a change in preference for absolute percepts towards a preference for relational percepts, and is observed across a wide variety of domains. Extensive evidence indicates that this prepotency for relational processing is also observed in how children process melodies. When recalling melodies, younger children typically recall more absolute pitch properties than older children, while the exact opposite occurs in older children. Using DORA (Discovery Of Relations by Analogy; Doumas et al., 2008), a domain-general symbolic-connectionist model of relation learning, we simulated the relational shift in melodic perception of children age 3-6 years based on an experiment by Sergeant and Roche (1973). DORA’s performance matched the children’s well, suggesting common developmental and perceptual mechanisms between the relational shift in melodic processing and the shift seen across other domains.",>Ahnate Lim>Leonidas Doumas>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0520/index.html
2013,Effects of Response and Presentation Format on Measures of Approximate Number System Acuity,"Human adults, infants, and non-human animals are believed to be equipped with an Approximate Number System (ANS) supporting non-symbolic representations of numerical magnitudes. Recent research has questioned both the validity and reliability of tasks intended to measure acuity in the ANS. Issues with validity and reliability might be due to differences in methodology. In the present study, we compare four tasks designed to measure ANS acuity, using a within-subjects design. The tasks are compared with respect to response and presentation format effects previously studied in the psychophysics literature, but largely ignored in the ANS literature. We find a presentation format effect and show that when non-symbolic numerical stimuli are presented sequentially the magnitude of the second stimulus is overestimated. Further, the results indicate that people’s sensitivity to differentiate between non-symbolic numerosities is dependent on response format. The implications of the results to measures of ANS acuity are discussed.",>Marcus Lindskog>Anders Winman>Peter Juslin,">Uppsala University, Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden>Uppsala University, Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden>Uppsala University, Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0521/index.html

The present study was designed to investigate text titles – a factor known to affect cognitive learning processes- as well as the timing of keywording tasks – a factor known to affect metacognitive processes – and their effects on metacognitive monitoring and learning outcomes.

2013,The relationship between blocking and inference in causal learning.,"The blocking effect in causal learning, once taken as a hallmark of associative learning, has recently been explained in terms of an explicit deductive reasoning process. Yet when the conditions necessary for deduction are removed, a small blocking effect is often still present. We examined the relationship between blocking and participants’ performance on analytical thinking and probabilistic reasoning measures. Inferential processes predict blocking or an absence of blocking in this situation, depending on the observer’s consideration of conditional probabilities. Although Bayesian inference predicts blocking, most individuals are not inclined to use this form of probabilistic reasoning explicitly, an observation we confirmed using a logical problem with similar properties to the relationships present in the blocking effect. Furthermore, participants who showed the greatest capacity for analytical reflection were less likely to show a blocking effect, suggesting that blocking in causal learning is the product of an intuitive and unreflective thought process.",>Evan Livesey>Jessica Lee>Lauren Shone,>University of Sydney>University of Sydney>University of Sydney,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0523/index.html

2013,Spatial correspondence parameters at the basis of transfer of learning in social contexts,"Recent works indicated that performing a joint spatial compatibility task with an incompatible stimulus-response mapping affects subsequent joint Simon task performance, eliminating the social Simon effect (social transfer of learning effect or SToL effect). Crucially, the SToL effect was not tuned to the specific identity of the co-actor, and depended on the overlap between the spatial relations of the practice and transfer tasks. Starting from these findings, this study aimed at investigating which spatial relations between stimulus (S), response (R) or participant (P) positions are relevant for the SToL effect to occur. Two experiments were run in which the participant-response associations were incompatible (participants were required to respond with crossed arms), whereas the stimulus-response and stimulus-participant associations were manipulated. We found that learning derived from the practice task did not transfer to the subsequent task when stimulus-response associations were spatially incompatible and stimulus-participant associations were compatible (Experiment 1). However, a SToL effect was evident when stimulus-participant associations were spatially incompatible and stimulus-response associations were compatible (Experiment 2), hence suggesting that the spatial relation between stimulus and participant positions is crucial for the SToL effect to occur.",>Luisa Lugli>Cristina Iani>Nadia Milanese>Sandro Rubichi,>University of Modena and Reggio Emilia>University of Modena and Reggio Emilia>University of Modena and Reggio Emilia>University of Modena and Reggio Emilia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0526/index.html

Results revealed a congruency effect between the type of calculation made and the direction of the movement performed, but only when participants experienced it through a passive mode.

However, it is unclear whether there are traits that predict intergenerational preferences across a variety of dilemmas.

A short form diagnostic tool known as the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) was used to determine the severity of participant PTSD symptomatology. Using a text capture paradigm participants were then asked to write a neutral narrative or a narrative that described their traumatic event.

Reports in Japanese and in English written by second year Japanese university students, who had received instruction in academic discourse pertaining to critical evaluation, were analyzed for use of evaluative statements. This revealed no disadvantage for use of the Japanese language, which is considered as having a more indirect structure that may make critical evaluation more difficult. English proficiency test scores, however, were found to correlate with production of evaluative statements in English, but not in Japanese, suggesting that inadequate second language proficiency could limit critical evaluation use. The second year students’ use of evaluative statements was also found higher than their first year counterparts’ (who had not yet received instruction), suggesting that such instruction is beneficial for skills development in both languages.",>Emmanuel Manalo>Kyoko Watanabe>Chris Sheppard,>Waseda University>Waseda University>Waseda University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0531/index.html
2013,Moral choices: The influence of the “Do not play God” principle,"A wide literature demonstrates that people prefer harm caused by omissions over equal or lesser harm caused by actions. This omission bias has been explained referring to several principles, such as causality or responsibility. A convincing research view has been suggested by Sunstein (2005): harmful acts are generally worse than harmful omissions when moral intuitions reflect the “Do not play God” principle: inactions interfere less with the “natural order.” In two preliminary studies, we examine the influence of the “Do not play God” principle on individuals moral preferences, using the switch version of the trolley problem. Study 1 demonstrates that our participants’ justifications for their inaction choice explicitly refer to the intention of not interfering with the “natural order”. Study 2 demonstrates that the presence of stimuli influencing a reduction of protagonist’s decisional autonomy (e.g. an authority) activates the “Do not play God” principle, leading them to prefer inaction.",>Francesco Mancini,>Scuola di Psicoterapia Cognitiva,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0532/index.html
2013,Towards agents with human-like decisions under uncertainty,"Creating autonomous virtual agents capable of exhibiting human-like behaviour under uncertainty is becoming increasingly relevant, for instance in multi-agent based simulations (MABS), used to validate social theories, and also as intelligent characters in virtual training environments (VTEs). The agents in these systems should not act optimally; instead, they should display intrinsic human limitations and make judgement errors. We propose a BDI based model which allows for the emergence of uncertainty related biases during the agent's deliberation process. A probability of success is calculated from the agent's beliefs and attributed to each available intention.

2013,A Computational Framework for Attentional 3D Object Detection,"We present a computational framework for the detection of unknown objects in a 3D environment. It is based on a visual attention system that detects proto-objects which are improved by iterative segmentation steps. At the same time a 3D scene model is built from measurements of a depth camera. The detected proto-objects are projected into the 3D scene, resulting in 3D object models which are incrementally updated. Finally, environment- and object-based inhibition of return enables to withdraw the attention from one object and switch to the next. We show that the system works well in cluttered natural scenes and can find and segment objects without prior knowledge.",>German Martin Garcia>Simone Frintrop,>Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhems-Universität Bonn>Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhems-Universität Bonn,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0534/index.html

Using eye movement data, we analyzed a perspective that indicated the type of rules that participants consider. The results show that, only in negative instances, participants considered rules from the perspective that they used for finding and confirming the initial rule. We concluded that, when participants face negative instances, they tried to change the initial rule peripherally to explain them. This appeared in the form of a longer consideration from an initial perspective in negative instances.",>Miki Matsumuro>Kazuhisa Miwa,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0535/index.html
2013,Automatic generation of naturalistic child-adult interaction data,"The input to a cognitively plausible model of language acquisition must have the same information components and statistical properties as the child-directed speech. There are collections of child-directed utterances (e.g., CHILDES), but a realistic representation of their visual and semantic context is not available. We propose three quantitative measures for analyzing the statistical properties of a manually annotated sample of child-adult interaction videos, and compare these against the scene representations automatically generated from the same child-directed utterances, showing that these two datasets are significantly different. To address this problem, we propose an interaction-based framework for generating utterances and scenes based on the co-occurrence frequencies collected from the annotated videos, and show that the resulting interaction-based dataset is comparable to naturalistic data. We use an existing model of cross-situational word learning as a case study for comparing different datasets, and show that only interaction-based data preserve the learning task complexity.",>Yevgen Matusevych>Afra Alishahi>Paul Vogt,">Department of Culture Studies, Tilburg University, Tilburg, the Netherlands>Department of Communication and Information Sciences, Tilburg University, Tilburg, the Netherlands>Department of Communication and Information Sciences, Tilburg University, Tilburg, the Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0536/index.html

We investigate the case of two people walking and talking together, a common combination of joint actions. In an experiment, pairs talked together in four varying conditions of mobility. A narrator told a story to a partner. They did this while either standing immobile, walking along a straight-line itinerary, or walking along a complex itinerary featuring several turns. They also completed a walking task along a complex itinerary without having to tell a story. One person (the navigator) was also entrusted with a map of the itinerary. We analyzed how participants coordinated turning while telling a story. Narrators relied more on verbal means to signal turning, and were more distracted during the turn, leading to more repetition of story-related content.",>Eric Mayor>Adrian Bangerter,>University of Neuchâtel>University of Neuchatel,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0537/index.html
2013,Insight Follows Incubation In The Compound Remote Associates Task,"The phenomenon of insight is frequently characterized by the experience of a sudden and certain solution. Anecdotal accounts suggest insight frequently occurs after the problem solver has taken some time away from the problem (i.e., incubation). Here we used Compound Remote Associates problems to examine how incubation affects the subjective experience of insight at different levels of problem fixation. We hypothesized that incubation would elicit a mind-set change resulting in improved problem solving performance regardless of the initial level of fixation. Second, we predicted to the extent that insight reflects a person’s assessment of mind-set change, the experience of insight would be more likely after incubation. Results were consistent with these predictions. These findings suggest that the role of incubation in producing insight may have more to do with changing mind-set than forgetting information that fixates problem solvers.",>Sean Mc Carthy>John Malony>Robert Morrison,>Loyola University Chicago>Loyola University Chicago>Loyola University Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0538/index.html
2013,Modeling a reaction time variant of the Perruchet effect in humans,"This paper presents a reaction time (RT) experiment that follows on from the work of Perruchet, Cleeremans, and Destrebeceqz (2006), investigating the extent to which reaction times (RTs) are governed by the conscious expectancy of a particular response. In this experiment, participants were presented with a single stimulus (which we will call the conditioned stimulus; CS) followed by one of two outcomes (which we will call unconditioned stimuli; USs); to which participants had to make an appropriate instrumental response. On every trial we recorded the time taken to make this response and participants were asked to rate their expectancy that one of the USs (US1) was going to occur. We found that the expectancy rating for US1 correlated negatively with RT on US1 trials. Over successive runs of reinforcement, when participants rated US1 as less likely to occur they were slower to respond to US1 (lower ratings, higher RTs). When we calculated the expectancy for US2 as the complement of that for US1 expectancy, expectancy of US2 correlated positively with RTs. Thus, across runs of reinforcement, participants responded more quickly to US2 when considering US2 less likely (low rating, low RT). We argue that the requirement to make a conscious expectancy rating results in participants attending more to US1 occurrences than those of US2. This results in a qualitatively different relationship between conscious expectancy and automatic responses that cannot be reconciled by a single processing system account. A dual processing system explanation of learning is proposed to explain these results. In support of this position, we successfully modeled our US2 RT data using a modified version of the Augmented simple recurrent network (Yeates, Jones, Wills, McLaren, & McLaren, 2013).",>Amy McAndrew>Fayme Yeates>Frederick Verbruggen>Ian P.

2013,Can US sensitization account for the electrodermal variant of the Perruchet effect?,"During experiments employing Perruchet's (1985) paradigm there are runs of reinforced (CS-US) trials and non-reinforced (CS-noUS) trials. Conditioned responding (CR) is measured, for example, using eyeblink responses (Perruchet, 1985), reaction times (Perruchet, Cleeremans, & Destrebeceqz, 2006), or changes in skin conductance (SCR; McAndrew, Jones, McLaren, & McLaren, 2012), as well as an online measure of expectancy for the unconditioned stimulus (US). A double dissociation between CR and conscious expectancy of the US is typically found, whereby expectancy of the US decreases while the CR increases across runs of successively reinforced trials. A gambler’s fallacy explanation can be offered for the expectancy data, whereas an associative explanation can be used to explain variations in the CR (consistent with the dual processing theory of McLaren, Green, & Mackintosh, 1994). However, skeptics of this effect have proposed nonassociative explanations of the CR data seen in these experiments. They note that every CS-US pairing is confounded by the presence of the US. Therefore, it is possible that US sensitization, the phenomenon whereby repeated US presentations leads to stronger unconditioned responding to the US, could produce the increasing CR pattern with successive reinforcements (Weidemann, Tangen, Lovibond, & Mitchell, 2009). Two experiments are presented investigating whether US sensitization can explain the recently published electrodermal version of the Perruchet effect.",>Amy McAndrew>Gabrielle Weidemann>Ian P.L.

2013,"Reasoning about diamonds, gravity and mental states: The cognitive costs of theory of mind","Theory of mind (ToM) is required when reasoning about mental states such as knowledge, beliefs, desires, and intentions. Many complex reasoning tasks require domain-general cognitive resources such as planning, resistance to interference, and working memory. In this paper we present a study of the additional cognitive costs of reasoning about mental states. We presented participants with sequential games in which they have to reason about another player. In the so-called player condition, the other player is reasoning about the participant, whereas in the so-called balance condition, the other player is reasoning about a balance scale. Both types of games require the same comparisons, but only differ in the required depth of ToM reasoning. Games in the player condition require one additional switch between perspectives. The results show that participants make different types of mistakes in the player condition as compared to the balance condition. This finding implies a different reasoning process when reasoning about mental states. The results also show faster decreasing reaction times in the balance condition than in the player condition. Based on these findings, we argue that reasoning about mental states requires unique cognitive resources.",>Ben Meijering>Hedderik Van Rijn>Niels A Taatgen>Rineke Verbrugge,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0541/index.html
2013,Modeling the Development of Determiner Productivity in Children's Early Speech,"The English definite and indefinite articles (also known as determiners) are a useful index of early morphosyntactic productivity in children's speech, and give evidence about children's representation of syntactic abstractions. Previous work (i.e. Pine and Lieven, 1997) used a measure of productivity that shows a strong sensitivity to sample size and does not account for the relationship between adult input and children's learning. In this paper, we develop a more robust metric by employing a hierarchical Bayesian model to characterize the degree of generalization implicit in observed determiner usage. By inferring parameters for a generative model over longitudinal corpora, we measure the trajectory of grammatical category abstraction. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that child learners exhibit adult-like patterns of generalization quite early in the acquisition of determiners.",>Stephan Meylan>Michael Frank>Roger Levy,">University of California, Berkeley>Stanford University>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0542/index.html

Here we explore principles of spatial reasoning in Germans and Russians. We compared the performance of Russians in three different settings to the performance of Germans. The task was to construct layouts of wooden blocks according to verbal instructions, describing the relations of these blocks. Subsequently pieces of new information, introduced as incontrovertible facts and partly contradicting the initial descriptions, were given. Participants re-arranged the blocks to take into account the new facts. Recent research conducted with Germans has shown that – although alternatives are logical equivalent - there are preferences for certain solutions. The question was whether Russians show the same or different preferences. Our results suggest that construction and revision of spatial models follow similar principles. However, we observed differences between the groups regarding the flexibility to apply a principle based on the order of words in a sentence.",>Maria Mikheeva>Leandra Bucher>Jelica Nejasmic>Markus Knauff,">Kazan (Volga Region) Federal University, Department of Psychology>Justus Liebig University Giessen, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University Giessen, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University Giessen, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0543/index.html
2013,Problem Solving Between Action-Selection and Action-Completion in a Simple Domain,Experiment 1 demonstrates that problem solving knowledge can be applied while a move is in progress in certain Tower of London (ToL) problems. A two-stage move process is often delayed in the second stage when participants have been misled by similarity to a previous problem. We suggest this is indicative of misgivings about the chosen move caused by on-going analysis of the move that is being made. Experiment 2 swapped the stages of the two-stage process and again reported more hesitancy in the second stage when participants had been misled. We conclude that it is desirable for models of problem solving to evolve so that they can apply the same learned problem solving knowledge both before a move is selected and while the move is being made. We then describe a model of ToL problem solving that fulfills these criteria and has been computationally-implemented within an embodied cognitive architecture.,>Gareth Miles>Stephen Payne,>University of South Wales>University of Bath,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0544/index.html

One view posits that similarity-based induction, utilizing perceptual features, may allow for increased encoding and higher memory accuracy on recognition tests. While category-based induction, utilizing semantic information, may result in limiting encoding of perceptual detail, thus resulting in decreased memory accuracy. In Experiment 1, we attempted to impair spontaneous categorization by presenting a second Working Memory load task. In Experiment 2, we attempted to impair perceptual processing by introducing a second Visual Search task.

In this study, we seek to understand how the top-down influence of typicality affects initial reference to an object. We use real world, every-day objects, and focus on the visual properties of SHAPE and MATERIAL. Our findings suggest that there is a tendency to select the atypical over the typical.

We investigated two types of stoic behavior: keeping-off behavior, in which students restrain themselves from requesting help, i.e., keep levels of help support at a minimum, and self-fading behavior, in which students voluntarily lower levels of support on their own volition. Three experiments were conducted. Overall, results showed that the participants actually exhibited stoic behavior when learning in an actual classroom setting. Self-fading was more difficult than the keeping-off behavior. The participants who maintained levels of support at a minimum through exhibiting active keeping-off behavior achieved greater learning gains, suggesting that stoic behavior resulted in positive impacts on learning. However, our experiment did not detect this effect for self-fading behavior. These experimental results were discussed with the assistance dilemma problem, generally occurring in instruction by intelligent tutoring systems.",>Kazuhisa Miwa>Hitoshi Terai>Nana Kanzaki>Ryuichi Nakaike,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0548/index.html

2013,The facilitatory role of sound symbolism in infant word learning,"Sound symbolism or the nonarbitrary link between language sound and meaning are commonly found across many languages of the world. A well-known example is the association between rounded vs. angular shapes and labels (i.e., Köhler, 1929/1947). Previous research has shown that sound symbolic words play facilitative role for preschool children’s novel verb learning, helping children identify what aspects of motion events should be mapped to verbs. In this research, we explore whether sound symbolism may facilitate language learning in human infants who have just begun to learn word meanings. Sound symbolism may be a useful cue particularly at the earliest stages of word learning, because this cue seems to be available without needing prior word learning experience. Using a habituation paradigm and a Bayesian model-based analysis, we demonstrated that 14-month-old infants could detect Köhler-type (1947) shape-sound symbolism, and could use this sensitivity in their effort to establish the word-referent association.",>Michiko Miyazaki>Shohei Hidaka>Mutsumi Imai>H.

2013,Beliefs About a Speaker Affect Feeling of Another's Knowing,"People's estimations of how certain speakers are of their knowledge (FOAK) match speakers' own estimation (FOK) of how certain they are (Brennan & Williams, 1995). This is because others can interpret the verbal and nonverbal cues of (un)certainty that a speaker displays (Brennan & Williams, 1995; Swerts & Krahmer, 2005). Estimating another's certainty thus seems to be driven by the bottom-up processing of speaker-displayed cues. In this paper, we explore the top-down influence of beliefs about a speaker on judgments of a speaker's certainty. In a perception study, we varied whether a speaker's proclaimed profession would make him an expert or a novice on the topic he was questioned on. Such beliefs were shown to influence participants' ratings of the speaker's certainty, in addition to speaker-displayed cues. Thus, next to the bottom-up processing of speaker-displayed cues, the top-down processing of beliefs about a speaker influences judgments of others' certainty.",>Lisette Mol>Anna Kuhlen>Ruben van der Steen>Mike Obbens,">Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands>Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany>Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0551/index.html

This raises an important question: Why don´t many users protect their personal data more eagerly? We propose that a lack of memory for what information has been disclosed to which audience contributes to this privacy-neglecting behavior in OSNs. We transferred the paradigm of target monitoring to a fictitious OSN and varied the degree of risk associated with self-disclosure. In a 2x2 experiment we varied both audience size (large vs. small) and information intimacy (personal vs. non-personal). We used recognition tests for the association of audience and disclosed information to assess memory performance. Results show that item memory (the memory for what information has been disclosed) exceeded target memory and that target memory improved in vulnerable situations (for large audiences and personal information).

Our results suggest that, under normal intellectual functioning, memory search in old age (69–84 years) is consistent with a dynamic process that switches between retrieval probes. With dementia and very old age (85–103 years), however, memory search seems to become more consistent with a static process that activates items in memory as a function of their frequency. The weight that probes have in determining the activation of items in memory seems to be an informative signature of the impact of healthy aging and dementia on memory search. Our results show that, with healthy aging and dementia, the activation of items in memory is increasingly more determined by the frequency of past experience with those items.",>Ana Sofia Morais>Hansjörg Neth>Thomas Hills,">Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Dept. of Psychology, University of Warwick",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0554/index.html

This result was observed only for passable apertures suggesting that social constraints may influence visual perception only when people can actually perform this action.

2013,Joint Commitment: An Analysis of Emotions and Non-Verbal Behaviors,"According to Margaret Gilbert, a joint commitment (JC) is a commitment of two or more agents, called the parties of the JC, to engage in a common project. Creating a JC often involves an explicit agreement, carried out in a conversa-tional interaction through overt communication. We ex-plored aspects of such interactions that can be considered as complementary to verbal exchanges, focusing on how a JC is managed by the parties by means of emotional and other non-verbal bodily expressions. We analyzed three phases of the JC lifecycle (creation, maintenance, and violation), and in particular the emotional reaction of the participants to two types of violations by the experimenter. In our analysis we used standardized tools such as the Ethological Coding System for Interviews, the Mind Reading Emotional Library, and the Facial Action Coding System. Our results show that certain non-verbal behaviors in the phase of JC creation are characteristic of the participants who later did not fulfill their commitment. Moreover, the participants’ emotional reactions to JC violation by the experimenter turned out to depend on the type of violation. Finally, the creation and maintenance of JC, and the emotional reaction to its violation, appear to be independent of the participants’ personality and empathic disposition.",>Francesca Morganti>Antonella Carassa>Marco Colombetti>Paride Braibanti>Giorgio Rezzonico>Ivana Sgro,>University of Bergamo>University of Lugano>University of Lugano>University of Bergamo>University of Milano-Bicocca>University of Bergamo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0556/index.html

In this study we investigate the developmental origins of this belief. We showed toddlers (24 months) a spontaneous or explained novel physical outcome (a toy that lit up either spontaneously or upon contact from an experimenter) and then showed them an additional candidate cause (pressing a button) while obscuring the outcome. We asked whether toddlers inferred that the two components (the button and the outcome) were causally linked. We found that toddlers represented the candidate cause as the cause of the novel outcome only when the event spontaneously occurred (Experiments 1-2), and that children spontaneously searched for plausible causes of unexplained outcomes (Experiment 3). These results suggest that toddlers, like older children, believe physical events have causes, and that this belief supports exploration and discovery.",>Paul Muentener>Laura Schulz,>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0557/index.html

We develop a new experimental design that allows us to test our hypotheses concurrently in both separate and joint evaluation modes using a constant procedure across groups.

This study aimed to extend this finding to the domain of social networks, in which social distance is defined by degrees of separation. A total of 334 participants responded to tasks very similar to those in Jones and Rachlin (2008), except that they were required to choose whether they would prefer to receive an amount of money for themselves only or an amount of money for themselves and a person who is n degrees of separation from them up to six degrees.

Previous research has repeatedly demonstrated that individuals' choices are not well explained by expected utility theory, and a number of alternative models have been examined using carefully selected sets of choice alternatives. The model performance however, can depend on which choice alternatives are being tested. Here we develop a non-parametric method for estimating the utility map over the wide range of choice alternatives. The estimated maps are compared against the three of the most well-known models of risky choice: expected utility theory, cumulative prospect theory, and the transfer of attention exchange model. Model comparison indicates that cumulative prospect theory provides a better prediction of individuals' choices, but the estimated maps show that the overall shape of utility map is different from what the model predicts.",>Takao Noguchi>Adam Sanborn>Neil Stewart,">University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom>University of Warwick>University of Warwick",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0561/index.html

2013,Where What You Count is What Really Counts,"We noticed that human subjects were notably faster and more accurate in concurrent counting of three location-based events while they ignored the identity of targets, compared to concurrent counting of three identity-based events while they ignored the locations. In a control experiment, subjects performed a location-based triple counting task, while now also paying attention to the target identity. This did not incur any additional cost, compared to the cost of the location-based counting. Performing each of these tasks relies on maintaining three running numerical counters, and on switching between them to increase each one. Our results suggest that switching between these counters has lower cost when they are associated to spatial locations, compared to when they are associated to identities. This difference is not affected when additionally processing the identity of items. We argue that this might be related to the advantage of the space in switching attention between internal representations.",>Nader Noori>Laurent Itti,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0563/index.html
2013,Traces of Intellectual Working Memory Tasks on Visuospatial Short-Term Memory,"We measured the sensitivity in detecting a change in the location of one of two visual targets over a short period of time to investigate the impact of a secondary intellectual symbolic WM task on the visuospatial short-term memory, in a dual-task paradigm. We observed that engaging in a WM task that involves manipulation of symbolic information impacts the ability to detect a location change, and this impact does not change when more time is allocated to the WM task. Furthermore, we observed that the impact of a mental sorting task on the ability to detect location changes is spatially selective to the horizontal orientation. Our results suggest a possible role for sensory-motor working memory, which supports perception-action schemas in manipulation of information during the intellectual symbolic working memory tasks.",>Nader Noori>Laurent Itti,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0564/index.html
2013,Measuring the comprehension of negation in 2- to 4-year-old children,"Negation is one of the most important concepts in human language, and yet little is known about children’s ability to comprehend negative sentences. In this experiment, we explore how children’s comprehension of negative sentences changes between 2- to 4-year-old children, as well as how comprehension is influenced by how negative sentences are used. Children between the ages of 2 and 4 years watched a video in which they heard positive and negative sentences. Negative sentences, such as “look at the boy with no apples”, referred either to an absence of a characteristic or an alternative characteristic. Older children showed significant improvements in speed and accuracy of looks to target. Children showed more difficulty when the negative sentence referred to nothing, compared to when it referred to an alternative. In addition, children showed an early tendency to look towards the named noun, even when that noun was negated. This study contributes to our understanding of children’s comprehension of negative sentences, as well as our understanding of the conceptual structure of negation.",>Ann Nordmeyer>Michael Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0565/index.html
2013,Limitations and chances of working memory training,"Recent studies show controversial results on the trainability of working memory (WM) capacity being a limiting factor of human cognition. In order to contribute to this open question we investigated if participants improve in trained tasks and whether gains generalize to untrained WM tasks, mathematical problem solving and intelligence tests. 83 adults trained over a three week period (7.5 hours total) in one of the following conditions: A high, a medium or a low WM load group. The present findings show that task specific characteristics could be learned but that there was no transfer between trained and untrained tasks which had no common elements. Positive transfer occurred between two tasks focusing on inhibitory processes. It might be possible to enhance this specific component of WM but not WM capacity as such. A possible enhancement in a learning test is of high educational interest and worthwhile to be investigated further.",>Daniela Nussbaumer>Roland H.

2013,The synergy of top-down and bottom-up attention in complex task: going beyond saliency models.,"This paper studies how visual perception of a scene is affected by cognitive processes beyond the scene's bottom-up saliency. The game of SET is taken as an example where contrast-based salient parts of a scene are ignored in favor of a larger group of similar elements. Using results from a laboratory experiment and a model simulation we explain how three cognitive mechanisms, differential acuity, visual iconic memory and declarative retrieval, considered together help to explain player's visual perception in SET.",>Enkhbold Nyamsuren>Niels Taatgen,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0567/index.html
2013,Is Facial Expression Processing Holistic?,"Most studies examine holistic processing with respect to facial identity, but at least one study has also looked at holistic processing of facial expressions (Calder, Young, Keane, & Dean, 2000). However, this work used the partial composite paradigm, which is known to exhibit bias effects (Richler, Cheung, & Gauthier, 2011). The complete composite paradigm (Gauthier & Bukach, 2007) provides a bias-proof way to quantitatively measure holistic processing. In this paper, we perform the corresponding experiment in our face processing model (EMPATH, (Dailey, Cottrell, Padgett, & Adolphs, 2002)) to predict whether holistic processing of facial expressions will be found if the corresponding human experiments are performed, and our prediction is that it will. We also compared our model’s performance to the participants in recent experiments in facial expression recognition in humans (Tanaka, Kaiser, Butler, & Le Grand, 2012). Tanaka et al. (2012) concluded that expression recognition is not always holistic, but our results suggest that it is.",>Akinyinka Omigbodun>Garrison Cottrell,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0568/index.html
2013,Discovering Pronoun Categories using Discourse Information,"Interpretation of a pronoun is driven by properties of syntactic distribution. Consequently, acquiring the meaning and the distribution are intertwined. In order to learn that a pronoun is reflexive, learners need to know which entity the pronoun refers to in a sentence, but in order to infer its referent they need to know that the pronoun is reflexive. This study examines whether discourse information is the information source that the learner might use to acquire grammatical categories of pronouns. Experimental results demonstrate that adults can use discourse information to accurately guess the referents of pronouns. Simulations show that a Bayesian model using guesses from the experiment as an estimate of the discourse information successfully categorizes English pronouns into categories corresponding to reflexives and non-reflexives. Together, these results suggest that knowing which entities are likely to be referred to in the discourse can help learners acquire grammatical categories of pronouns.",>Naho Orita>Rebecca McKeown>Naomi Feldman>Jeffrey Lidz>Jordan Boyd-Graber,>University of Maryland>University of Maryland>University of Maryland>University of Maryland>University of Maryland,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0569/index.html
2013,Constraints on Theories of Serial Order Memory Revisited: The Cases of the Fill-In and Protrusion Effects,"In his seminal dissertation, Henson (1996) identified a number of constraints on theories of serial order memory. Two constraints, the fill-in constraint, in which an item that is erroneously recalled early is likely to be followed by its predecessor rather than its successor (recall of ACB is more likely than ACD), and the protrusion constraint, in which prior list intrusions are likely to be recalled in the same output position as their previous serial position, were considered evidence against chaining theories. We present results from two experiments which investigate the extent to which these effects are dependent on experimental methodology. When participants are given an open set of items, an equal ratio of fill-in and in-fill errors was observed and a protrusion effect was obtained. However, when a reconstruction of order task was used, a fill-in effect was observed. Implications for theories of serial order memory are discussed.",>Adam Osth>Simon Dennis,>The Ohio-State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0570/index.html
2013,Modeling Gain-Loss Asymmetries in Risky Choice: The Critical Role of Probability Weighting,"A robust empirical regularity in decision making is that the negative consequences of an option (i.e., losses) often have a stronger impact on people’s behavior than the positive consequences (i.e., gains). One common explanation for such a gain-loss asymmetry is loss aversion. To model loss aversion in risky decisions, prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) assumes a kinked value function (which translates objective consequences into subjective utilities), with a steeper curvature for losses than for gains. We highlight, however, that the prospect theory framework offers many alternative ways to model gain-loss asymmetries (e.g., via the weighting function, which translates objective probabilities into subjective decision weights; or via the choice rule). Our goal is to systematically test these alternative models against each other. In a reanalysis of data by Glöckner and Pachur (2012), we show that people’s risky decisions are best accounted for by a version of prospect theory that has a more elevated weighting function for losses than for gains but the same value function for both domains. These results contradict the common assumption that a kinked value function is necessary to model risky choices and point to the neglected role of people’s differential probability weighting in the gain and loss domains.",>Thorsten Pachur>David Kellen,">Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Center for Adaptive Rationality>University of Freiburg",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0571/index.html
2013,Semantic Implicit Learning in Language,"Previous studies of semantic implicit learning in language have only examined learning grammatical form-meaning connections where learning could have been supported by prior linguistic knowledge. Also, these studies assessed awareness by verbal report, which is arguably not the most reliable measure. Here we target the domain of verb meaning, specifically semantic preferences of novel verbs (e.g. a novel verb takes abstract objects). Using a reaction time methodology we show that after exposure to correct verb-noun combinations, reaction times to incorrect combinations are slowed down even for participants who are unaware of the semantic regularity. This effect was also obtained even when the semantic regularity was irrelevant to the tasks being performed, suggesting that the semantic generalisation is learned and exerts its influence automatically, hence satisfying one criterion for implicitness. Combined with a lack of verbalisable knowledge in any participant these experiments provide strong evidence for semantic implicit learning in language.",>Albertyna Paciorek>John Williams,>University of Cambridge>University of Cambridge,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0572/index.html
2013,The role of verbal labels in attention to dimensional similarity,"In general, young children focus on holistic similarity and older children focus on dimensional similarity (selectively attending to one property, such as brightness, to the exclusion of others, such as size). Research on early word learning, however, suggests the process of learning words trains attention to category-relevant dimensions. We ask: does word learning scaffold dimensional attention more generally? By showing labels support dimensional attention, these results clarify the processes involved in similarity perception and unify our understanding of attentional processes in word learning with those in a broader context.",>Lynn Perry>Larissa Samuelson,>University of Wisconsin-Madison>University of Iowa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0573/index.html
2013,A category theory perspective on compositionality and (the development of) cognitive capacity,"A remarkable property of human cognition is the systematic co-occurrence of certain cognitive abilities. One challenge for cognitive science is to determine the (computational) principles that derive this property as part of a broader goal of establishing the foundations of cognitive architecture (i.e. the basic processes and modes of combination affording cognitive capacity) for a science of cognition. This paper continues a category theory approach to compositionality and cognitive capacity that posits universal construction (e.g., products) as a fundamental cognitive architectural component. As shown here, products can be modeled in other frameworks, thereby providing a link between an abstract computational principle and a concrete cognitive resource needed for particular capacities. For example, a network of weighted connections implementing a categorical product uses fewer resources when the number of task instances sharing a common product structure is greater than two; otherwise it is more economic to realize each instance independently. This cross-over may explain why human cognition is not always systematic: the cost of universal construction may not outweigh its expected gain.",>Steven Phillips,>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0574/index.html
2013,Spontaneous Analogy by Piggybacking on a Perceptual System,"Most computational models of analogy assume they are given a delineated source domain and often a specified target domain. These systems do not address how analogs can be isolated from large domains and spontaneously retrieved from long-term memory, a process we call spontaneous analogy. We present a system that represents relational structures as feature bags. Using this representation, our system leverages perceptual algorithms to automatically create an ontology of relational structures and to efficiently retrieve analogs for new relational structures from long-term memory. We provide a demonstration of our approach that takes a set of unsegmented stories, constructs an ontology of analogical schemas (corresponding to plot devices), and uses this ontology to efficiently find analogs within new stories, yielding significant time-savings over linear analog retrieval at a small accuracy cost.",>Marc Pickett>David Aha,>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0575/index.html

In this talk, I sketch a theory of conceptual representation that places this dual function of concepts at its core. The theory is shown to provide a natural way of capturing four key characteristics of the ways in which we think about kinds and instances of kinds. These characteristics are not accounted for by standard approaches to conceptual representation. In the final section of the paper, I consider how the phenomena discussed in this paper may be accommodated by current approaches to conceptual representation.",>Sandeep Prasada,">Hunter College, CUNY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0576/index.html
2013,Category Change in the Absence of Falsifying Feedback,"Many conceptual change theories posit that change occurs when the learner becomes dissatisfied with the current conception (Ohlsson, 2011; Strike & Posner, 1992). A necessary component of dissatisfaction is falsifying feedback. The present experiments investigate whether participants exposed to a novel method for eliminating the ability to directly falsify a misconception will still be able to recategorize compared to participants that can directly falsify. The results suggest that direct falsification of a misconception is not necessary for recategorization, and that direct falsification may slow the learning process.

We identify a common information structure in the name grammars of the world’s languages, which makes this complex information processing task manageable, and evaluate the impact that the re-engineering of naming practices for legal and political purposes has had on the communicative and psychological properties of these socially evolved systems. While East-Asian naming systems have been largely unaffected by state legislation, legal interference has transformed Western naming practices, making individual names harder to process and remember. Further, the structural collapse of Western naming systems has not affected all parts of society equally: In the US, it has had a disproportionate impact on those sections of society that are least successful in economic and social terms. We consider the implications of these changes for name memory across the lifespan, and for future naming practices.",>Michael Ramscar>Asha Halima Smith>Melody Dye>Richard Futrell>Peter Hendrix>Harald Baayen>Rebecca Starr,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>Stanford University>Indiana University>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0578/index.html

2013,Reduced neural sensitivity to online social interactions in autism,"Difficulty with social interactions is a hallmark characteristic of autism spectrum disorders. While many studies have investigated the neural mechanisms underlying atypical social cognition, the methods used have rarely involved social interaction, relying instead on offline reasoning about a character. In the current study, we examined whether and which brain systems are sensitive to online social interactions in individuals with autism. We compared functional MRI data collected from 15 neurotypical (NT) and 15 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participants during live real-time interactions (Live) and during a video replay of the same interaction (Recorded-Same) and a novel interaction (Recorded-Novel). Whole brain analyses demonstrated a significantly greater response to Live than Recorded conditions, in NT vs ASD, within left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and regions of the cerebellum bilaterally. Region of interest analyses revealed that right posterior temporal regions were differentially recruited during online social interactions in the ASD and NT groups. Also, regions commonly associated with personal salience (i.e., dorsal anterior cingulate and bilateral insula) were sensitive to online social interactions in NT, but to novelty in the ASD group. These data suggest reduced and atypical neural sensitivity to online social interactions in individuals with autism.",>Elizabeth Redcay>Rebecca Saxe,">University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0581/index.html
2013,"Smooth Dynamics, Good Performance in Cognitive-Agent Congestion Problems","In a congestion game, individuals exhaust a common resource out of selfish behavior. In this scenario, drivers create traffic jams by choosing the shortest route according to their individual knowledge. They can avoid them by communicating their belief states about the traffic situation in real-time through a peer-to-peer network, assuming unlimited bandwidth. We study two potential, cognitively inspired models of human behavior: 1) categorization (quantized memorization and communication), which dampens communication and belief adoption, but leads to undesired oscillations and lower performance. 2) Instance-based blending with memory decay, which achieves good dynamics and near-optimal performance without the same bandwidth needs.

2013,"Application of the Category Adjustment Model in Temporal, Spatial, and Abstract Magnitude at the Billions Scale","The current study examines the generalization of the Category Adjustment Model (CAM) across scales along two dimensions: time and distance. Participants were presented with geologic time and astronomical distance information either conventionally or using the hierarchical alignment model. Participants provided with hierarchically structured magnitude information for time and distances were more accurate on similar estimations at large scales than participants given the same content in a conventional manner. Patterns in event and distance estimation, along with overall group differences, are consistent with the CAM; suggesting people use hierarchically organized categorical information when estimating across scales and dimensions, and providing salient category boundary information improves estimation. Findings suggest a common representation of scale information for temporal, spatial, and abstract (numeric) magnitudes. Patterns of abstract magnitude estimations are consistent with segmented linear models of scale representation. Implications of the CAM in scale representation and the hierarchical alignment model in education are discussed.",>Ilyse Resnick>Thomas F.

2013,English Words Are Processed Like Objects,"This experiment sought to explore the theory that familiar English words are processed similarly to objects. To do this, we looked for object-based attentional facilitation where cues in a different location to the target still facilitate target detection as long as they are inside the same object. Participants were shown two English words in an array, and cues and targets were embedded inside them. Reaction times for target detection were measured. It was found that in horizontally presented English words, cues presented in a different location to the target still facilitated target detection if they occurred inside the same word. This was not the case for vertically oriented words. It was concluded that familiar words in a familiar orientation are indeed processed in a similar way to objects. These findings may be indicative that the cortical networks that evolved for object processing are also involved in the processing of words.",>Gavin Revie>Yuki Kamide,">University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom>University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0584/index.html

Under this premise, this paper proposes a novel modification of the standard SOM algorithm in the form of an oscillating Topological Neighborhood (TN) width function. Existing research in neuroscience indicates that SOMs with oscillating TN width could exhibit higher biological plausibility than standard TN width SOMs. In this paper, two neuro-developmental disorders, autism and schizophrenia, are modeled, based on existing neurocomputational theories, using both SOM approaches. The simulation results demonstrate that there is significant equivalence between standard and oscillating TN width SOM modeling in terms of map formation behavior, output and structure.

2013,The Language of Everyday Verbal Analogies,"Verbal analogies produced during naturally occurring instructional discourse in mathematics were explored using techniques borrowed from studies of language in use (see Wortham & Rymes, 2003). Close examination of two eighth-grade instructional analogies reveals that the language practices of analogy are instrumental in shaping recipients’ relational re-representation of objects being compared, in particular through markers of indexicality and poetic parallel structure. At the same time, close examination of the communicative interactions reveals that these devices may reduce the burden on recipients’ reasoning to the point that they may appear successful at solving the verbal analogy, but their responses can be explained by facility in verbal interaction rather than in mathematical reasoning. These data provide thereby new insights into the “analogical paradox,” the finding that analogies are commonly successful as vehicles for interactionally producing and displaying understanding of new information in everyday contexts but generally problematic when measured for their effects on reasoning in controlled laboratory settings (Dunbar, 1998). We identify a tension between interactional and cognitive success of everyday communicative analogies, meaning that those that are most likely to be interactionally successful may lead to less cognitive engagement for analogy recipients.",>Lindsey Richland>Justin Richland,>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0586/index.html

Two hypotheses have been suggested. The first is that combinatoriality is a necessary solution to the problem of conveying a large number of meanings; the sec- ond is that it arises as a consequence of conventionalisation.

2013,From Minor Mishap to Major Catastrophe: Lexical Choice in Miscommunication,"Miscommunication is often regarded as noise or uninformative in psycholinguistic research. However, Coupland et al. (1991) suggest that miscommunication can provide rich information about how interlocutors come to communicate successfully. Successful communication necessarily needs the individuals involved to coordinate and update their mutual knowledge, experiences, beliefs, and assumptions. However, the process of updating this information may be ridden with unsuccessful attempts that eventually help interlocutors reach a common goal. This study evaluates the relative contribution of linguistic factors to communicative success, based on verbal grounding (e.g., mutual agreement on a referent) and visual congruency (e.g., interlocutor’s visual environments match or mismatch) during a collaborative task. We show that varying levels of communicative success are laden with rich linguistic information that may uncover interesting aspects of successful and less successful communication.",>Jennifer Roche>Alexandra Paxton>Alyssa Ibarra>Michael Tanenhaus,">University of Rochester>University of California, Merced>University of Rochester>University of Rochester",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0588/index.html
2013,Effects of Target Size and Symmetry on the Structure of Variability in Precision Aiming,"The current experiment investigated the effects of target size and symmetry on the dynamics of precision aiming. Participants were asked to sit on a chair and point at the center of four different targets (a small and big square target, and a horizontal and vertical rectangular target). The aiming movements were assessed using linear (root mean square) and non-linear fractal statistics (DFA and MFDFA). We found that participants spontaneously exhibited more movement in target dimensions with less spatial constraint (i.e., larger target dimensions). These larger movements, however, were more deterministic than the movements accompanying the smaller targets, indicating that more variation in aiming does not necessarily mean more random. Finally, even though participants’ movements were multifractal, the different manipulations and task constraints had no effect on the width of the multifractal spectrum. These results suggest that human performance emerges from the complex relationship and interactions that exist between the perception and action capabilities of the human body and the physical environment.",>Veronica Romero>Charles A.

2013,The influence of perceptual and structural salience,"Spatial cognition research has recently made much progress in understanding the cognitive representations and processes underlying human wayfinding. Many theoretical assumptions about the concept of landmark salience have been established. In this context it is important to define perceptual (or visual) and structural landmark salience. Structural salience is defined as the position of a landmark at an intersection. Perceptual salience is defined as the visual characteristic of a landmark. It must “stand out” from its surrounding to be perceptually salient. We investigated the influence of perceptual salience and the combination of perceptual and structural salience in landmark selection. We show for a spatial arrangement of four objects that the different object is preferred almost always. If the same spatial arrangement is interpreted as an intersection with a directional information, the participants’ preference is influenced by structural as well as perceptual salience. Findings are discussed within the context of landmark salience.",>Florian Röser>Antje Krumnack>Kai Hamburger,">Justus Liebig University, Giessen; Experimenlat Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University, Giessen; Experimenlat Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University, Giessen; Experimenlat Psychology and Cognitive Science",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0590/index.html
2013,Development of Substitution Bias Sensitivity: Are Adolescents Happy Fools?,"Influential work on human thinking suggests that our judgment is often biased because we minimize cognitive effort and intuitively substitute hard questions by easier ones. Recent work with adults who solved the bat-and-ball problem, one of the most publicized examples of the substitution bias, suggests that people realize they are doing this and notice their mistake. In the present paper we look at the development of this substitution bias sensitivity. A group of young adolescents solved standard and isomorphic control versions of the bat-and-ball problem in which reasoners experience no intuitive pull to substitute. Adults have been shown to be less confident in their substituted, erroneous bat-and-ball answer than in their answer on the control version that does not give rise to the substitution. However, the present study established that this critical confidence drop was less pronounced for young adolescents. This implies that in contrast with adults, young adolescents do not yet fully acknowledge the questionable nature of their biased answer and remain more oblivious to the substitution. That is, young adolescent reasoners seem to behave more like happy fools who blindly answer erroneous questions without realizing it.",>Sandrine Rossi>Mathieu Cassotti>Marine Agogué>Wim De Neys,>University of Caen>Paris Descartes University>Mines ParisTech>Paris Descartes University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0591/index.html
2013,Even if after If then conditionals,"This study evaluates how people represent “even if” conditionals when they have to integrate them with previous “if then” conditionals and also make an inference. The terms in the premises were ordered to facilitate their integration (Figure 1: If A then B; Even if B C). In half the cases, the “even if” conditional was expressed with a negation instead of an affirmation (If A then B; Even if not B C). Participants had to infer what followed, given A or C. Previous results showed that in comprehension tasks, where information had to be integrated, counterfactual conditionals seemed to be represented with just one situation (B and C). By contrast, when people had to make inferences with these conditionals, they seemed to represent two situations. In any case, counterfactual seem to be represented with two situations (B and C, and not B and C). In our task, people had to do both: to infer and to integrate. Results showed that the use of negations and the direction in the inference had an effect on the endorsed inferences, but the two factors did not interact. The need to integrate premises did not block access to the two “even if” situations in an inference task",>José A.

However, only few PDP models have attempted to model more brain-related data like event related potentials (ERPs). In this paper, we take a step towards using ERP data for model fitting by proposing a PDP model, which can successfully replicate various known ERP effects. Specifically, we introduce a PDP-equivalent of the N400 ERP measure and apply it to a simple PDP model of early bilingual word acquisition as bilingual word acquisition tasks provide several well-established N400 effects that can be used for model validation. We then analyze the dynamics of the network to show why and how the network can capture each of the targeted N400 effects.

2013,Interpreting Covariation in Causal Structure Learning,"Recent studies have shown that people use covariation information to infer causal structure. However, there is little information about how people derive causal directionality from covariation. The present study is designed to provide further evidence about the role of covariation in causal structure learning. In Experiment 1, where covariation between two variables was systematically manipulated, participants were asked to observe the states of bacteria (present or absent) and to infer their causal relationship. We found that judgments of causal structure varied as a function of covariation, and that participants interpreted covariation according to necessity of causation. In Experiment 2, participants who received information about high causal strength interpreted covariation according to sufficiency of causation. These results demonstrate that prior knowledge modulates interpretation of covariation and suggest that domain-general covariation information and domain-specific prior knowledge of causal relations interact in causal structure learning.",>Motoyuki Saito>Tsuneo Shimazaki,>Kwansei Gakuin University>Kwansei Gakuin University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0596/index.html
2013,The Rich Who Have the Humility of the Poor: Effects of Culture and Power on Altruism,"In this paper we investigate the effect of power on prosocial decision-making. While previous research has thoroughly investigated this relation in Western cultures, we focus our research on the role of power in an understudied Middle-Eastern culture. Existing literature suggest an inverse relationship between feeling of power and prosocial behavior, where generally people in high levels of power tend to act less sympathetically in their decisions and demonstrate declined levels of perspective taking towards others. Our findings demonstrate that, unlike their Western counterparts, Iranian participants show significantly higher levels of altruism when in a high-power situation perceived as legitimate. On the other hand, under illegitimate power conditions, participants primed with high-power act significantly less compassionately in comparison to their low-power counterparts. We believe these findings have great impact in studying social hierarchies and behavior in cross-cultural settings.",>Niloufar Salehi>Morteza Dehghani,>Sharif University of Technology>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0597/index.html
2013,Intonation and positional effects in spoken serial recall,"Past studies have indicated that intonation, in the sense of fundamental frequency modulation, can only enhance serial recall to the extent that it can induce a grouping effect, something that can also be induced by a simple insertion of pauses. However, in a study of spoken serial recall of nine-digit lists, we are able to show that recall is significantly better when sequences of digits are marked by specific intonation contours than when they are simply grouped by silent pauses in the signal. Thus, we found that intonation plays a role during the encoding phase, whereby items in group-final positions draw particular benefit from intonation. However, intonation does not appear to play the same role in the retrieval phase, since when subjects are instructed to imitate intonation during recall, performance shows mixed effects.",>Michelina Savino>Andrea Bosco>Martine Grice,">University of Bari, Italy>University of Bari, Italy>University of Cologne, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0598/index.html
2013,Is Double-Dipping an Alternative to Double-Dissociation?: Sampling Two Representational Systems Using a Single Task,"Dual-process models of categorization posit dissociable implicit and explicit category learning systems. Evidence in favour of these accounts is typically obtained by examining how categorization responses differ over time, with differing category structures, and by changing task demands. If these two categorization systems are activated concurrently (e.g., COVIS) then both implicit and explicit representations can be examined over the course of learning even when one system dominates category response selection. In the current study, we used subjective measures of performance (i.e., confidence reports) to continuously sample from a participant’s explicit representation of the category structure while also examining changes in these reports over the course of training. Using category structures that motivate the acquisition of either explicit or implicit representations, we observed differences in confidence reports that did not correspond to changes in categorization accuracy. These findings provide evidence for categorization systems that contain different representations.",>Jordan Richard Schoenherr>Guy Lacroix,>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0599/index.html
2013,Match Me if You Can: How Smart Choices are Fueled by Competition,"In a world of limited resources, scarcity and rivalry are central challenges for decision makers. We examine choice behavior in competitive probability learning environments that reinforce one of two strategies. The optimality of a strategy is dependent on the behavior of a computerized opponent: if the opponent mimics participant choices, probability matching is optimal; if the opponent is indifferent, probability maximizing is optimal. We observed accurate asymptotic strategy use in both conditions suggesting participants were sensitive to the differences in opponent behavior. Moreover, the results emphasize that ‘irrational’ probability matching can be adaptive once such competitive pressures are taken into account. The application of reinforcement learning models to the data suggests that computational conceptualizations of opponent behavior are critical to account for the observed divergence in strategy adoption.",>Christin Schulze>Don van Ravenzwaaij>Ben R.

2013,Infant contributions to joint attention predict vocabulary development,"Joint attention has long been accepted as constituting a privileged circumstance in which word learning prospers. Consequently research has investigated the role that maternal responsiveness to infant attention plays in predicting language outcomes. However there has been a recent expansion in research implicating similar predictive effects from individual differences in infant behaviours. Emerging from the foundations of such work comes an interesting question: do the relative contributions of the mother and infant to joint attention episodes impact upon language learning? In an attempt to address this, two joint attention behaviours were assessed as predictors of vocabulary attainment (as measured by OCDI Production Scores). These predictors were: mothers encouraging attention to an object given their infant was already attending to an object (maternal follow-in); and infants looking to an object given their mothers encouragement of attention to an object (infant follow-in). In a sample of 14-month old children (N=36) we compared the predictive power of these maternal and infant follow-in variables on concurrent and later language performance. Results using Growth Curve Analysis provided evidence that while both maternal follow-in and infant follow-in variables contributed to production scores, infant follow-in was a stronger predictor. Consequently it does appear to matter whose final contribution establishes joint attention episodes. Infants who more often follow-in into their mothers’ encouragement of attention have larger, and faster growing vocabularies between 14 and 18-months of age.",>Katherine Scott>Elena Sakkalou>Kate Ellis-Davies>Elma Hilbrink>Ulrike Hahn>Merideth Gattis,">Cardiff University, Cardiff, Cardiff, United Kingdom>Cardiff University, Cardiff, Cardiff, United Kingdom>Cardiff University, Cardiff, Cardiff, United Kingdom>Cardiff University, Cardiff, Cardiff, United Kingdom>Birkbeck>Cardiff University, Cardiff, Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0602/index.html
2013,"Intentionality, Evaluative Judgments, and Causal Structure","The results from a number of recent studies suggest that ascriptions of intentionality are based on evaluative considerations: specifically, that the likelihood of viewing a person’s actions as intentional is greater when the outcome is bad than good (see Knobe, 2006, 2010). In this research we provide an alternative explanation for these findings, one based on the idea that ascriptions of intentionality depend on causal structure. As predicted by the causal structure view, we observed that actions leading to bad outcomes are associated with negative social pressures (Experiment 1), that these negative pressures give rise to a specific kind of causal structure (Experiment 2), and that when these causal structures are pitted against the badness of the outcome, intentionality judgments track with causal structure and not badness (Experiment 3). While the badness of an outcome may have an indirect effect on judgments of intentionality, our results suggest that the factors that affect judgments of intentionality most directly are non-evaluative and objective.",>Jason Shepard>Phillip Wolff,">Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States>Emory University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0603/index.html

In the current research, we investigate whether infants are truly sensitive to coincidences, detecting these events even when they cannot be predicted mere probabilities. In addition, we explore whether this sensitivity is translated into action, encouraging infants to engage in activities that enable them to revise their theories. Results from 2 experiments demonstrate that infants display a sensitivity to coincidence similar to adult intuitions, and they selectively explore objects that produce anomalous data that better supports an alternative theory than their prior theory.",>Zi Sim>Fei Xu,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0605/index.html
2013,Exploring the Developmental Feedback Loop: Word Learning in Neural Networks and Toddlers,"Early word learning may be supported by a developmental feedback loop: the kind of words a child learns early on support the development of attentional biases, which in turn facilitate further word learning. In neural network simulations and a longitudinal study of toddlers we investigated how the emergence of an attentional bias to shape in word learning impacts vocabulary growth with respect to different kinds of words. If this relationship is causal, we should see that the emergence of a shape bias leads to an increase in the rate of learning of shape-based words relative to other kinds of words. The networks supported this prediction, showing an acceleration of shape- compared to material-based word learning. However, in toddlers, shape- and material-based words were learned similarly around the shape bias emergence. Implications are discussed for the developmental feedback loop account and causal relationships between attentional bias development and vocabulary growth.",>Clare Sims>Savannah Schilling>Eliana Colunga,">University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States>University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States>University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0606/index.html

Evidence indicating that these two processes are shared conflicts with other results suggesting that they are largely distinct. These conflicting findings suggest that musical and linguistic processing may share some, but not all, underlying processes, raising the question of what exactly those shared processes might be. Two experiments tested the idea that one shared process is cognitive control by pairing manipulations of musical structure with the Stroop task, a standard test of cognitive control. Manipulations of harmonic expectancy, but not of timbral expectancy, interacted with Stroop interference effects, suggesting that cognitive control is at least one specific process underlying shared syntactic processing in music and language.",>L.

2013,Modelling the Effects of Formal Literacy Training on Language Mediated Visual Attention,"Recent empirical evidence suggests that language-mediated eye gaze is partly determined by level of formal literacy training. Huettig, Singh and Mishra (2011) showed that high-literate individuals' eye gaze was closely time locked to phonological overlap between a spoken target word and items presented in a visual display. In contrast, low-literate individuals' eye gaze was not related to phonological overlap, but was instead strongly influenced by semantic relationships between items. Our present study tests the hypothesis that this behavior is an emergent property of an increased ability to extract phonological structure from the speech signal, as in the case of high-literates, with low-literates more reliant on more coarse grained structure. This hypothesis was tested using a neural network model, that integrates linguistic information extracted from the speech signal with visual and semantic information within a central resource. We demonstrate that contrasts in fixation behavior similar to those observed between high and low literates emerge when models are trained on speech signals of contrasting granularity.",>Alastair Smith>Padraic Monaghan>Falk Huettig,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0608/index.html

Here we investigate the causes of this tension, suggesting that prediction is based on real physics, but explanation is susceptible to biases. We gave participants three tasks based on the same physical principles: two prediction tasks and one task that required drawing the future path of motion. We found distinct biases in all three tasks; however, the two prediction tasks could be explained by consistent application of real physical principles under uncertainty, while the drawing task produced many more idiosyncratic biases.

2013,Hear No Evil: Can Music Attenuate the Irrelevant Speech Effect?,"This study aims to replicate the irrelevant speech effect (ISE) in a local context and, more important, is the first to directly investigate if musical information can reduce impairments imposed by the ISE on a serial word recall task. Thirty-five undergraduates from the National University of Singapore performed serial recall on 10 word lists. The lists were presented under 5 auditory conditions, namely: Music-Only, Combined (music with background speech), Scrambled music with background speech, Background Speech-Only and White Noise conditions. The Scrambled condition contained the same piece of music as the Combined condition except that it was re-arranged in a random fashion; the mission of this condition was to specifically provide a comparison basis to test if “musical structure” per se actually attenuates the ISE. A significant main effect of music conditions emerged. ISE was successfully replicated, where a significantly lower percentage of correct words was recalled in the Background Speech-Only condition compared to all other conditions. ISE was also successfully attenuated, but the present data suggest that musical structure per se was not (at least not entirely) responsible for the attenuation, since the Scrambled condition had superior performance than both the Combined and Background Speech-Only conditions. Here, we propose and discuss several novel theoretical models involving changing acoustical features, selective attention, and arousal to account for the present findings.",>Wei Jie Soh>Stephen Wee Hun Lim,>National University of Singapore>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0610/index.html
2013,Priming randomness increases the evaluation of ritual efficacy,"Reestablishing feelings of control in the face of uncertainty is a fundamental motive for human behavior. We propose that rituals (i.e., socially stipulated, causally opaque practices) provide a means for coping with the aversive feelings associated with randomness due to the perception of a connection between ritual action and a desired outcome. Two experiments were conducted (one in Brazil [$N=40$] and another in the U.S. [$N=94$]) to evaluate how the perceived efficacy of rituals is affected by feelings of randomness. In a between-subjects design, the Scramble Sentence Task was used as a priming procedure in three conditions (i.e., randomness, negativity, and neutral) and participants were then asked to rate the efficacy of rituals used for problem-solving purposes. The results demonstrate that priming randomness increased participants’ perception of ritual efficacy relative to negativity and neutral conditions.

Secondary school students read partly conflicting information about a medical topic, which was either presented in one single document or in four different documents, and which was purportedly authored by lay or expert sources. Results show that readers deemed deficits in source expertise (source explanations) more likely to account for conflicts in information written by lay authors than for conflicts reported by experts. In addition, conflicts presented by experts and conflicts in multiple documents were explained more strongly by referring to the nature of knowledge and knowledge production (epistemic explanations).

We suggest that in performing this task speakers perseverate on articulatory gestures comprising the form they know, and that gestures vary in the extent to which speakers perseverate on them.

We apply this to a simplified version of our large-scale functional brain model “Spaun”, where input is a 28x28 pixel visual stimulus, with a different pattern for each word. Output controls a simulated arm, giving hand-written answers. Cortical areas for categorizing, storing, and interpreting information are controlled by the basal ganglia (action selection) and thalamus (routing). The final model has ~100,000 LIF spiking neurons. We show that the model is extremely robust to neural damage (40% of neurons can be destroyed before performance drops significantly). Performance also drops for visual display times less than 250ms. Importantly, the system also scales to large vocabularies (~100,000 nouns and verbs) without requiring an exponentially large number of neurons.",>Terrence Stewart>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0615/index.html

Additionally this article also offers the following novel notions for temporal cognition: a mental time line where past/anteriority and future/posteriority have become nondispersible; dual temporal direct viewings at the present moment; and looking into the future from the past (rather than the more typical looking into the future from the present moment).

This ongoing debate, however, has been studied with visual search tasks, which seemed to produce residual laterality effects. The present study assessed whether a delayed discrimination task with divided visual field method, rather than visual search tasks, yields lateralized or bilateral categorical perception of color. The results showed an advantage for between-category discrimination relative to within-category discrimination. Such an advantage, importantly, was obtained in the left visual field as well as in the right visual field. These results suggest categorical perception of color is bilateral and not lateralized. Combining recent studies with visual search tasks (e.g., Witzel & Gegenfurtner, 2011), our results would provide further evidence for bilateral categorical perception, and thus throw doubt on the laterality effects of categorical perception.",>Takashi Suegami>Bruno Laeng>Samira Aminihajibashi,">University of Oslo, Norway>University of Oslo, Norway>University of Oslo, Norway",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0618/index.html

We argue that this paradox is resolved by appealing to the phonetics of the overall word. In two phoneme categorization studies, we examined the categorization of the initial sounds of words that contain either tap or [t]. Listeners identified the initial sound of items along a voiced-voiceless continuum (e,g, bottom–pottom, produced with word-medial [t] or tap). No preference for word-forming responses for either variant was found. But, a bias toward voiced responses for words with [t] was found. We suggest this reflects a categorization bias dependent on speaking style, and claim that the difference in responses to words with different variants is best attributed to the phonetic composition of the word, not to a particular pronunciation variant.",>Meghan Sumner>Chigusa Kurumada>Roey Gafter>Marisa Casillas,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0619/index.html

In a collaborative crossword game, two individuals solved puzzle questions either alone or collaboratively through discussion. When talking, participants solved more puzzle questions, solved them more quickly and accurately, and in general seemed to recall the words from collaborative contexts better than from matched independent contexts. By extracting the audio of their interaction, we also demonstrate interesting relationships between spoken interaction and performance on the collaborative tasks.

This is an early version of a process model intended to predict and explain multiple classes of procedural error a priori. We begin with postcompletion error (PCE), a type of systematic procedural error that people are prone to commit when there is one step to perform after they have accomplished their main task goal. Participants in an experiment demonstrated increased PCE rates following an interruption in a realistic form-filling task.

Then, they learned another hyperset, in which each set was vertically mirrored, horizontally mirrored, or randomly generated. Even when the participants did not notice the mirrored rule, the mirrored hypersets led to implicit transfer in terms of accuracy for both vertical and horizontal reversals. Furthermore, the vertical reserval also led to implicit transfer of performance speed.

In Experiment 1, participants learned Chinese characters and their English translations, performed a memorization test, and were asked to generalize their learning to the corresponding characters written in the other script. In Experiment 2, we removed the training phase and modified the tests to examine transfer based purely on perceptual similarities between simplified and traditional characters. We found the simple advantage in both experiments. Training with simplified characters produced better generalization than training with traditional characters, both when generalization relied on recognition memory and on pure perceptual similarities.

2013,Searching Semantic Memory as a Scale-Free Network: Evidence from Category Recall and a Wikipedia Model of Semantics,"How is semantic memory structured and searched? Recalling items from semantic categories is a classic assay of semantic memory, and recall dynamics tend to exhibit semantic and temporal clustering, as if memory items are organized and retrieved in clusters. Recent analyses show this clustering to be approximately scale-free in terms of distributions of inter-retrieval intervals (IRIs). This finding is replicated and extended in the present study by asking participants to type as many animals as they can recall from semantic memory. To begin to explain these results, the organization of semantic memory is modeled as a network based on Wikipedia entries for nearly 6,000 animals.

2013,Constraining Bayesian Inference with Cognitive Architectures: An Updated Associative Learning Mechanism in ACT-R,"Bayesian inference has been shown to be an efficient mechanism for describing models of learning; however, concerns over a lack of constraint in Bayesian models (e.g., Jones & Love, 2011) has limited their influence as being a description of the ‘real’ processes of human cognition. In this paper, we review some of these concerns and argue that cognitive architectures can address these concerns by constraining the hypothesis space of Bayesian models and providing a biologically-plausible mechanism for setting priors and performing inference. This is done in the context of the ACT-R functional cognitive architecture (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998), whose sub-symbolic information processing is essentially Bayesian. To that end, our focus in this paper is on an updated associative learning mechanism for ACT-R that implements the constraints of Hebbian-inspired learning in a Bayesian-compatible framework.",>Robert Thomson>Christian Lebiere,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0628/index.html
2013,A New Way of Linking Information Theory with Cognitive Science,"The relationship between the notion of *information* in information theory, and the notion of *information processing* in cognitive science, has long been controversial. But as the present paper shows, part of the disagreement arises from conflating different formulations of measurement. Clarifying distinctions reveals it is the context-free nature of Shannon's information average that is particular problematic from the cognitive point of view. Context-sensitive evaluation is then shown to be a way of addressing the problems that arise.",>Chris Thornton,>University of Sussex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0629/index.html
2013,Verifying properties from different emotions produces switching costs: Evidence for coarse-grained language statistics and fine-grained perceptual simulation,"We investigated whether emotions are activated during comprehension of emotion words. In the first part of the study, an experiment was conducted in which participants read sentence pairs each describing an emotional state and then engaged in a judgment task. Sentences were paired to either match or mismatch in emotion (happy, sad, or angry). We predicted that the sentences that mismatch in emotion produced longer reaction times than those where the emotion was the same, and that shifts between negative emotions had less of an impact. In the second part of the study, we calculated the frequency of first-order co-occurrences of nouns and adjectives related to happy, sad, and angry emotional states. This analysis demonstrated emotion words are more often accompanied by similar emotion words. Match and mismatch of emotion explained RTs as did statistical linguistic frequencies of the words. The combination of these two studies contributes to a growing body of research that supports the importance of both symbolic and perceptual processing of emotion.",>Richard Tillman>Sterling Hutchinson>Sara Jordan>Max Louwerse,">The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA>The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA>Methodist North Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA>The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA; Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0630/index.html
2013,Geographical Estimates are Explained by Perceptual Simulation and Language Statistics,"Several studies have demonstrated that language encodes geographical information. That is, the relative longitude and latitude of city locations can be extracted from language. Whether people actually rely on these linguistic features is less clear. Recent studies have suggested that language statistics plays a role in geographical estimates, but these studies rely on map drawings, a fundamentally perceptual task. The current study investigated the extent to which people rely on map representations and statistical linguistic frequencies by using a linguistic task. Participants saw U.S. city pairs in their iconic positions (a more northern city is presented above a more southern city, or a more western city is presented to the left of a more eastern city), and in their reverse-iconic positions (a more southern city is presented above a more northern city, or a more eastern city is presented to the left of a more western city). For iconic city pairs both in the east – west (Seattle – Boston) and north – south (Memphis – Miami) configurations, RTs were determined by the iconicity. No effect was obtained for statistical linguistic frequencies. However, when city pairs were presented in a reverse-iconic configuration, for both horizontal (Boston – Seattle) and vertical (Miami – Memphis) orientations, both perceptual and linguistic factors explained RTs. These findings support the idea that cognition relies on a shallow heuristic, a linguistic system, and a fine-grained and more precise perceptual simulation system.",>Richard Tillman>Sterling Hutchinson>Max Louwerse,">The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA>The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA>The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA; Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0631/index.html
2013,Empirical investigation on spatial templates for a diagonal spatial term,"The meaning of spatial relations have been intensively studied in cognitive science research. A spatial template is one of the typical representations of spatial relations, which maps a position of a located object to its acceptability for the corresponding spatial term. Spatial templates have been investigated for several orthogonal spatial relations. However, diagonal spatial relations have attracted less attention. The present study aims at empirically determining the spatial template for a Japanese diagonal spatial term, ""migiue (upper right)"". The data was collected with various geometrical conditions changing the size of objects and the aspect ratio of the background. The analysis of the data revealed that the reference axis for ""migiue (upper right)"" was the direction of 45 degrees, and the acceptability of the diagonal relation could be affected by the acceptable regions of the adjacent orthogonal relations.",>Takenobu Tokunaga>Toshiaki Watatani>Ryu Iida>Asuka Terai,>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Tokyo Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0632/index.html
2013,How intonation contrains pragmatic inference,"In this paper, we present two experiments that investigate how intonation can constrain pragmatic inference. While prior research has shown that intonation can increase the likelihood of an inference being made, less is known about how it affects the mechanisms involved in processing of inferences. In the first experiment, listeners had more direct mouse paths towards target responses for stronger interpretations after hearing utterances with referents with pitch accents than without. In the second experiment, we replicate the finding of the first study and found more direct mouse paths towards weaker interpretations after hearing de-accented referents Our findings suggest that intonation constrains the online processing of pragmatic inference by increasing the availability of stronger interpretations.",>John M.

2013,The visual motion aftereffect from mental imagery depends on speed,"When we imagine a train snaking through a desert, does information about the train’s speed make it into our visual mental image? In this paper, we make use of the motion aftereffect illusion (MAE) to test whether the speed of imagined visual motion modulates transfer of adaptation to a subsequent visual motion discrimination task. We compared the effects of viewing slow, medium, and fast motion on the magnitude of the MAE (Experiment 1) with the effects of simply imagining the same motion stimuli (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1 we found that increasing the speed of real visual motion from slow to medium produced a corresponding increase in the magnitude of the MAE, but increasing speed from medium to fast did not. Likewise, imagining slow motion produced a smaller MAE than did imagining medium motion, but the effect leveled of between medium and fast motion. These findings suggest that our mental imagery of motion is specific to the speed of the moving objects, and highlight areas of overlap between mental imagery and visual perception.",>Alexia Toskos Dils>Lera Boroditsky,>Stanford University>Stanford university,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0634/index.html

2013,Do people understand irony from computers?,"In this paper, we empirically investigate whether people understand irony from computers in order to test the recent argument for an egocentric tendency in irony comprehension. In the experiment, participants took a timed math test comprising 10 questions of 3-digit by 2-digit multiplication. After that, they received a feedback comment on their performance (including potentially ironic sentences) from either an intelligent evaluation system with an AI engine (AI condition), a nonintelligent automatic evaluation system (Auto condition), or a human judge connected via the network (Human condition). The result was that the participants in the AI and Auto conditions understood the comment as ironic as those in the Human condition, and the participants in the AI condition perceived more sarcasm than other participants. Because people know that computers cannot think just as humans do, these results can be regarded as evidence for the egocentric tendency in irony comprehension, indicating that participants understood irony egocentrically fromtheir own perspective without taking into account the mental state of the ironic speaker. These findings are also consistent with the “media equation” theory, from which we can suggest implications for the media equation, anthropomorphism, and computer-mediated communication of irony.",>Akira Utsumi>Yu Watanabe>Yusuke Wakayama,>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0638/index.html

Second, we use the learned affordances for making multi-step plans. Specifically, an iCub humanoid platform is equipped with a perceptual system to sense objects placed on a table, as well as the presence and state of humans in the environment, and a behavioral repertoire that consisted of simple object manipulations as well as voice behaviors that are uttered simple verbs.

We test one core claim of this account, that count nouns should cue attention to the shape of the objects.

Participants were invited to complete additions presented on paper without using their hands or any artefact; in a second, interactive, condition, the same problems were presented in the form of a set of manipulable tokens. Math anxiety was significantly correlated with mental arithmetic performance only in the static condition. The results of a mediation analysis indicated that the effect of math anxiety on mental arithmetic was mediated by working memory capacity in the static condition; in the interactive condition, math anxiety and working memory did not significantly correlate with performance. Interactivity encouraged the coupling of internal and external resources to create a cognitive system that augmented and transformed working memory capacity, diffusing the resource drain caused by math anxiety.",>Frédéric Vallée-Tourangeau>Miroslav Sirota>Gaëlle Villejoubert,>Kingston University>King's College>Kingston University London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0641/index.html

A 2x2 design with factors Training (Practice/Example study) and Embodiment (Present/Absent) was used (N = 80). Results showed a large main effect of Training on effort investment in learning and on retention test performance, with Example study leading to higher scores with lower investment of effort during the learning phase than Practice. Numerically, Embodiment seemed to have an effect, with participants practicing/studying the task with embodied objects (plastic animals) performing worse on retention than participants practicing/ studying with non-embodied objects (discs), but this did not reach statistical significance.

In the first stage of the experiment, participants indicated whether they recognized a number of Italian and US cities. In the second stage, they decided which of two cities had the larger population. Crucially, names of the cities were not available in the second stage, but participants could find out whether they had recognized them (yes/no) in the first stage of the experiment (i.e., pure recognition). Additional predictive cues (e.g., presence/absence of a university) were also available. Participants used the recognition cue about 50% of the time, rarely examined it first, and used it differently as a function of whether recognition information was binary or continuous. Furthermore, participants used the recognition cue more often if they recognized more items, irrespective of its predictive validity.

2013,The Path Less Taken: When Working Memory Capacity Constrains Insight,"Higher working memory capacity (WMC) supports performance on a wide variety of complex cognitive and academic activities (Barret, Tugade, & Engle, 2004). However, a growing body of research demonstrates that higher WMC can have disadvantages—leading individuals to employ complex performance strategies that are less optimal for a given task (cf. DeCaro & Beilock, 2010). We examine this possibility in the domain of insight problem solving. Participants (N=84) completed Matchstick Arithmetic problems thought to either rely on controlled search and retrieval processes (non-insight problems) or diverging from known mathematical constraints (insight problems). Consistent with a large body of research on WMC, higher WMC was associated with higher non-insight problem accuracy. However, higher WMC led to significantly worse insight problem-solving. Although higher WMC supports complex problem-solving strategies, relying on these may lead individuals to miss associatively-driven solutions that are important for insight.",>Charles Van Stockum>Marci DeCaro,>University of Louisville>University of Louisville,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0644/index.html

The present study investigated whether the degree of activation of visual information in this process is dependent on the situational relevance of this information. We used the Proactive Interference (PI) paradigm. In two experiments, we manipulated the information by which objects could be retrieved from memory: by both semantic and shape information or by shape information only. The pattern of PI-release showed that if objects could be stored and retrieved both by semantic and shape information, then shape information was overruled by semantic information. If, however, semantic information could not be (satisfactorily) used to store and retrieve objects, then objects were stored in memory in terms of their shape.",>Lisanne van Weelden>Joost Schilperoord>Marc Swerts>Diane Pecher,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Erasmus University Rotterdam,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0645/index.html

We hypothesized that a transposition of the Italian Sign Language to its written counterpart could enhance signing deaf individuals’ comprehension and learning from text. We confirmed our prediction for comprehension and learning for technical texts in Experiment 1 and for narrative texts in Experiment 2; signing deaf individuals’ text comprehension and learning therefore benefit from a written language whose structure reflects the structure of their visual-spatial sign language.

Cultural transmission caused the whistled systems to become more learnable and more structured.

2013,Cognitive load does not decrease pronoun use when speaker’s and addressee’s perspectives are dissociated,"It has been suggested that a referent’s accessibility is affected by the degree to which it is in the speaker’s attention. Assuming that less accessible referents are less likely to be pronominalized, this predicts that speakers under cognitive load use more elaborate referring expressions. However, speakers under load may also have difficulty taking into account their addressee’s perspective, which may either lead to more use of the speaker’s own discourse model or to more economic expressions. To tease these effects apart, we conducted a story completion experiment in which cognitive load was manipulated by the presence or absence of a secondary task for the speaker. In addition, we dissociated the speaker’s and the addressee’s perspectives. Our results do not provide evidence for the hypothesis that cognitive load reduces the accessibility of referents in the speaker’s own discourse model, suggesting that speaker attention does not determine accessibility.",>Jorrig Vogels>Emiel Krahmer>Alfons Maes,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0652/index.html

We found that urban infants are exposed to more than three times as much speech and co-speech gestures than rural infants. The results show that the amounts of co-speech gestures and speech predict later vocabulary development in the urban community, but not in the rural community. The results further show that rural infants are delayed in their vocabulary development, which may in part be explained by a transition in the socialization style rural infants experience between the age of 1;1 and 1;5.",>Paul Vogt>J.

Here we explore the idea that people’s probability judgments often may not refer to the relative frequency of a set, but instead to the probability of an explanatory logical pattern given the data. This idea has been formalized by Bayesian logic (BL), predicting a system of frequency-based logical inclusion fallacies. The studies presented concentrate on comparing probability judgments about sentences logically relating two attributes of a class or an individual (humans, animals, artifacts). Although BL cannot model probabilities of individual predications directly, it can do so if one assumes that inferences are made about unknown individuals based on imagined samples. The results for general as well as individual predication show a high number of systematic inclusion fallacies in line with BL. Nevertheless, some deviations were found. In the General Discussion, a polycausal approach to inclusion fallacies is advocated.",>Momme von Sydow,>University of Heidelberg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0654/index.html
2013,The role of sampling assumptions in generalization with multiple categories,"The extent to which people learning categories generalize should depend in part on their beliefs about how the instances were sampled. Bayesian models of sampling have been successful in predicting that generalization can decrease as more instances of a category are encountered. This has only been shown in tasks were instances are all from the same category, but contrasts with the predictions from most standard models of categorization that predict when multiple categories exist, people are more likely to generalize to categories that have more instances when distances between categories is controlled. In this current work we show that in both one- and two-category scenarios, people adjust their generalization behavior based on cover story and number of instances. These patterns of generalization at an individual level for both one- and two-category scenarios were well accounted for by a Bayesian model that relies on a mixture of sampling assumptions.",>Wai Keen Vong>Andrew Hendrickson>Amy Perfors>Daniel Navarro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0655/index.html

In this research, we analyzed preschoolers’ collaboration as an information gathering activity in a toy assembly activity. We independently assessed children’s competency at a similar building task and, using a separate group of children, the difficulty of each step of the activity. We hypothesized that children would request collaborative assistance when they needed assistance (that is, when they were less competent and/or the task was more difficult), but act independently when capable. The results confirmed that preschoolers were more likely to request collaborative assistance as the difficulty of the activity increased and more so if they were initially less competent.

2013,When words get physical: evidence for proficiency-modulated somatotopic motor interference during second language comprehension,"New theories of cognition posit the existence of an intimate link between higher cognitive processes and the sensorimotor areas of the brain. In a reaction time-based translation task, second language (L2) speakers responded to action verbs using a microphone or a response pad. A significant interaction among Response Modality, Verb Type, and Proficiency indicated that more proficient L2 speakers took significantly longer to respond with their hands to previously seen hand-related verbs, but not mouth-related ones. Conversely, responding using a microphone led to slower latencies in the case of mouth-verbs, but not hand-verbs. Amidst virtually exclusively monolingual research on embodied cognition, the current study provides evidence that reading L2 action verbs selectively interferes with subsequently performed manual or verbal responses, suggesting that semantic representations of these verbs are distributed over neural substrates underlying action execution. The role of proficiency and experience in language comprehension is discussed.",>Nikola Vukovic,">University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0657/index.html
2013,Slow drift of individuals' magnitude-to-number mapping.,"When estimating the number of dots in a set, adults show bias and variability that scale with numerosity. Increasing variance in estimation is thought to reflect constant Weber noise on perceptual magnitude representations, while the increasing bias reflects miscalibrated mappings of number words onto magnitudes. Here we argue that response variability in numerical estimation increases with numerosity in part due to uncertainty and slow drift in the mapping of numbers onto magnitudes. We show that individuals' number-to-magnitude mapping functions drift slowly over the course of the experiment, with a shared-variance half-life of over 100 trials ($\sim 10$ min). We thus propose a model that treats the word-to-magnitude mapping function as a major source of estimation variability, and that accounts for cross-subject differences in estimation bias and variability, as well as changes to estimation performance within a given subject over time. In doing so, we reconcile the existing literature on the sources of estimation variability, and provide evidence that uncertainty in the word-to-magnitude mapping function is a key limiting factor in estimation performance.",>Edward Vul>David Barner>Jess Sullivan,>UCSD Psychology>UCSD Psychology>UCSD Psychology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0658/index.html
2013,Effects of Parafoveal Plausibility During Reading,"There is controversy concerning the question of whether meaning can be extracted from a parafoveal word during reading and whether this might occur in an overlapping fashion with the lexical processing of the currently-fixated word. We suggest that previous attempts to investigate this have been bedevilled by problems associated with the use of priming methodology. Instead, we used an eye movement contingent change technique and manipulated the plausibility of the parafoveal preview, resulting in it being either valid, a plausible alternative, anomalous, or an illegal letter string. The results showed (a) a meaning-based parafoveal-on-foveal effect, (b) preview benefits driven by both orthographic and semantic influences, and (c) continuing disruption associated with orthographically dissimilar previews. We suggest that this pattern is most consistent with models of eye movement control that allow for distributed attention during reading.",>Laura Wakeford>Wayne Murray,">University of Dundee, Dundee, Angus, Scotland>University of Dundee, Dundee, Angus, Scotland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0659/index.html
2013,"Later events lie behind her, but not behind you: Compatibility effects for temporal sequences along the sagittal axis depend on perspective","Perspective plays a large role in how we think about space. Does perspective also influence how we think about abstract concepts, such as time—which is closely associated with how we think about space? Linguistic patterns suggest that speakers talk about temporal sequences from two perspectives: field-based and ego perspective (Moore, 2011). However, the psychological reality of these mappings beyond their use in language is unclear. The present study examines whether sequential reasoning recruits the sagittal axis differently, depending on the perspective adopted. We manipulated perspective by using pronouns meant to evoke a field-based or ego perspective (“her” vs “your”, respectively). Participants made earlier-than or later-than judgments about event sequences using a mouse in front of or behind their body. We observed an interaction between pronoun, temporal reference, and response location. Participants map space onto time differently depending on the frame of reference from which temporal sequences are interpreted.",>Esther Walker>Benjamin Bergen>Rafael Nunez,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0660/index.html
2013,A Computational Model of the Development of Hemispheric Asymmetry of Face Processing,"Extensive research effort has been invested in building neurocomputational models for face and object recognition. However, the relationship between the recognition model and the development of the visual system is rarely considered. Research on the development of contrast sensitivity shows that human infants can only perceive low spatial frequency information from visual stimuli, but their acuity improves gradually with age. Also, the right hemisphere (RH) develops earlier than the left hemisphere (LH), and is dominant in infants. Here we show that these constraints, coupled with a desire on the part of the infant to individuate its caretakers and family, leads naturally to the right hemisphere bias for face processing. We propose a developmental model for face and object recognition using a modular neural network based on Dailey and Cottrell (1999). This neural network represents the two hemispheres using two modules, with a competitive relationship between them mediated by a gating mechanism. The strong RH and low spatial frequency bias for face recognition emerges naturally in the model from the interaction of the slow development of acuity and the early dominance of the right hemisphere. Remarkably, this strong asymmetry does not appear to hold for the other object categories that we tried.",>Panqu Wang>Garrison Cottrell,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0661/index.html
2013,Intentional Constraints on the Dynamics of Human Performance and Behavioral Variability in Motor Control,"Manipulation of environmental constraints has been shown to influence the relative amounts of voluntary and involuntary control employed by a person to complete a task, as well as the resulting structure of performance variability. Generally, the voluntary control required when no constraints are present leads to self-similar changes in performance, some constraint provides involuntary control that leads to random fluctuations in performance, and constraint which provides feedback about performance accuracy can result in anti-persistent variability. The current study investigated whether providing two groups of individuals with different intentions for the same task would produce changes in voluntary and involuntary control similar to that observed following the manipulation of task constraints. Results indicated that a difference in intention does result in divergent uses of voluntary and involuntary control and distinctly different structures in performance variability.",>Auriel Washburn>Charles Coey>Michael Richardson,">Univeristy of Cincinnati , Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0662/index.html
2013,Grouping by Similarity Helps Concept Learning,"In inductive learning, the order in which concept instances are presented plays an important role in learning performance. Theories predict that interleaving instances of different con- cepts is especially beneficial if the concepts are highly sim- ilar to each other, whereas blocking instances belonging to the same concept provides an advantage for learning low- similarity concept structures. This leaves open the question of the relative influence of similarity on interleaved versus blocked presentation. To answer this question, we pit within- and between-category similarity effects against each other in a rich categorization task called Physical Bongard Problems. We manipulate the similarity of instances shown temporally close to each other with blocked and interleaved presentation. The results indicate a stronger effect of similarity on interleaving than on blocking. They further show a large benefit of com- paring similar between-category instances on concept learning tasks where the feature dimensions are not known in advance but have to be constructed.",>Erik Weitnauer>Paulo F.

2013,Modeling Bilingual Children’s Acquisition of Complex Sentences in German,"Although Bilingual First Language Acquisition research has increased considerably over the past few decades, there is still much controversy regarding the rate of development, i.e. the question whether bilinguals lag behind their monolingual peers in various aspects of language. Some studies have found similar rates of development, whereas others have found that bilingual children lag behind their monolingual peers. The current study contributes to this discussion of (dis)similar rates of development by investigating bilingual children’s acquisition of German complex sentence constructions involving adverbial clauses (ACs). Our findings are consistent with usage-based approaches to language acquisition, which predict that bilingual acquisition should proceed slower due to learners having less exposure, on average, to each language.",>Daniel Wiechmann>Judith Steinfeld>Elma Kerz,>RWTH Aachen University>RWTH Aachen University>RWTH Aachen University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0664/index.html

In this paper we claim that people’s intuitions about what to do in Bridge are robust, while intuitions about Switch can be influenced rather easily. In doing so, we strongly disagree with Broeders and colleagues (2011) who recently argued for exactly the opposite claim. We discuss their interpretation of previous findings that were supposed to motivate their claim, present findings from previous studies that strongly support my claim, and report on failed attempts to replicate and present an experiment in which participants were willing to revise their judgment for Switch but not for Bridge.",>Alex Wiegmann>Matthias Lippold>Robert  Grigull,>University of Goettingen>University of Goettingen>University of Goettingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0665/index.html

In a series of studies we have been investigating the effects of group composition in terms of math ability on learning by invention. An initial result showed that groups consisting of a mix of both high and low math ability students generated a broader range of solution attempts when asked to invent a formula for standard deviation compared to more homogeneous math ability groups. Moreover, this wider range of solution alternatives predicted better performance on quizzes following a lesson on the topic. Subsequent work is suggesting that who emerges as the leader of the group matters. Ongoing analyses are also exploring which features of the collaborative discourse are critical for students to take advantage of the affordances of learning by invention.",>Jennifer Wiley>Olga Goldenberg>Andrew Jarosz>Michael Wiedmann>Nikol Rummel,>UIC>UIC>UIC>Universitat Freiburg>Ruhr Universitat Bochum,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0666/index.html
2013,Dual Processes in Mental State Understanding: Is Theorising Synonymous with Intuitive Thinking and is Simulation Synonymous with Reflective Thinking?,"In this paper we develop an idea first mooted by Wilkinson, Ball, and Cooper (2010), which is that the dichotomy between theory-based and simulation-based reasoning in the context of mental state understanding is synonymous with the distinction between intuitive and reflective thinking in dual-process accounts of human reasoning (e.g., Evans, 2010). To support this proposal we draw upon a range of concepts and findings deriving from both mainstream reasoning research and from studies of social cognition. We also consider the implications of our proposal for the formulation of an integrative approach to understanding reasoning in all of its many manifestations, whether undertaken for the attainment of socially-oriented goals or for the purposes of learning and discovery.",>Meredith Wilkinson>Linden Ball,>De Montfort University>University of Central Lancashire,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0667/index.html

Participants learned how to rank students across courses using statistical concepts of deviation, and did so while either explaining sample rankings or writing their thoughts during study. We additionally varied whether or not candidate hypotheses about the basis for ranking were presented to participants prior to learning, and the number of sample rankings that violated intuitive misconceptions about ranking. Measures of learning and coded responses suggest that prompting people to explain can increase the rate at which they entertain both correct and incorrect hypotheses, but that explaining promotes the selection of a hypothesis that can account for anomalous observations.",>Joseph Jay Williams>Caren Walker>Samuel Maldonado>Tania Lombrozo,>University of California Berkeley>University of California Berkeley>University of California Berkeley>University of California Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0668/index.html
2013,Impulsivity and Overall Similarity Classification,"It is sometimes argued that implementation of an overall similarity classification is less effortful than implemen- tation of a single-dimension classification. One piece of evidence taken to be in support of this argument is that highly impulsive individuals appear to be more likely to sort on the basis of overall similarity than individuals with low impulsivity (Ward, 1983); presumably, higher impulsivity results in lower effort. In the current arti- cle, we identify some limitations in Ward’s procedure and, using a more standard measure of impulsivity and a less ambiguous measure of overall similarity classifica- tion, re-investigate the relationship between impulsivity and overall similarity classification. Using a match-to- standard procedure, the current experiment finds that overall similarity classification is less prevalent in highly impulsive individuals. The implications of this result, which is opposite to that reported by Ward (1983), are discussed.",>Andy Wills>Chris Longmore>Fraser Milton,>Plymouth University>Plymouth University>Exeter University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0669/index.html

We investigate the relationship between these two orientations when people generate random numbers. In the horizontal condition, people generated larger numbers when they looked right as opposed to left. In the vertical condition, people generated larger numbers when they looked up as opposed to down. We present two main results based on analyses that compare the two spatial orientations. First, we show that the vertical effect was stronger than the horizontal one. Second, we show a weak correlation between the vertical and the horizontal effect, potentially suggesting a shared underlying mechanism.",>Bodo Winter>Teenie Matlock,">University of California, Merced, Dept. of Cognitive and Information Sciences>University of California, Merced, Dept. of Cognitive and Information Sciences",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0670/index.html

2013,"Why we Should Not Forget About the Non-social World: Subjective Preferences, Exploratory Eye-movements, and Individual Differences","We investigated both subjective and objective differences in viewing non-social versus social scenes. Specifically, we examined four related questions: 1) Do participants prefer non-social or social scenes? 2) Are there differences in subjective exploration of non-social and social scenes? 3) Are there differences in objective exploration of these scenes? 4) Does a non-social trait – connection to nature – influence the extent of non-social scene exploration? Experiment 1 found, surprisingly, that participants prefer non-social over social scenes, and correspondingly, they reported exploring these scenes more. Experiment 2 used eye-tracking to test the validity of this introspection and confirmed that participants explore non-social scenes more than social scenes. We also discovered that connection to nature selectively modulates exploration of non-social scenes, demonstrating a critical interaction between observer and scene characteristics in the deployment of spatial attention.",>David W.-L.

Older (18-24 months) and younger (12-17 months) children were introduced to novel events. An experimenter pressed a red handle and a lollipop emerged from a box; she then pressed a green handle and a cake emerged. These events were repeated three times. On the fourth trial, the experimenter switched either the order or relationship between events. In the Deterministic condition, the experimenter pressed the green handle first and the red handle second; in the Probabilistic condition, the red handle produced the cake and the green handle produced the lollipop. On the test trial, the experimenter pressed the red handle and a hand emerged, holding the lollipop. The older toddlers looked longer at the hand in the Deterministic than the Probabilistic condition, suggesting they inferred a hidden cause when the events occurred probabilistically.",>Yang Wu>Paul Muentener>Laura Schulz,">Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT>Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT>Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0673/index.html

Seventy-four 2 to 4 years old Chinese children participated in 3 tasks using toys that could be shared with a puppet that was animated by a female experimenter. On each task, the puppet expressed her desire for the items using a series of cues that progressively became more communicative. Children’s ToM understanding was assessed with the scale of ToM tasks (Wellman, Fang, Liu, Zhu, & Liu, 2006). There were two main findings: (1) younger children relied on more explicit communicative cues to share resources with the puppet, while older children shared more spontaneously and (2) children’s sharing behavior was positively correlated to their ToM scores, independent of age. Findings suggest that preschoolers’ sharing behavior is enhanced by their ToM understanding and explicit communicative cues provided by a social partner.",>Zhen Wu>Yanjie Su,">University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United States>Peking University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0674/index.html

Our study aims to elaborate on the validity of this analogy for search in memory. Using the search of associative memory framework (SAM) we show that people are able to dynamically recruit independent memory representations in the recall of country names. By instructing participants to use specific recall cues we also show that despite a strong effect on the retrieval sequence, total recall from memory remains unaffected. Whereas these findings strongly support a higher dimensionality to memory than often assumed, the simultaneous finding of severe retrieval time costs for non-default representations suggests that the use of particular retrieval structures may be adaptive. In sum, our results support local-to-global memory search strategies similar to foraging strategies in space, but further suggest that memory is not constrained to one local representation, but may indeed support many.",>DIrk U.

2013,Implicit learning: A demonstration and a revision to a novel SRT paradigm,"Yeates, Jones, Wills, Aitken, McLaren and McLaren (2012) devised a serial reaction time (SRT) task that provided evidence for human learning without awareness. Adapting the SRT paradigm usually employed to investigate implicit learning, participants responded to two simple white circle fills on either side of a screen. Instead of these following a sequence that participants were unaware of (e.g. Willingham, Nissen & Bullemer, 1989) this task involved a separate stimulus, which was sometimes predictive of one of the circle fills. A square in the center of the screen would fill with one of eight colors before each circle fill: one of these colors predicted a right circle fill and the other a left on 80% of trials on which those colors occurred. When pressing the key that followed the consistent response trained with these two colors, participants were both faster and more accurate than when responding to either the inconsistent response or control colors. Participants demonstrated a lack of contingency awareness, performing at chance in identifying the predictive colors and on a suitably sensitive prediction task. On reanalyzing this result, this paper shows that it was confounded with a sequential artifact produced by the experimental design itself. Pilot studies demonstrated weak learning of color contingencies when the artifact was removed, thus we sought to improve learning by both increasing the amount of training and placing the predictive color cue on the circle fills. Without the sequential artifact, we can produce the same result, although we concede the effect is less robust than we first indicated. Thus, we are able to reiterate our original conclusion: that this task can demonstrate learning of color contingencies in the absence of awareness and can be used to investigate implicit learning in humans.",>Fayme Yeates>Fergal W.

In 4 ``adaptation'' experiments, we provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis that quantifiers are represented as probability distributions over scales (e.g., Zadeh, 1965). We manipulate exposure to different distributions of ``some'' and ``many'' and find that listeners adapt to those distributions, as predicted.

Results show that even though supervision was weaker than in previous studies, attention optimization and cost of attention were observed during category learning (Experiment 1). Moreover, there were faster learning and stronger attention optimization when statistically denser categories were learned (Experiment 2). At the same time, there were weaker costs of selective attention when learning denser categories than when learning sparser categories.

Analysis of group and sub-group spatial structure,"We combine video recording and laser range tracking to analyse the geometrical structure of groups of walking pedestrians socially interacting. By recording their relative position and observing their social interaction for a large enough time span we can analyse the stability and universality of their spatial structure. We find that while 2-pedestrian and 3-pedestrian groups have a relatively ``time stable'' and ``universal'' geometrical structure (an abreast formation for pairs, and a ``V'' formation for triads, with the central pedestrian walking slightly behind), no such structure emerges for larger groups. Nevertheless, these larger groups result to be composed of time stable two or three people sub-groups with the same ``universal'' geometrical structure of isolated pairs and triads.",>Francesco Zanlungo>Takayuki Kanda,">IRC ATR, Keihanna science city, Kyoto, Japan>IRC  ATR, Keihanna science city, Kyoto, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0680/index.html
2013,Unstable Dynamics of Intrinsically Motivated Learning,"Employing the dynamical systems framework, we study the effects of intrinsic motivation on the dynamics of the learning processes. The intrinsic motivation here is the one’s desire to learn not because it may cause some benefits in future, but due to the inherent joy obtained by the very process of learning. We study a simple example of a single agent adapting to unknown environment; the agent is biased by the desire to select the actions she has little information about. We show that intrinsic motivation may cause the instability of the learning process that is stable in the case of rational agent. Therefore, we suggest that the effects of human intrinsic motivation in particular and the irrationality in general may be of exceptional importance in complex sociopsychological systems and deserve much attention in the formal models of such systems.",>Arkady Zgonnikov>Ihor Lubashevsky,">University of Aizu, Aizu-wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan>University of Aizu, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0681/index.html

2013,Complexity Matching in Dyadic Interaction,"Recent theoretical discussion of dyadic coordination has focused on issues of synchronization, entrainment, alignment, and convergence. All of these terms refer to matching of specific behavioral and linguistic events, such that members of a dyad coordinate by “doing the same thing.” Communicative behaviors tend to be highly variable, like most human behaviors. These tendencies suggest the possibility of complexity matching: Statistical measures of behavioral complexity may converge in certain types of dyadic interaction. In the present study, acoustic speech signals of interlocutors were measured in two conversational conditions, one argumentative and the other affiliative. Signal complexity was measured in terms of heavy tails and power laws in the distributional and temporal properties of acoustic event series, respectively. Parameters of statistical functions were found to vary by conversation type, as did their matching between interlocutors. Results demonstrate a new way to quantify the coordination of interlocutors in terms of complexity matching.",>Drew Abney>Alexandra Paxton>Chris Kello>Rick Dale,">University of California, Merced, Merced, California, USA>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0683/index.html

Surveys consisting of measures of several biases often aim to compare rate of occurrence of these biases and to compile a composite index from these measures. Unfortunately, the probability that the participant chooses the normative answer on the test questions often varies between and within studies, thus confounding the results. Another complication in the surveys used is that some incorrect answers are not necessarily the result of the studied bias. In our work, we tried to overcome these methodological challenges in a new survey of 15 cognitive biases.

After viewing a massive number of images for nearly six hours participants were highly accurate at identifying a previously seen image in a two-alternative forced choice task even when the foil was extremely similar to the target. In present study we hypothesised that this impressive memory performance might be specific to the test format. To investigate the effect of test format on recognition accuracy we showed participants 1700 images for 2.5 hours and then tested them in a forced choice task and a yes/no task, where participants judged only one image at a time. We found that accuracy was relatively high in both test conditions; however, the performance was lower in the yes/no task (75% vs. 86%).

Participants rated the appropriateness of the agent's conclusion about the adequacy of the sample size (which, objectively, was more than adequate), along with the agent's intelligence. Whereas previous work suggests that unbelievable statistical conclusions impact reasoning by provoking critical thought which enhances the detection of research flaws, the present studies presented participants an unflawed scenario designed to assess effects of believability on bias. The results included the finding that participants' complete knowledge indeed biased their perceptions not only of the adequacy of the sample size, but also of the rationality of the agent drawing the conclusion from the sample.

2013,"Semantic interference in language production is due to graded similarity, not response relevance","There is an ongoing debate on whether semantic interference effects in language production reflect competitive lexical selection or post-lexical response exclusion mechanisms driven by the response-relevant status of distractor words. To disentangle categorical relatedness and task-defined response relevance effects, we combined the picture-word interference task with the conditional naming paradigm in an orthogonal design. Participants were instructed to name objects typically located in or on the water (e.g. canoe) and refrain from naming objects typically located outside the water (e.g. bike), and vice versa. Semantic relatedness and response relevance of distractors were manipulated independently. Linear mixed model analyses were conducted with semantic similarity ratings of target-distractor as continuous predictor. The pattern of results revealed that semantic similarity beyond categorical relations is critical for interference effects to be observed, and not response relevance. These findings provide support for the assumption that lexical selection is competitive and that semantic interference effects in the PWI paradigm reflect this competition.",>Sabrina Aristei>Rasha Abdel Rahman,">Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Berlin, Germany>Humboldt-University of Berlin",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0687/index.html

Then, the experts and novices participated in the controllability judgment task (i.e. a kind of the risk judgment task) with use of similar stimuli in the discrimination task. They were allowed to continue to judge for gain whether they were in an uncontrollably higher risk state with larger variances. They could stop the trial to make smaller costs.

2013,Sleep deprivation accelerates delay-related loss of visual short-term memories without affecting precision,"Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is a limited information store that supports many higher-order cognitive processes. Here we examined how two challenges to VSTM, sleep deprivation (SD) and maintenance duration, interact to affect the number and precision of stored items. Participants were studied twice, once after a normal night of sleep and once following a night of total SD. For each trial, participants remembered the location and color of three squares over a variable delay (1 or 10 seconds), reporting the color of the cued item using a color wheel. The probability of reporting the target item, the precision of report, and the probability of reporting a distractor item were determined using mixture modeling. SD reduced the number of integrated representations that could be reported, an effect compounded by delay. In contrast, SD had no effect on VSTM precision. These results suggest all-or-none memory failures, not gradual degradation, during SD.",>Christopher L. Asplund>Natalie Wee>Michael W.L.

Peer confederate’s verbal behavior was tightly controlled to evoke argumentative discourse, holding content exposure constant but differing in rhetoric style. Students in the collaborative discourse style condition performed better. Moreover even though previous studies have reported that the belief of interaction with a human peer benefits learning in consensual settings, the opposite was found for a settings in which the partner critiques the learner’s own solutions: Students performed better when they believed they interacted with a computer agent (vs. with a human peer).

2013,Emotions in the space: arrangement and biases in preschool children and adults,With the first experiment of our study we have empirically tested the hypothesis that in adult and in adolescent subjects there is a consistency of the spatial representation of emotion terms. We explore the stability of the association between valence and verticality through modulation effect of the valence priming on spatial arrangement of emotion terms. In the second part of our study we focused on spatial representation of emotions by preschoolers when tested explicitly and implicitly with a task of spatial recall. It was found that the arrangement of emoticons on vertical and horizontal line by preschool children varied significantly as a function of the valence of emotions. The results from our third experiment suggest that the effect of the valence of nonverbal stimuli on the spatial recall was only evident when they were with a negative value and when placed at more central positions near to the horizontal line.,>Maria Atanassova-Trifonova>Dimitar Atanasov>Pavleta Ognyanova,">Institute of population and human studies, BAS>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0691/index.html
2013,A Bayesian Analysis of Bias in Single Item Recognition for Continuous Word frequency,"The relationship between word frequency (WF), measured on a continuous scale, and recognition memory was examined in a single item recognition task. The aim was to more clearly map the relationship between word frequency and memory performance. In marked contrastContrary to standard findings of a linear relationship when between WF and recognition,is treated as discrete, we observed a curvilinear pattern. Specifically, discriminability (d’) is higher at both the low and very high ends of the WF continuum. In addition, we observe shifts in bias (C) with a conservative bias for very high frequency (HF) words between WF and memory performance. Variations of a Bayesian signal detection model were then applied to the data in order to better understand the influences WF on measures of d’ and C. The models examined contrast the current explanations of the WF effect in recognition where C does not influence performance with a model where C is free vary as a function of WF.of a linear relationship between WF and discriminability (d’) in recognition memory, with the curvilinear pattern for both d’ and bias (C) with the curvilinear patterns observed in the current data set.

2013,Exploring Cross-Situational Learning and Mutual Exclusivity,"Cross-situational learning and mutual exclusivity are strategies proposed to explain the learning of word-meaning mappings. In this paper, seven possible strategies are explored and compared to the results of an artificial word learning experiment. The fixed order of trials in the experiment allows for an exposure-by-exposure approach to explore the individual learning process of words. The experiment shows that adult learners do indeed integrate knowledge from previous exposures, however they have difficulty in keeping track of cross-situational information for learning all twelve word-meaning mappings, although some learners can. The performance of 78 participants is compared to simulations in which various combinations of strategies were modeled. The results suggest that a random strategy with mutual exclusivity as its sole learning mechanism could explain the performance in the experiment. In this strategy, the learner selects an object at random from the context, provided that this object has not received a label yet.",>Suzanne Aussems>Paul Vogt,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0693/index.html
2013,Conditional reasoning with vertical spatial relations,"The aim of this study was to explore the effect of semantic congruence and spatial orientation on verification time of modus ponens (MP) and modus tollens (MT) conclusions. Factorial experiment (2x2x2) with repeated measures was carried out. Conditionals expressed the vertical relation of two objects in congruent (If cellar is down, then attic is up) or incongruent manner (If attic is down, then cellar is up). Eight pairs of words with clear vertical relation were used. Order of vertical relations in the conditional was also manipulated. Conditionals were in the form of “If P down, then Q up”, or “If P up, then Q down”. Participants (N=48) had to verify the presented conclusions in 64 tasks as quickly as possible. Significant effects for valid MP conclusions were obtained. Conclusions containing “down-up” order of relations in conditional premise were processed faster. Congruent spatial relations also facilitated faster answers.",>Igor Bajšanski>Pavle Valerjev>Tanja Gulan,>University of Rijeka>University of Zadar>University of Zadar,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0694/index.html
2013,Does interaction matter? Testing whether fast and frugal heuristics can replace interaction in collective decision-making,"In a range of contexts, pairs of interacting individuals arrive at collective decisions by comparing their confidence in their judgements. This tendency to evaluate the reliability of information by the confidence with which it is expressed has been termed the ‘confidence heuristic’. In this study, we tested two fast and frugal ways of implementing the confidence heuristic in the absence of interaction: either directly, by opting for the judgement made with higher confidence, or indirectly, by opting for the faster judgement, the latter exploiting a widely known inverse correlation between confidence and reaction time. We found that the success of these heuristics depends on how similar individuals are in terms of their abilities and, more importantly, that for dissimilar individuals such heuristics are dramatically inferior to interaction. Interaction allows individuals to alleviate – but not fully resolve – their differences in ability.",>Dan Bang>Riccardo Fusaroli>Kristian Tylén>Karsten Olsen>Peter Latham>Jennifer Lau>Andreas Roepstorff>Geraint Rees>Chris Frith>Bahador Bahrami,">Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University>Center for Semiotics, Aarhus University>Center for Semiotics, Aarhus University>Interacting Minds Centre, Aarhus University>Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London>Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University>Interacting Minds Centre, Aarhus University>Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London>Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London>Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0695/index.html
2013,An ACT-R model of the P300 event-related potential,"The excellent temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERPs) makes it an ideal technique to test the timing of events within cognitive models which may not be distinguishable using behavioural data. Here a model of an ERP component is presented which tests features of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The P300 is an event-related potential that is associated with attending to incoming stimuli and subsequent memory processing. It is commonly elicited using an oddball task in which a series of stimuli are presented comprising infrequent target stimuli against a background of frequent standard stimuli. It is influenced by the probability of a target in a sequence of stimuli. An ACT-R model was developed of the oddball task. P300 amplitude was correlated with the activation of the memory of the target stimuli, providing a good account of the component. The implications of these findings for the ACT-R architecture are discussed.",>Adrian Banks,>University of Surrey,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0696/index.html
2013,Context-dependent memory effects on syntax,"Recently, researchers in usage-based linguistics have argued that language should be thought of as a domain-general processing faculty operating on rich memory representations of particular experiences with language. If true, this would imply that context-dependent memory effects ought to be detectable across the language-nonlanguage boundary. Specifically, it would imply that that by manipulating nonlinguistic environmental context, it should be possible to influence people's linguistic production. This study reports three experiments testing whether environmental background color, music, or sound can influence participants' choice of active or passive voice in a picture-description task. Results suggest that the effect, if present, is not as clear-cut as has been argued by some language theorists, but there are promising signs that language production may indeed be susceptible to associative influence from the nonlinguistic environment.",>Brendan Barnwell,">UC Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0697/index.html
2013,Linguistic differences in explanation requests and their effects on the evaluation of explanations: the case of English and Turkish,"How does language shape thought? In particular, do cross-linguistic differences in how explanations are requested affect how explanations are evaluated by speakers of different languages? To address this question we contrasted English with Turkish, which has three distinct words that correspond to “why?” in English. Through two corpus studies and an experimental study, we established that Turkish “why” questions tend to appear in different contexts and elicit different kinds of explanations: the “why” questions vary in the frequency with which they refer to agents and elicit teleological explanations. In an experimental study investigating whether this cross-linguistic difference affects how explanations are evaluated, we found that while English speakers displayed an overall preference for mechanistic explanations in evaluating the stimuli, Turkish speakers provided similar satisfaction ratings for mechanistic and teleological explanations. Our findings have implications for the cognitive science of explanation and for debates about language and thought.",>Melih Barsbey>Tania Lombrozo,">Bogazici University, Department of Psychology>University of California, Berkeley, Department of Psychology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0698/index.html
2013,Effects of orthography on second language phonology: The production of geminate consonants in speakers of English as a Second Language,"We tested the hypothesis that the orthographic representations (‘spellings’) of second language (L2) words affect experienced L2 speakers’ pronunciation. In Italian, double consonant letters represent geminate (long) consonants. We predicted that Italian speakers of English would pronounce English words with longer consonants if spelled with double letter, e.g. a longer [t] in kitty than city. Three groups of Italian speakers of English performed different word production tasks with different stimuli: acoustic, acoustic and orthographic, or orthographic. The target voiceless stop consonants were presented inside 9 word pairs, spelled with one or two letters. Acoustic and auditory analyses revealed that the target consonants were longer in words spelled with double than with singleton letters, regardless of task. We argue that L2 speakers decode L2 orthographic representations using L1 orthography-phonology correspondences. This affects their pronunciation, even leading to the establishment of a phonological contrast (singleton-geminate) that is unattested in the target language.",>Benedetta Bassetti,>University of York,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0699/index.html
2013,Aligning Behaviors in Everyday Environments: An Ecological Perspective,"Collaborative remembering is a joint activity that involves the establishment and reinforcement of a common ground. In this study, we investigate some ways in which collaborative remembering involves interactive coordination of non-verbal behaviors. Our data consist of video recordings of small groups of people that are reconstructing holiday memories together. For each 500 ms, these videos have been annotated in terms of the participants' bodily behavior and posture, including variables such as manual gesture, shoulder shrugs, leaning direction and gaze. We compared instances of 'simultaneous alignment' (two or more people concurrently performing the same behavior) and 'sequential alignment' (two people performing the same behavior in short temporal succession) to chance baselines, and found that the latter is more common that the former. Our analysis furthermore suggests that the degree to which participants coordinate their behaviors is stable across the course of the conversation (i.e., time-independent), but connected with specific activities within the larger discourse of collaborative remembering.",>Lucas Bietti>Kasper Kok>Cienki Alan,>Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities>VU University Amsterdam>VU University Amsterdam,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0700/index.html

Two toys, one of them with a sticker attached, were presented to the child. It was not possible to request the toy with the sticker by asking (experimenter wore headphones) or pointing (toys were too close together), but they could show the experimenter which toy they wanted by performing the correct gesture. Children had to generate the correct iconic gestures themselves as the gestures were not modeled during test trials. On 70% of the trials children performed a correct gesture (p = .045), instead of only producing other response types (no response, verbal request, wrong gesture, pointing). This study shows that children understand that iconic gestures can represent objects, and also that they can use iconic gestures to communicate.",>Simone Bijvoet-van den Berg>Ulf Liszkowski>Elena Hoicka,">University of Stirling, Stirling, Scotland, United Kingdom>University of Hamburg>University of Sheffield",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0701/index.html

We present a computational model of the cognitive processes involved in establishing a novel referential communicative system, as operationalized with the Tacit Communication Game (TCG). This experimental paradigm has been used to study the socio-cognitive underpinnings of human communication. We model how players of the TCG can successfully generate and understand communicative behavior in a novel, visuospatial domain using Structure Mapping Theory (SMT). Many of the processes necessary to communicate in this game are forms of analogical reasoning that are captured by SMT (e.g. abstraction and analogical transfer). Yet, we also identify cognitive processes—not yet formalized under SMT—that are necessary for the genesis of new communicative systems. This is an important first step in formally characterizing this creative socio-cognitive ability.",>Mark Blokpoel>Todd Wareham>Ivan Toni>Iris van Rooij,">Radboud University, Donders Institute of Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands>Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada>Radboud University, Donders Institute of Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Donders Institute of Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0702/index.html

We are interested in how these are formed and what evidence they are based on. It has often been assumed that decision time is a frugal cue for confidence judgements: the longer it takes us to form a decision, the less certain we are. It could be, however, that this association is just a by-product of the underlying mechanisms, one of which could be variability in the accumulation of evidence. In our experiment, participants had to judge whether the average colour of an array of eight coloured shapes was either red or blue. We critically manipulated the variability of information in this multi-element array. Our results suggest that for conditions with matched difficulty, variability had a significant influence on confidence with more variable arrays leading to less confident judgements.",>Annika Boldt>Vincent de Gardelle>Christopher Summerfield>Nick Yeung,">University of Oxford>Laboratoire de Psychologie de la Perception, CNRS; Université Paris Descartes>University of Oxford>University of Oxford",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0703/index.html

Additionally, the current experiment provides insight into the processes underlying both A-B-A and A-B-C contextual renewal in humans; a process that is often explained using functional (Bouton, 2004; Pearce, 2002) or propositional (Havermans, Keuker, Lataster, & Jansen, 2005) accounts. Participants were exposed to an electrodermal contextual renewal paradigm in a bi-conditional design, whilst measures of both conscious expectancy and autonomic skin response were collected. Our results demonstrated that, despite successful acquisition and extinction for both measures, contextual renewal was only observed for conscious expectancy in the A-B-A renewal condition.",>W. A.

2013,Mechanisms of Active Causal Learning,"Existing studies on causal structure learning are largely restricted to single-shot interventions, usually in constrained or deterministic scenarios. However, real world causal learning is generally noisy, incremental and constrained only by prior beliefs. Here we describe experiments where participants were incentivised to infer the causal structure of probabilistic models through the free selection of multiple interventions. Participants’ sequences of intervention choices and on-line structure judgements were measured against those of an efficient Bayesian learner, which integrates information perfectly and intervenes to maximise expected utility. Successful participants were systematic and learned effectively, but chose markedly different intervention sequences to those of a Bayesian learner. Overall, we find evidence suggesting that causal structure learning is achieved by iteration of simple action-selection and causal-attribution mechanisms.",>Neil Bramley>David Lagnado>Maarten Speekenbrink,">University College London, London>University College London,London>University College London,London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0705/index.html
2013,Collaborative coactivation in visual search,"Individuals experience a redundancy gain when they respond faster to two signals than one. This benefit can derive from statistical facilitation of independent decisions (Raab 1962) or from the co-activation of signals before a decision (Miller, 1982). Here we applied these tests to the redundancy gain that occurs when pairs of participants work together to detect targets. We also compared gains when each partner was responsible for one of two targets versus a different spatial region. The results showed pairs were more efficient than individuals, and that this gain was greater when the task was divided by target identity versus by space. We also found that the collaborative redundancy gain could be characterized as co-activation, meaning that the benefit of collaboration exceeded that predicted by statistical facilitation. These results serve as a proof of concept that models developed to understand information processing in individuals can help characterize collaborative performances.",>Allison Brennan>James Enns,">University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada>University of British Columbia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0706/index.html

For all 3 tasks, performance increases with years in college. More interestingly, medical students performed best for the combined task and worst for the anatomy task.

We expect a normal dog to be four-legged; if it is not four-legged, we assume that something is wrong with this particular dog, or that it is incomplete as a kind of thing dog. Prasada & Dillingham (2009) showed that one reason we expect certain properties to be present is because we understand them to be aspects of the kinds of things. Our research offered an alternative hypothesis: these normative expectations are due to these distinct properties being beneficial in some way. Four experiments investigated this using statements that prompted responses for normative expectations. We found that while the beneficence of these properties does underwrite normative expectations to an extent, the predominant understanding was that these expectations were grounded in the aspectual quality of these properties.",>Dennis Bublitz>Sandeep Prasada,">CUNY, New York, NY, United States>CUNY, New York, NY, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0708/index.html

For example, an individual negotiating a new computer program will draw upon experience with similar programs, such as how to use a drop-down menu. What are the rules governing such knowledge transfer? Here we offer a formal Bayesian account of generalisation, in which observers update a hierarchical model that incorporates knowledge about the statistical moments of the distribution from which information is drawn. We use this model to predict performance on a foraging task that involved hunting for hidden rewards in a virtual two-dimensional grid environment. In this task, contextual cues signalled not only the likely reward location (bivariate mean), but also the pattern (bivariate dispersion). Observers optimally integrated noisy cues about the probable reward location with information from these cues.

2013,Acquiring Basic Skills in Changing Task Environments: Transfer of Working Memory Updating,"Acquiring new skills is not a set-in-stone process and students often take various paths to the goal; the acquisition of the required skill. To assess this learning process, previous studies used hidden Markov models to separate the cognitive stages of a problem solving task similar to solving algebraic equations (e.g. Anderson et al., 2012; Anderson, 2012). Because of the slow nature of fMRI recordings, this method can only discriminate between relatively long states in the process. This study extends the approach by including eye movements as a predictor of state, in an attempt to increase temporal resolution of the method. The results show that eye movements can be used to trace the characteristics of the problem the subject is working on. Because tracking eye movements is a non-invasive measure that can be used outside experimental settings, this can benefit the discovery of problems students encounter while solving algebraic problems.",>Trudy Buwalda>Aryn Pyke>Shawn  Betts>Niels Taatgen>John Anderson,>University of Groningen & Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>University of Groningen>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0710/index.html
2013,The representation of polysemous words in semantic and episodic memory,"Many controversies in cognitive science hinge around the divide between the general and the particular. In language research, the Declarative Procedural (DP) model proposes that procedural memory deals with the generalizable aspects of grammar, while exceptions are handled by declarative memories. Extending the DP model, we believe that the existence in memory of a semantic component which stores the prototypic information and an ‘episodic’ component that stores both the exceptions to the prototypes and the exceptionally common stimuli, could explain results on polysemia research. We studied the representation of polysemous words. We tested whether different senses of a polysemous word prime each other. Although in general there is no priming there are items showing positive priming and others showing inhibition. We then used bimodal priming in order to understand the effect of context in both types of items.

Yet beneath this linguistic variation there may lie universal cognitive tendencies. Khetarpal et al. (2010) found that speakers of Dutch and English, despite differences in their linguistic spatial systems, sorted spatial scenes similarly—and more like the finer-grained language, Dutch. We asked whether this preference for fine-grained sorting extends to two new languages: Máíhɨki, a language of Peruvian Amazonia, with a fine-grained spatial system, and Chichewa, a Bantu language of southeast Africa, with a coarse-grained spatial system. Despite the great range in spatial naming represented across these languages—both in the granularity and the shape of their spatial categories—we found that speakers of all four languages sorted finely, and thus similarly to the finer-grained languages, Máíhɨki and Dutch. These results suggest that spatial cognition, unlike spatial language, is universally fine-grained.",>Alexandra Carstensen>Grace Neveu>Lev Michael>Terry Regier,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0712/index.html

On the flip side, the person also must be able to differentiate among more detailed pieces of information. Adaptive functioning requires the coordination of both processes, where one can flexibly switch from integrated higher-order patterns to differentiated details and vice versa. What is the nature of this coordination? Through fractal and recurrence quantification analyses used in three visual tasks (search, matching and classification), we provide evidence that this coordination has properties of dynamical systems, modulated by task features.

English Competitor trials contained an item whose English name overlapped phonologically with the English name of the target (e.g., chair-chain); Spanish Competitor trials contained an item whose Spanish name overlapped phonologically with the Spanish name of the target (e.g., silla-silbato [chair-whistle]). Whereas all participants looked more often at English Competitor items than at items that did not overlap phonologically with the target, only the Spanish-English bilinguals looked more often at Spanish Competitor items.

2013,Understanding Emergent Phenomena with Functional Schema,"Previous research has well-documented that naïve learners struggle when attempting to understand emergent phenomena. Misconceptions often arise as learners tend to apply patterns of cause-and-effect between entities to explain these emergent processes. We posited that comprehending emergence requires learners to construct a different conceptual model, namely a functional schema, emphasizing functional relationships among entities and their interactions that are central to how emergent phenomena arise. A promising strategy to promote generation of such functional schema is contrasting examples. This paper reported an intervention study with 86 middle school students examining the effect of contrasting scenarios in helping learners generate a functional-relationship-centered schema to understand global warming. Students’ correct and misconceived explanations in pretest-posttest protocols were analyzed. Results showed contrasting scenarios motivated learners to develop the critical functional schema, which led to their eventual understanding of the mechanism of global warming. Implications on schema construction on understanding emergent systems are discussed.",>Margaret Chan,>Columbia University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0715/index.html
2013,Pedagogy and Technology: Balancing student-centric learning with teacher-centric teaching,"Technology can be used to create student-centric learning in diverse ways, including the use of social media platform(s) and interactive simulations to teach inductive thinking, and games to facilitate self-directed learning. But, teacher-centric teaching is important as student-centric learning is; both aspects contribute to the student learning process, although the former has hardly been considered explicitly. Specifically, while technology develops apace, that teachers might continue to prefer traditional teaching modes and styles is an issue that should not be taken lightly, because teaching performances can be compromised if these modes and styles were compelled to evolve prematurely. I will particularly discuss the apprehensions that teachers might have as a technology-based teaching culture rapidly emerges, and how the dissonance between (non-)preferred modes of teaching and learning in this context might be resolved, in order to promote a technology-enhanced education system that ultimately benefits both teachers and students in a practical way.",>Stephen Wee Hun Lim,>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0716/index.html
2013,Modelling Word and Object Naming in Pure Alexia,"Pure alexia (PA) is characterised by abnormally strong length effects in word reading times. It is often thought to result from damage to visual processing. This visual damage was also found to cause impaired object recognition performance (e.g., Roberts et al., 2012), suggesting a general visual deficit. Many computational models of reading have successfully simulated different forms of acquired dyslexia (e.g., Coltheart et al., 2001; Plaut et al., 1996). However, an adequate computational account of pure alexia has yet to be produced. We developed a large-scale and complete connectionist model with asymmetric hemisphere processing to support both word and object recognition. When damage was applied to the left visual processing layer in the model, the model produced abnormal length effects and impaired object recognition similar to those seen in PA patients. The results provide evidence to support the view of a common visual processing in visual word recognition.",>Ya-Ning Chang>Matthew Lambon Ralph>Steve Furber>Stephen Welbourne,">Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit, University of Manchester>Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit, University of Manchester>Advanced Processor Technologies Group, University of Manchester>Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit, University of Manchester",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0717/index.html
2013,Masked Repetition Effects of Chinese Compound Words Interact with Word Frequency because of Properties of Compound,"Masked repetition has been suggested as the reliable paradigm investigating the pre-lexical processing of English words. This suggestion has the supportive evidence that masked repetition effects do not interact with word frequency. Chinese compound words are the combinations of two constituent characters which have independent lexical properties. The lemma model argues that the lemmas of constituents would increase masked repetition effects of low-frequency compound word when the constituent characters have relative higher frequency. To verify this argument, this study manipulated the frequency and the morphological aspects of constituent characters. The critical results are the increased masked repetition effect of low-frequency coordinative words which have at least one high-frequency characters and the null interaction of masked repetition effect and word frequency for the compound words having meaningless constituents. The approaches to modify the current lemma model are discussed according to these findings.",>Sau-Chin Chen>Zi-Han Chen,">Department of Human Development, Tzu-Chi University, Taiwan>Department of Human Development, Tzu-Chi University, Taiwan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0718/index.html

2013,The construal level theory and the dual process theory in multi-attribute decision making: An empirical examination,"The compromise effect and attraction effect are examples of irrational choice in multi-attribute decision making. Their underlying mechanisms are assumed to be differences in the trade-off structure of each choice set. Recent research on the construal level theory showed that a high construal level decreases the compromise effect, but increases the attraction effect. Further, studies on the dual process theory showed that the depletion of participants’ cognitive resources increases the attraction effect, but eliminates the compromise effect. It is therefore important to examine compensatory (or uncompensatory) information search based on trade-off structure in these context effects. We examined the influence of the construal level of participants’ choices and the depletion of participants’ cognitive resources for the above two context effects.

2013,Beyond Berlyne’s Conjecture: The Aesthetic Quality of Visual Patterns,"Berlyne, the Canadian psychologist, famously conjectured that the aesthetic preference for visual patterns is an inverted-U function of their complexity. In my own research (Chipman, 1977), I developed and studied a large set of patterns, exploring what determined their judged complexity. These included patterns with several types of well defined structure, as well as randomly generated patterns. Several experiments explored the judged aesthetic quality of such patterns. Judged aesthetic quality was not any simple function of judged complexity. Not surprisingly, there are significant individual differences in aesthetic preference, including differences in preference for different types of visual structure.",>Susan Chipman,>unaffiliated,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0721/index.html
2013,Incremental Information Processing on Visual Search: The Critical Role of Delivery Rate,"Recent studies show that visual search is often not well characterized as either a purely parallel or serial search strategy. Subsequently, the literature and computational models have evolved from traditional parallel and serial descriptions to a continuum of search efficiency. It has been demonstrated that search efficiency does not improve with simultaneous delivery of target features in a conjunction-search task. Interestingly, search efficiency does improve when non-linguistic visual delivery of target features appears incrementally and concurrently with the display onset, but not prior to display onset. In our current experiment, we explore the temporal constraints of the facilitatory effect found with concurrent incremental information processing. The results explain that linguistic and non-linguistic mediation of visual search, provided sufficient time to process, is chiefly due to the incrementality of target feature delivery when search has begun. This finding supports an interactive account of visual attention.",>Eric Chiu>Michael Spivey,">University of California, Merced (UCM)>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0722/index.html
2013,From Logical Positivism to Philosophical Thinking: Impacts and Implications on the Student-Learning Process,"In schools today, students pursue individual academic subjects, such as physics, mathematics, and biology. By compartmentalizing these subjects, students may not be able to connect concepts from different disciplines competently to explain universal phenomena that occur in everyday living. Under this view, it is essential to inculcate an overarching philosophy with which one can capably unify all taught subjects. We first consider Logical Positivism as an overarching philosophy, and the benefits and implications of teaching it to students. We then illuminate the importance of inculcating broad-based philosophical thinking in students, and discuss how this pedagogical approach deepens students’ understanding in, and increases their interest towards, the subject matter that they learn, as well as trains students’ abilities to examine and interpret natural phenomena in logical ways.",>Dian Yi Chow>Stephen Wee Hun Lim,>Hwa Chong Institution (College)>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0723/index.html
2013,FOXP2 as the Genetic Basis for the Capacity to Shift Between Analytic and Associative Modes of Thought,"It was previously proposed that the burst of creativity in the Middle/Upper Paleolithic following the appearance of anatomically modern humans was due to the onset of contextual focus, the capacity to shift between an associative mode of thought conducive to forging connections and breaking out of a rut, and an analytic mode conducive to logical problem solving. Hominids could then generate ideas in an associative mode, and refine them in an analytic mode, and process representations at multiple levels of detail, and from different perspectives. This resulted in richer understandings of their world. It is proposed that the FOXP2 gene, which evolved at this time, is responsible for onset of contextual focus. FOXP2 thereby created an unprecedented need for language to (a) keep track of representations for oneself, and (b) capitalize on different perspectives of others. This explains why FOXP2 is implicated in language but not uniquely associated with it.",>Courtney Chrusch>Liane Gabora,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0724/index.html
2013,The roles of configuration and orthography in Chinese recognition: a developmental approach,"In Chinese, character configuration and orthographic combination are acknowledged to influence character recognition. Also, it was widely accepted that lexical access ability progresses as reading skills improved and vocabulary increased. The present study aims to reveal the effects of configuration type and radical properties by comparing different development stages of Chinese learning. A character decision task was used in which radical position-based frequency and radical position regularities within two different configurations were manipulated. 15 third-grade 27 sixth-grade schoolers, and 41 undergraduate students were asked to identify whether the 120 pseudo-words conform to radical position regularities. Accuracy was recorded as measurement to examine the effects of configuration and orthographic combination. The analysis revealed different patterns of frequency effect and regularity effect between the two configurations. Furthermore, age variation was observed for both types of configurations. In conclusion, orthographic and configuration knowledge are acquired gradually and play distinct roles in Chinese recognition.",>Yi-Ling Chung>Hsin-Hsuan Wu>Yu-Shu Chiang>Jon-Fan Hu>Chiu-Hua Huang>Hsueh-Chih Chen>Chien-Chih Tseng>Li-Yun Chang,>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University>National Taiwan Normal University>National Taiwan Normal University>University of Pittsburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0725/index.html
2013,Orthography and configuration on Chinese literacy acquisition: evidence from eye movement,"Previous research assumed the eye movement patterns change along with the growth of word knowledge while children become skilled readers. In this study, the effects of orthographic and configuration information on Chinese character recognition were investigated by comparing eye movement patterns from a developmental perspective (15 third-grade 27 sixth-grade schoolers, and 41 undergraduates). Eye movement patterns were recorded in a character decision task by varying configuration type (left-right, up-down), radical position-based frequencies (HH, HL, LH, LL), and radical position regularities (P, SN, WN). The results showed that the two different configurations lead to different eye movement patterns: (1) radical position regularity effect was only significant at the left-right configuration for all age groups; (2) frequency effect and development variation appeared for both two configuration types. These findings highlight the importance of configuration knowledge and orthographic awareness for learning Chinese characters.",>Yi-Ling Chung>Yu-Shu Chiang>Hsin-Hsuan Wu>Jon-Fan Hu>Chiu-Hua Huang>Hsueh-Chih Chen>Chien-Chih Tseng>Li-Yun Chang,>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University>National Taiwan Normal University>National Taiwan Normal University>University of Pittsburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0726/index.html
2013,"""You talkin' to me""? Understanding communicative intentions recruits the mirror and the mentalizing system","In our daily social interactions we can infer others people intentions from the observation of their actions. In general, two brain systems, the mentalizing and the mirror neuron system, have been implicated in understanding other’s intentions. However, there is little knowledge whether and how these two systems may cooperate in correctly understanding communicative interactions. We used functional MRI to establish how mirror and mentalizing regions contribute to the implicit encoding of communicative intentions, proposing that being directly involved during social interaction would be mediated by both systems. In particular, we investigated the involvement of those systems in distinguishing communicative from private intentions as well as other directed (“third-person perspective”) from self-directed (“second-person perspective”) intentions. Categorical and functional connectivity analyses showed that the mentalizing and the mirror neurons system were simultaneously involved in processing communicative intentions in general and more strongly coupled in self directed communicative actions.",>Angela Ciaramidaro>Cristina Becchio>Livia Colle>Bruno Bara>Henrik Walter,>University of Frankfurt>University of Turin>University of Turin>University of Turin>Charité University of Berlin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0727/index.html

Participants were given the task to identify the operation of virtual '""computer chips"" by setting the value of various components and observing how those interventions influenced the setting of other components. Across conditions we manipulate the complexity of the causal system (i.e., number of nodes and connections), the number of alternative hypotheses (i.e. possible causal graphs) on each trial, and aspects of the ""temporal stability"" of the learning environment (if repeated interventions were made on a single, stationary system or if the system reset to different starting states following each intervention). Interventions were modeled by comparing them to an optimal Bayesian learner who chooses interventions to quickly reduce uncertainty about the structure.

2013,Individual differences in shape bias are predicted by non-linguistic perceptual ability,"Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) lag behind peers with typical language (TL) in vocabulary. We ask what impact this lag has on shape bias (generalization based on shape in Naming contexts [“here’s a dax; find another dax”] but not Classification contexts [“look at this; find another like this”). Smith (2000) argues that shape bias depends on and drives vocabulary development; vocabulary is a basis for detecting covariation between objects and names, and name learning accelerates once the bias emerges. 51 three and four year-old children (16 SLI, 16 matched TL, 19 additional TL) participated in Naming and Classification tasks, a paired visual association (PVA) task, and an assessment battery. The SLI group was significantly worse at PVA and did not exhibit a shape bias. Individual differences revealed wide variation in both groups, and that shape choices in Naming were better predicted by PVA than standardized assessments.",>Beverly Collisson>Bernard Grela>Tammie Spaulding>Jay Rueckl>James Magnuson,>University of Calgary>University of Connecticut>University of Connecticut>University of Connecticut and Haskins Laboratories>University of Connecticut and Haskins Laboratories,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0729/index.html

Participants (N=31) judged which of two cars would go faster when the underlying rule was plausible or implausible and when two response choices differed with respect to one or two causal variables. Participants completed 300 trials in five blocks. We found an interaction between trial type, block, and plausibility of rule. In earlier trials in the implausible rule condition, there was greater deviation towards the distracter response before selecting the correct response. Participants given implausible rules demonstrated less activation of competing representations over time as they induced the underlying rules, particularly on trials in which response choices differed on both causal variables. Mouse trajectories did not change across blocks for participants given the plausible rule, suggesting they learned the rule early.",>Steve Croker>Corinne Zimmerman,">Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois, USA>Illinois State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0730/index.html
2013,Where is the insight in insight problems?,"Insightful problem solving is a vital part of human thinking, yet very difficult to grasp. The “Aha! experience” is often regarded as the defining characteristic of insight. Traditionally, insight has been investigated by using a set of established “insight tasks”, assuming that insight has taken place if these problems are solved. However, the debate about which problems actually trigger insight is still not resolved, since there is no clear behavioural marker for the occurrence of insight. In the present work, we therefore aimed at testing the validity of three classical insight problems by directly asking participants about their solution experiences. Our results suggest that participants solve insight problems also without any Aha! experience, casting doubt on the common approach of using a priori defined insight problems. Consequently, we advocate the use of direct insight ratings by participants, determining for each problem individually whether it was solved with insight or not.",>Amory H.

In this research, eye tracking and verbal protocols were gathered as 26 pre-service teachers used a graphical overview or keyword interface to choose online resources for an educational task. Fixation times and pupil diameter were analyzed as measures of cognitive effort; results demonstrated that pupil diameter was significantly lower when participants used the graphical as compared to the keyword interface. Protocol analysis was used to examine the depth of processing during search and evaluation; results showed that participants using the graphical overview engaged in deeper analysis of domain content.

2013,Cultural Variation in Families’ Shared Engagement,"Cultural Variation in Families’ Shared Engagement This study examines whether Indigenous-heritage Mayan mothers and their young children are more likely than middle-class European American mothers and their children to engage by blending agendas in fluid collaboration while exploring novel objects together. Fluid collaboration appears to be encouraged in many Indigenous communities of the Americas, where children often collaborate in ongoing family and community endeavors (Rogoff, 2003; Mozier & Rogoff, 1993, 2003). The present research submits audio signals of videotaped observations of mothers and their children in home interactions to micro-analysis using spectrographs, to compare the interactions of Mayan and European American families (Gratier, 2003, 2013; Malloch, 1999; Trevarthen, 2008). In the visual representations of their vocalizations, we find evidence that the Mayan families more frequently use smooth collaboration whereas the middle-class European American families appear to struggle more to establish a shared rhythm in their interactions.",>Andrew Dayton>Barbara Rogoff,">University of California Santa Cruz>University of California, Santa Cruz",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0733/index.html

Because little is known about the visual tuning properties of processes involved in action recognition, we examined the visual tuning properties of action recognition by means of a behavioral adaptation paradigm. Participants were adapted to images showing a person hitting or waving and subsequently categorized test images showing an ambiguous action as either hitting or waving. We found the perception of the test images to be significantly biased away from the adapted action (action adaptation aftereffect (AAA)). Subsequent experiments ruled out that the AAA was not merely driven by the adaptation of local visual contrast or the emotional content of the action. However adaptation to action words (e.g. “hitting” or “waving”) did not induce an AAA. Finally we found evidence for the AAA being modulated by the social context in which an action is embedded, suggesting high level influences on action recognition.",>Stephan de la Rosa>Stephan Streuber>Martin Giese>Heinrich Bülthoff>Cristobal Curio,">Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics>Centre for Integrated Neuroscience at the University of Tübingen>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0734/index.html

The issue of why category learning causes one type of effect or the other has not been systematically investigated, but previous research suggests that highly discriminable stimuli may tend to produce compression while stimuli that are difficult to discriminate may tend to produce expansion. We report a series of studies testing the effect of stimulus discriminability on the type of learned CP effect produced using both similarity and XAB measures of the effects.

2013,Limits in Reasoning about False Beliefs in Adults: the Effect of Priming or the Curse of Knowledge?,"Birch & Bloom (2007, Psych. Sc. 18, 382-386) suggest that adults' reasoning about others’ mental states is influenced by their privileged knowledge about reality. When asked where a person described in the story would search for a missing object, subjects tend to judge with higher probability that the person would search in a particular box, when they know that the object is indeed in that box. However, the results of their experiment could be an effect of unintended priming in the materials, i.e., the increased attention towards the box might be also caused by reading about it in the task instructions. In a new version of the experiment, we controlled for this factor by priming different locations in the instructions. The results show that it is unlikely that priming is the source of the Birch and Bloom's observations: only knowledge about reality changes the strategies in reasoning about others’ actions.",>Agnieszka Dębska>Krystyna Komorowska,>University of Warsaw>University of Warsaw,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0736/index.html
2013,Agency and attention influence the perceived speed of a moving stimulus,"The sensory consequences of intentional actions are perceived to be attenuated compared to equivalent but externally generated stimuli. It is thought that forward models in the sensorimotor system partially cancel predictable reafferent sensory feedback in order to bias attention towards more novel or unexpected stimuli. But does merely observing familiar actions also trigger forward models with attendant sensory attenuation? Previous studies investigated this question in the auditory modality with conflicting results. We conducted two attenuation experiments in a visual modality to conceptually replicate and generalize previous findings (Exp 1), and to control for differences in temporal predictability and attention which may have confounded previous studies (Exp 2). We found that movements initiated by humans (self or other) were attenuated compared to computer movements, and self-initiated movements were the most attenuated. Adding Go signals prior to movements counteracted attenuation.

We speculated that the salience of the external information is crucial in causal inference. The external information did not affect the causal inference when the external information and the covariation data were simultaneously presented in Experiment 1. However, when the external information and the covariation data were sequentially presented and participants were asked to report the causal structure and the strength each time in Experiments 2 and 3, participants were more likely to report the causal structure of the external information when the covariation data were drawn from a different causal structure. Results of the three experiments showed that the external information can override the covariation data under certain conditions.",>Kyung Soo Do>Rae-yeop Park,">Sungkyunkwan University, KOREA>Sungkyunkwan University, KOREA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0738/index.html
2013,Do voices survive lexical consolidation?,"Learning new words involves consolidation. After one night's sleep, not only is explicit knowledge about the novel words enhanced, but the new words also now compete with similar-sounding existing words (Dumay & Gaskell, 2007) during word recognition. The present study assessed whether lexical consolidation strips off surface details of newly learned words, producing more abstract representations. We manipulated the speaker's voice between exposure and test. Participants learnt one set of novel competitors (such as 'shadowks' for 'shadow') seven days before the test, and another set immediately before the test. Each word was learnt in a male or a female voice, and was tested in either the same or the other voice. Cued recall and phoneme monitoring showed stronger memory for the seven-day old items and, if anything, an enhanced voice effect (i.e., better performance in the same voice condition) after seven days. Crucially, our most indirect measure of lexical competition showed that only the seven-day old items (as expected) engaged in lexical competition, but only when the input preserved the voice in which they had been encoded. These findings indicate that consolidation does not make word representations more abstract: voice specific details do not just survive lexical consolidation; they are enhanced by it.",>Nicolas Dumay>Jeffrey Bowers,">Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language>University of Bristol, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0739/index.html
2013,External Normalization: Testing a Cognitive Offloading Account,"When individuals are presented with complex arrays at non-canonical orientations (e.g., rotated text) they frequently physically rotate to approximate the orientation of the stimulus (i.e., external normalization). One view of this natural behavior is that individuals are offloading internal cognitive demands (e.g., internal normalization) by adopting an external solution (i.e., external normalization). We test this account here by combining a stimulus rotation manipulation with a stimulus repetition manipulation. Previous research has demonstrated that stimulus repetition reduces the cost of stimulus rotation on performance. In other words, repetition putatively reduces the “internal” costs of stimulus rotation. Thus, stimulus repetition should reduce the frequency of external normalization. Consistent with the cognitive offloading account, repetition reduced the frequency of spontaneous physical head rotations while individuals read rotated text. Discussion focuses on the implication of these results for understanding cognitive offloading and the embodied and embedded nature of cognition.",>Timothy Dunn>Srdan Medimorec>Evan Risko,">University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, United States>Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States>University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0740/index.html

For instance, it is proposed that when people use multiple cues to make a probabilistic inference about a criterion, they sometimes rely on simple heuristics and sometimes apply more elaborate additive strategies. Indeed, many studies suggest that people’s inferences can be described by different strategies in different situations. However, critics of this view suggest that people do not apply different strategies but instead adjust one single strategy to the characteristics of each situation. Here we examine the strategies that individuals use when available resources change. Therefore, we continuously change the cost of deliberation time. The behavior of participants at the transition from fast and simple behavior to slow but optimal information integration offers insight into whether people select different strategies or continuously adjust one single strategy.",>Gilles Dutilh>Benjamin Scheibehenne>Han L.

For example, the literature suggests that people perceive direct speech as more vivid and perceptually engaging than indirect speech. We sought to address how this alleged vividness is evident in comprehenders’ mental representations in a series of experiments. Our results do not support the idea that, compared to indirect speech, direct speech enhances the accessibility of information from the communicative or referential situation during comprehension. Neither do our results support the idea that the hypothesized more vivid experience of direct speech is caused by switching from the visual to the auditory modality. However, our results do show that direct speech leads to a stronger mental representation of the exact wording of a sentence than does indirect speech.

Evidence from category learning suggests that explanation may drive the learner to identify underlying regularities that fit a general pattern (Williams & Lombrozo, 2010). In a pilot study, we examined whether explanation could be used to improve understanding of fraction magnitudes and whether explanations of specific inequalities are more or less effective than explanations of sets of inequalities. Results revealed that generating single or set explanations did not affect test or transfer accuracy, but individuals indicated strong and consistent preferences for particular types of explanations (i.e. conceptual, procedural, or rule-based). Further studies are being conducted to identify individual differences that may predict preferences for different kinds of explanations and their effect on subsequent learning and understanding.",>Emma H.

2013,Language and Spatial Attention: Words Evoke Independent Codes for Objects and Locations,"Many common words have spatial associations (e.g., “bird,” “snake,” “jump”, “crawl”) that influence perception at congruent and incongruent locations. For example, “bird” hinders identification of a square at the top of a display. Many researchers have attributed this spatial interference to location-specific perceptual simulations: The word “bird” shifts attention upward and evokes the perceptual representation of a bird, which impairs identification of an unrelated visual target either by visually masking it or by engaging the neural systems necessary for visual perception. However, we report that a large sample of nouns (Experiment 1) and verbs (Experiment 2) of high and low imageability (and visual strength) elicited equivalent spatial interference. Thus, perceptual simulation failed to explain the spatial interference effect. Experiment 3 instead supported an event coding explanation: Target objects are coded for their congruence with both the cue word and its implied location, and conflicting codes interfere with responding.",>Zachary Estes>Michelle Verges>James S.

We here report on an experiment which closely follows the original study (albeit in computerized form and with a Singaporean population), with additional elements aimed at explicating the causal structure and temporal dynamics of the underlying processes. Contrary to intuition, we find that subjects who notice and immediately report a “manipulation” trial still miss about half of subsequent manipulation trials. Detection is also found to be highly sensitive to the form and timing of the opportunities to report. We also investigate the effects of choice manipulation on attractiveness ratings, finding that manipulations do modulate subsequent attractiveness ratings but that this effect falls below significance after a 2-week interval.",>Ilya Farber>Fumihiko Taya>Swati Gupta>O'Dhaniel Mullette-Gillman,">Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR>SINAPSE Institute for Cognitive Science and Neurotechnologies, National University of Singapore>Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR>Department of Psychology and SINAPSE Institute for Cognitive Science and Neurotechnologies, National University of Singapore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0745/index.html
2013,Perceptual Word-Form Typicality Effects Are Modulated by Strength of Expectation During Reading,"A growing literature suggests that readers generate predictions about various aspects of incoming linguistic input. Do expectations from context map onto lower-level expectations, and if so, how? We propose that comprehenders use internally generated predictions to explain the source of the input. In two experiments, we tracked eye-movements as subjects read sentences that generated strong (The boy saved the xxx) or weak (Mary had the word “xxx” tattooed …) expectations for nouns. Across contexts, subjects encountered target words (xxx) that had visual-form features that were either typical or atypical of nouns. In strongly predictive contexts, first-fixation and gaze duration measures were longer when the form of the target word was atypical with respect to the predicted category. In the less-biased contexts, no effect of word-form typicality occurred. These experiments provide eye-movement evidence that linguistic context is used to generate perceptual expectations about form-based properties of upcoming words during reading.",>Thomas Farmer>Klinton Bicknell>Michael Tanenhaus,">Department of Psychology, University of Iowa>Department of Psychology, University of California-San Diego>Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of Rochester",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0746/index.html

In prior work we have demonstrated that semantic similarity influences even early morphological priming (Feldman, Kostić, Gvozdenović, O’Connor, & Martín, 2012; Feldman & Martín, 2009). In two experiments conducted in English, we used a forward-masked lexical decision task to assess whether processing differs after exhaustively decomposable (stem+affix; e.g., pastor-PAST) and partially decomposable (stem+nonmorphemic string; e.g., pasta-PAST) primes in semantically dissimilar prime-target pairs. Results using linear mixed effect models on inverse transformed (-1000/RT) latency data with two separate PCs for the contributions of form (negative) and for frequency (negative) and previous RT as a predictor, failed to show different patterns of facilitation after exhaustively and partially decomposable primes; both of which differed from unrelated controls.

This research examined the extent to which the format of feedback in an online learning environment impacts students’ processes and outcomes during a self-regulated learning task. Students wrote scientific essays that were analyzed by a personalized learning service (the customized learning service for conceptual knowledge: CLICK). Feedback on essay content was presented using either a visual (node-link) representation or a (text-based) list view. Preliminary data reveal that learners presented with the visually-based feedback engaged in more effective self-regulated learning processes (i.e., planning and goal-setting) compared to learners provided with list-based feedback.

Parent-child pairs (n=16, m child age 4;1) viewed identical complex spatial arrays on separate computer screens. Parents were asked to describe target objects so that their child could identify them on their own screen. Children’s knowledge of left/right was independently tested using a comprehension task. A hierarchical statistical model of the experimentally elicited spatial language predicted that the probability of parents using left/right was greater for children that achieved higher comprehension scores, indicating successful communicative adaptation. This result did not hold for parents of children with severe spatial impairments (Williams Syndrome), suggesting that there is considerable variation in how well parents tune their language to their children’s level of spatial language and knowledge.",>Katrina Ferrara>Colin Wilson>Katherine Kelliher>Malena Silva>Barbara Landau,">Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, US>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, US>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, US>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, US>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, US",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0750/index.html
2013,Using Graphical Organizers to Improve Self-Regulated Learning: Constructive Activities Enhance Deep Learning with Online Materials,"The interactivity framework (Chi, 2009) proposes learners experience greater learning benefits as they become more generative with learning material. This research investigated the active-constructive-interactive framework in the context of graphical organizers before a self-regulated, online learning task. Graphical displays were node-link diagrams, where nodes identified important domain concepts and link labels described the relationship between concepts. Conditions examined: passive (in which nodes and links were provided); active (in which nodes were provided and learners revealed link labels on demand); and constructive (in which nodes were provided and learners generated link labels). Findings were consistent with the interactivity framework for constructive learners, who integrated more concepts into posttest concept maps and included more deep (relational/causal) statements in their posttest essays. However, there were no significant differences for passive and active conditions. Results demonstrate that constructive activities may be necessary to support deeper learning outcomes in activities used before self-directed learning tasks.",>Lisa A. Ferrara>Kirsten R.

2013,Constant entropy rate and related hypotheses versus real language.,"Constant entropy rate (CER) and uniform information density (UID) are two hypotheses that have been put forward to explain a wide rage of linguistic phenomena. However, the concrete definition of these hypotheses is unclear for statistical research and a direct and in-depth evaluation of these hypotheses from their definition is missing to our knowledge. Here we consider four operational definitions of UID: full UID (UID holding for any combination of elements making the utterances), strong UID (UID holding for any utterance that has non-zero probability) and initial UID (strong UID holding for utterances beginning with a particular element). Here we examine the logical dependencies between these hypotheses. The comparison of the assumptions and predictions of these hypothesis with Hilberg's law and other statistical properties of real human language indicates that CER and related hypotheses are qualitative different from actual language and suggests that these hypotheses are incomplete and must be revised.",>Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho>Lukasz Debowski,>Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya>Polish Academy of Sciences,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0752/index.html
2013,The origins of analogy,"We investigated the origins of analogical ability in 7-month-old infants, using the simplest and most basic relation – that of sameness and difference between two things. Experiment 1 showed infants were unable to detect and generalize these relations from a single exemplar (as suggested in Tyrrell et al., 1991). Experiment 2 used a habituation-dishabituation paradigm and found that infants could generalize the same-different relation to novel objects with six to nine training trials. Experiment 3 demonstrated that labels influenced performance: labeling the relation enhanced performance, but labeling the individual objects hindered performance. In addition, we varied infants’ prior experience with the objects and found signatures of relational learning have continuity across development. In summary, abstraction of relations can be facilitated by comparison across exemplars, disrupted by the saliency of individual objects, and manipulated by labeling. These findings are discussed in light of recent debates about phylogenetic continuity in relational abilities.",>Alissa Ferry>Susan Hespos>Yin-Juei Chang>Emily Hollenbeck>Dedre Gentner,>Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0753/index.html
2013,Using Xbox Kinect to explore spatial-numerical association of arm movements in parity judgments.,"Spatial-numerical associations were initially studied using chronometric methods to reveal the orientation of the mental number line (SNARC effect; Dehaene, Bossini, and Giraux, 1993). Recent evidence has shown that unconstrained spatial movements can be valuable in the study of embodied number representations (Fischer and Campens, 2009). We used the Xbox Kinect to record arm movements in a parity judgment task. We replicated SNARC in the horizontal dimension and found a similar trend in the vertical dimension. Movement amplitudes were also affected by number magnitude. Together, these results generalize evidence for the mental number line to everyday behaviors and suggest that natural user interfaces (NUI) can be used to study embodied cognition.",>Yariv Festman>Oliver Lindemann>Martin Fischer,>University of Potsdam>University of Potsdam>University of Potsdam,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0754/index.html
2013,From Complex to Collaborative Problem Solving,"Research on human problem solving may be about to face a conceptual change from individual to collaborative problem solving. Many challenging problems in the real world are solved by groups or teams. This is increasingly recognized by the problem solving research community, which traditionally has emphasized cognitive processes in individual problem solving. In this paper we argue how approaches for investigating complex problem solving can be conceptually extended towards collaborative problems solving. We will present several current examples of how to measure collaborative processes in a standardized way. One example is the InBox HD, a computer-based in-basket simulation with collaborative elements. The second example is the scenario Product Planning, implemented in the ColPS HD framework, which involves chat-based human-to-agent communication. We will elaborate on how these tools can be used to emulate realistic collaborative processes in the standardized setting of a psychological laboratory and indicate directions for future developments.",>Andreas Fischer>Daniel Holt>Julia Hilse>Joachim Funke,">Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany>Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany>Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany>Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0755/index.html
2013,Toddler’s understanding of false beliefs about object identity,"Children solve explicit false belief (FB) tasks around age 4 but implicit tasks (e.g. helping) in infancy (e.g. Buttelmann et al., 2009). Nativist accounts claim early conceptual competence, masked by performance factors (e.g. Leslie, 2005); sceptical accounts deny competence before age 4 (Perner & Ruffmann, 2005). A recent two-system-theory (Apperly & Butterfill, 2009) provides an alternative explanation: an early mindreading-system (1) tracks simple forms of mental states and a later flexible capacity (2) allows cognitively demanding inferences based on a fully-developed concept of belief. Because system 1 operates on relational rather than propositional attitudes it has clear flexibility-limits: it can represent FB’s about object location but not FB’s about identity. We contrasted 2.5-year-olds’ helping behavior in a 2 (identity/location) X 2 (false/true belief) design. Results suggest limited performance in the identity compared to the location task. Implications of this finding are discussed and follow-up studies will be presented.",>Ella Fizke>Stephen Butterfill>Hannes Rakoczy,">Institute of Psychology & Courant Research Centre „Evolution of Social Behaviour“, University of Göttingen, Germany>Department of Philosophy, University of Warwick, UK>Institute of Psychology & Courant Research Centre „Evolution of Social Behaviour“, University of Göttingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0756/index.html

Based on a paradigm of Vidal & Berthoz, a virtual tube system providing a highly controlled environment, we designed a study comparing 3d pointing performance (i.e., pointing backward to the starting point or pointing forward to the end point of the experienced route) following active (drivers) vs. passive (passengers) exploration. Furthermore, we assessed the individual memory strategies reflected in self-reports and related these to pointing performance and reaction times.",>Julia Frankenstein>Christoph Hölscher,">Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany>Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0757/index.html

However, it has proven difficult to quantify and explain this oddness of speech by employing traditional statistics methods. In this study we employ Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to investigate the temporal dynamics of voice in three mental disorders. We elicited monological descriptions of short videos in patients with schizophrenia, depression and Asperger's, as well as in related matched controls. We applied RQA to fundamental frequency, speech pause sequences and speech rate. The Rqa indexes (trend and entropy in particular) enable us to quantify and automatically discriminate between populations with >85% of accuracy, highlighting distinctive voice dynamics in each diagnoses.",>Riccardo Fusaroli>Kristian Tylén>Arndis Simonsen>Ethan Weed,">Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark>Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark>Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark>Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0758/index.html

2013,Completing the Puzzle: Online Processing during Novel Noun Generalization,"When building a lexicon, young children must first learn individual word-object mappings and subsequently extend these mappings to new category instances. Recent methodological advances demonstrate that processing efficiency during the initial mapping process increases between 15 and 24 months-of-age. The current study investigates real-time processing during the second word learning step, generalization. Using a head-mounted eye-tracker, 18-month old children completed a novel noun generalization task with novel solid objects. Many participants generalized names for solid objects based on similarity in shape rather than similarity in material. The addition of eye-tracking data in the current study reveals children’s comparison of test and exemplar objects both before and after novel name presentation. Integrating eye-tracking data with measures of vocabulary knowledge can elucidate how vocabulary organization speeds the generalization decision. Future work will manipulate syntactic context to examine how children’s knowledge of count and mass nouns further influences the generalization decision process.",>Megan Galligan>Larissa Samuelson,>University of Iowa>University of Iowa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0760/index.html
2013,Bilingualism change axonal structural network organization,"How the brain deals with more than one language and whether we need different or extra brain language sub-networks to support more than one language is unanswered question. Here, we investigate structural brain network differences between early bilinguals and monolinguals. Using diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) tractography techniques and a network-based statistic (NBS) procedure (Zalesky et al., 2010), we found two structural sub-networks more connected by white matter (WM) tracts in bilinguals than in monolingual; confirming WM brain plasticity in bilinguals (Luk et al., 2011; Mohades et al., 2012; Schlegel et al., 2012). One of these sub-networks comprises left frontal and parietal/temporal regions, while the other comprises left occipital and parietal/temporal regions and also the right superior frontal gyrus. Most of these regions have been related to language processing and monitoring (Abutalebi and Green, 2007); suggesting that bilinguals developed specialized language sub-networks to deal with the two languages. Additionally, a complex network analysis showed that these sub-networks are more graph-efficient in bilinguals than monolinguals and these increase seems to be at the expense of a decrease in whole network graph-efficiency.",>Lorna Garcia Penton>Alejandro Perez Fernandez>Yasser Iturria-Medina>Manuel Carreiras,">Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL), Donostia, Guipuzcoa, Spain>Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL), Donostia, Guipuzcoa, Spain>Cuban Neuroscience Center (CNC), La Habana, Cuba.>Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL), Donostia, Guipuzcoa, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0761/index.html
2013,Infants’ ability to discriminate between statements and questions,"Children must distinguish between statements and questions in order to accurately acquire language, but it is unclear when or how they do it. Experiment 1 examined whether prosodic characteristics of infant-directed questions and statements could differentiate them. Statements and yes/no questions differed on several dimensions, but statements and wh-questions did not. Experiment 2 tested whether 11-13-month-olds could nevertheless distinguish sentence types using lexical information. Half the infants were familiarized to statements, the remainder to questions. All infants were tested on new sentences of both types. Sentences were resynthesized to have monotone pitch and matched utterance-final vowel length, neutralizing any prosodic differences. Overall, there was a significant novelty preference and no interaction of trial type with familiarization type. Thus, while prosody is insufficient for distinguishing wh-questions from statements, by 11-months infants can use word order to distinguish statements and questions. This ability could provide an important foundation for acquiring syntactic knowledge.",>Susan Geffen>Toben Mintz,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0762/index.html
2013,Neural Correlates of Perceiving Dyadic Social Interactions,"The aim of the present study was to determine the differential contributions of the action observation network (AON) and the social neural network (SNN) to the experience of naturalness in observed dyadic social interactions. To this end, we used short animation sequences displaying social interactions between two virtual characters and systematically manipulated kinematic features of the social dynamics. A group of 21 male participants rated the “naturalness” of the observed scenes on a four-point scale while undergoing fMRI. Using the ratings of each participant as a parametric modulation of their general neural response to the stimuli, we found that an increase in naturalness experience was associated with higher activations in the AON. The SNN was preferentially recruited with a decrease in naturalness experience. This indicates that understanding familiar interactions involves an automatic kinematic processing of intentionality, while interactions perceived as artificial require higher-level inferential processing.",>Alexandra Georgescu>Bojana Kuzmanovic>Natacha Santos>Ralf Tepest>Gary Bente>Marc Tittgemeyer>Kai Vogeley,">University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany>University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany>University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany>University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany>Department of Psychology, University of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany>Max-Planck Institute for Neurological Research, Cologne, NRW, Germany>University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0763/index.html
2013,Imagined Effort Affects Object Localization and Sense of Agency,"Individuals who continually track an object that suddenly vanishes indicate perceived vanishing points displaced beyond the actual vanishing point (i.e., forward displacement: FD) (Hubbard, 1995). Jordan, Coey, and Tsippaaoutis (2009 ) demonstrated that FD increases with implied friction (i.e., low to high friction) if one controls stimulus movements. Metcalfe and Greene (2007) showed that manipulations of stimulus control affected judgments of agency. The present experiment examined the extent to which implied friction and conceptual factors (Reed & Vinson, 1996) affect feelings of agency during stimulus control. Participants controlled the movements of a trapezoidal stimulus labeled as either a “bullet train” or a “house” in two levels of implied friction. Results revealed a marginally-significant increase in FD with implied friction. Agency also varied significantly between implied friction conditions, but only when participants conceptualized the stimulus as a bullet train and implied friction decreased across blocks (i.e., implied effort became optimal).",>Devin Gill>J.

2013,The Role of Conceptual and Perceptual Information on Inductive Reasoning in Early Childhood,"There is an ongoing debate about the relative contribution of conceptual and perceptual information to inductive generalization in early childhood. In the classic study bearing on this debate, pictures representing familiar animals were arranged such that category membership was supposed to be in conflict with perceptual similarity. However, later studies revealed that most of the stimuli in this study failed to impose this conflict. The present study revisited this issue. Extensive calibration was conducted to ensure that the two sources of information were in conflict. Despite near-ceiling accuracy in identifying the category membership of objects used in the study (e.g., bird-bird-bat, dog-dog-cow, cat-cat-raccoon, etc.), 4-year-old children relied on their knowledge of category membership only 55% of the time when there was strong conflict between category membership and perceptual similarity.

2013,Perception and action effects on causal judgment,"Recent research suggests that perception and action affect performance on cognitive tasks (e.g., Beilock & Goldin-Meadow, 2010; Landy & Goldstone, 2007). Here we investigated perceptual and motor influences on causal judgment from contingency using a causal discounting paradigm (e.g., Goedert & Spellman, 2005). Participants learned about two potential causes of a common outcome on a trial by trial basis. We varied the left/right location of a target cause and the left/right location of the “yes” response button for predicting the cause would produce the outcome. When there was a mismatch between the target location and the “yes” response, participants discounted. However, they did not discount when the two locations matched. Thus, we observed more accurate causal judgment with spatial overlap in the perception and action information. These results are generally consistent with an embodied cognition framework; however, their exact mechanism remains to be explored.",>Kelly Goedert>Mengqi Guo,>Seton Hall University>Seton Hall University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0767/index.html
2013,Effects of Brief Analogical Training after Two-Week Delay,"There is considerable evidence that analogical comparison can foster STEM learning. For example, Gentner, Levine, Dhillon, & Poltermann (2009) used comparison to teach 6-8-year-old children an important engineering principle: namely, that a diagonal brace confers stability in construction. Children compared two buildings, one with a diagonal brace, and one with a horizontal (nonbracing) piece instead. After the comparison, children were shown an unstable building, and were given a piece to stabilize it. Children who received the comparison training were more likely to attempt to stabilize the building with a diagonal placement of the piece. We extended this research to (a) test for retention after two weeks and (b) examine effects of relational labeling (which has been theorized to support long-term retention) The results indicate that the training utilizing comparison and relational labeling elicited more diagonal placements both after a brief delay, and after a delay of two weeks.",>Micah Goldwater>Dedre Gentner,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0768/index.html

The underlying question has been whether one affects the other, usually within the scope of spatial language. Largely ignored is the possible role of bilingualism. Given that the average person speaks more than one language, and the mounting evidence showing that bilingualism interacts with non-linguistic processes (e.g., Bialystok & Senman, 2004), we investigated what effect bilingualism would have on non-linguistic spatial processing. We tested 120 participants with a range of linguistic abilities using four classic spatial tasks, e.g. mental rotation. We found patterns of systematic interaction between bilingualism and spatial processing. These findings raise questions beyond the relationship between spatial language and spatial cognition, suggesting that language as a cognitive process may share a common neural substrate with space.",>Monica Gonzalez-Marquez>Raymond Becker>James Cutting,>Cornell University>Bielefeld University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0769/index.html

In Experiments 2 and 3, we investigated whether categorization of the stimulus items would be facilitated by picture and environmental sound primes that were derived from different exemplars of the target items. The results demonstrated that the categorization of environmental sounds and pictures were facilitated in a similar way by conceptually related exemplars presented in advance, but only when a long inter-stimulus interval (1000 ms) was used. Additionally, conceptual cross-modal priming effects by picture and sound primes were asymmetric with systematic switch costs across modalities and with differences in the time-course of activation.",>Paula Goolkasian>Yongju Kim>Anne Marie Porter>Kathryn Weatherford,>UNC Charlotte>Korea Military Academy>UNC Charlotte>UNC Charlotte,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0770/index.html

(Tversky & Hard, 2009). What about seeing another person elicits an allocentric perspective? Participants were shown one of a variety of pictures displaying a book and cup placed, side-by-side, on a table. Some photos also pictured a man sitting behind the table, either facing the camera or facing to the left or right. Viewers were more likely to take the man’s perspective while describing object locations when the man was facing the camera than when the man was facing to either side. Many factors influence which perspective people take. These results suggest that the mere presence of a person in a scene does not guarantee a viewer will take someone else’s perspective, but rather the way a person is positioned in a scene might also be of critical importance.",>Michelle D.

Metacomprehension monitoring is presumed to be a critical skill for the effective self-regulation of study behaviors that impact learning. In two experiments, ecologically valid science texts and inference tests were employed to examine whether a test expectancy intervention could improve students’ metacognitive judgments, self-regulated study, and learning outcomes. Experiment 1 was a lab experiment in which test expectancies were instilled only after reading was complete, thus preventing any encoding effects. Results suggest that test expectancies impact metacomprehension monitoring accuracy via selection of more valid cues at the time of judgment rather than only via encoding effects that impact cue accessibility. Experiment 2 was a classroom study showing that the effect of test expectancies on monitoring accuracy translates into more effective self-regulated study and improved learning.",>Thomas Griffin>Jennifer Wiley>Keith Thiede,>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago>Boise State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0772/index.html

The paper checks empirically the prediction that Simpson’s paradox like effects are to be expected in this situation (Chater, Vlaev, & Grinberg, 2008). The existence of a bias for cooperation when playing with friends and for defection when playing with foes, is expected to lead to a reinforcement of cooperation based on higher average payoffs in the mixed condition, i.e. when playing with friends and foes together. At the same time, the average payoff for cooperation remains lower for games with friends and foes taken separately (Simpson’s paradox). There results of the experiment support the existence of such effects and suggest that further exploration is worthwhile.",>Maurice Grinberg>Stevan Tomic>Evgenia Hristova,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0773/index.html

Participants judged the degree of morality of actions on a scale from +100 (moral) through 0 (neither) to -100 (immoral). They judged the degree of morality for individual actions e.g., ‘a man intervened to stop a fight’, ‘a man gave blood’, and their conjunction, ‘a man intervened to stop a fight and he gave blood’. Most judgments were consistent, i.e. the conjunction was judged to be more moral or immoral than its components. However, a reliable number of judgments were inconsistent, i.e. the conjunction was judged to be less moral or immoral than one or both of its components. Consistency improved when participants read the conjunction after the conjuncts, compared to when they read it before. We discuss implications for understanding the mental representation of degrees of morality.",>Eoin Gubbins>Ruth Byrne>Phil Johnson-Laird,">Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland>Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland>New York University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0775/index.html

It is unclear if creativity consists of several different skills and abilities or if it is one core construct. It is also unclear to what extent creativity is influenced by culture and to what extent creativity constructs can be generalized across cultures. To investigate these questions, we administered three different creativity tests assessing fluency, originality, flexibility, and creative achievement to over 900 students in five countries: Germany, Guatemala, India, South Africa, and the United States. Results showed weak correlations between the different aspects of creativity speaking for heterogeneity of different creativity constructs, across all cultures.

2013,Exploration and Discovery in Children with Autism,"ASD is diagnosed by perseverative behaviors and social deficits. While ASD children’s selective interest in the physical world may lead to more extensive exploration (and learning) of physical objects, they may learn less due to their perseverative behavior. How is exploration affected in children with ASD? We quantified exploration and discovery as children with ASD (N=35, M=8.5 yrs) and their controls (N=35, age, IQ matched) explored a novel toy with hidden functions. ASD children showed more perseveration than controls on every measure, and the diversity of their actions was negatively correlated with severity of autism. Furthermore, ASD children discovered less hidden functions than controls. While the control group showed a marked decrease in perseveration with age, ASD group showed a heightened level of perseveration independent of age. These data suggest that children with ASD show marked difference in their exploration of the physical environment, and this difference has real consequences for learning and discovery.",>Hyowon Gweon>Hannah Pelton>Rebecca Saxe>Laura Schulz,>MIT>MIT>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0777/index.html
2013,Inferring mass in complex physical scenes via probabilistic simulation,"How do people learn underlying properties, such as mass and friction, from objects' interactions in complex scenes? Such inferences are difficult: the parameters cannot be directly observed and have nonlinear effects on the physical dynamics. Yet, people learn them. Participants predicted the stability of blocks stacked in complex tower configurations. After observing the true outcome, they answered, ""which blocks are heavier?"". Their responses indicate rapid learning of the blocks' relative masses. We view such learning as probabilistic inference in a generative model of Newtonian rigid-body dynamics, and express this hypothesis in a model observer that infers parameters using a procedure of approximate physical simulation. While participants' judgments qualitatively matched the model's, they also deviated in key ways that may be explained by resource limitations. This work advances our understanding of how people infer unobserved physical properties, and offers a framework for modeling such behavior in complex, real-world scenes.",>Jessica Hamrick>Peter Battaglia>Thomas Griffiths>Joshua Tenenbaum,">University of California, Berkeley>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of California, Berkeley>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0778/index.html

Two probabilistic computational models of expectation were trained: one on folksongs (General), the other on jazz (Bebop). Twenty-four melodies were selected whose final notes differed in Shannon entropy estimated by the two models. Listeners' uncertainty was assessed explicitly and inferred from expectedness ratings of different continuation tones. The analysis showed that jazz musicians followed 'Bebop' and non-musicians followed 'General'. Classical musicians showed some decoding of the jazz style, utilising a somewhat underdeveloped version of 'Bebop'. Moreover, experts experienced more salient prediction errors in low-entropy contexts, and musical skills predicted the extent of cognitive model optimisation. Our results suggest that expertise entails both possessing an accurate predictive model and selecting an optimal model for the given context.",>Niels Chr. Hansen>Niels Chr. Hansen>Niels Chr.

2013,"On the relationship between perceived foreigness, accentedness and speech comprehension under clear and adverse listening conditions","Social interaction involves the simultaneous uptake of a range of linguistic and nonlinguistic information. In a seminal study, Rubin (1992) has shown that a lecture spoken by a native speaker of Standard American English presented along with a photograph of an ethnically Asian instructor affected comprehension score and accentedness ratings more negatively as compared to the same lecture and speaker presented with a Caucasian instructor. Here we asked whether such effects could be observed in a multicultural environment, with a lot of interactions with different ethnicities and non-native speakers. Furthermore, we investigated how the effect could be modulated by the quality of the speech input (clear compared to noisy speech). The results showed that ethnicity affects accentedness ratings only under adverse listening conditions and that comprehension scores do not depend on ethnicity of the speaker. Thus, the effect of nonlinguistic information on linguistic processing is constrained in multicultural settings.",>Adriana Hanulikova>Frank Eisner,>University of Freiburg>MPI for Psycholinguistics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0780/index.html
2013,Understanding the Role of Context in Memory for Maximally Counterintuitive Concepts,"The effect of minimally counterintuitive information on memory is well established. However, less work has addressed the processing of maximally counterintuitive stories (i.e., stories containing at least three domain violations). The current study examined memory for maximally counterintuitive stories. The first two experiments investigated whether explicit instruction to make sense of “strange information” influenced memory for maximally counterintuitive stories. Although no such effect was observed, post hoc analyses indicated that the extent to which concepts in maximally counterintuitive stories contained domain violations from similar or different categories influenced memory performance; stories with similar domain violations enjoyed a memory advantage. The third study addressed the believability of concepts with similar domain violations with a rating task. Participants were more likely to agree with two counterintuitive concepts with similar domain violations compared to a single counterintuitive concept. The results are discussed within Upal's (2005; 2009) context-based view of memory for counterintuitive ideas.",>Mary Harmon-Vukic>M.

2013,The effect of goal reification on error rates while solving geometric problems,"An effective learning environment is designed to expose student misconceptions because, once explicit, they are available for remediation. How does one design such an environment, and what are the consequences for learning? In a previous study, we demonstrated that a significant revision to the Cognitive Tutor Geometry intelligent tutor had a generally positive effect on the speed of skill mastery (Hausmann & Vuong, 2012). However, the revised version demonstrated a higher error rate for easy skills. We hypothesized that the revised interface reified certain mental steps that students were previously allowed to complete implicitly. Specifically, students are now required to write an expression for the length of the side of a special right triangle before calculating the length. While the error rate for the calculation remained low (1.71%), writing the expression proved to be particularly difficult (13.93%). We contrast the evidence supporting this hypothesis with evidence for other potential explanations.",>Robert Hausmann>Annalies Vuong,">Carnegie Learning, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, United States>Carnegie Learning, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0782/index.html
2013,Real-Time Strategy: Multi-Level Dynamics in an Uncertain Environment,"As an agent gathers information about its environment and monitors the decisions of other agents, its behavior may fluctuate adaptively over short time scales while still maintaining a long-term strategy. We designed a real-time virtual environment to experimentally investigate the relationship between the micro-level dynamics of dyadic behavior within single games and the macro-level dynamics of outcomes across iterated games. In one experiment, participants played a real-time game of ""chicken,"" simultaneously guiding avatars toward high-payoff or low-payoff targets. If both participants reached a demarcated vicinity of a target at the same time, that target was destroyed. We recorded their trajectories, and induced uncertainty by adding noise to their movement speeds. At the macro-level, we found evidence of self-organized turn-taking across repeated games. At the micro-level, we found that even within a turn-taking equilibrium, both players competitively pursued the high payoff for a period of time before one of them diverted.",>Robert Hawkins>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0783/index.html
2013,Children’s understanding of lying related to intention.,"Children's conception of lies has been important issues for children's cognitive development. However, little is known about whether children's understanding of lies is different form adults' one. Four kinds of stories were presented for children aged 6- to 7- year olds and undergraduate students. First, a protagonist had a deceptive intention and produced a false statement. Second, he had a deceptive intention but produced a true statement by a false belief. Third, he had a truthful intention and produced a true statement. Fourth, he had a truthful intention but produced a false statement by a false belief. The results showed that undergraduate students judged that these protagonist's statements were lying or not by considering his intentions. By contrast, children judged regardless of his intentions. These results suggest that children's conception of lying is different from adults' one, and that their conception becomes sophisticated after middle childhood.",>Hajimu Hayashi,>Okayama University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0784/index.html
2013,Patient Knowledge and Satisfaction in Decisions About Lung Cancer Surgery,"Medical care is increasingly implementing shared decision making that requires participation of informed patients in an effort to maximize treatment-related decision satisfaction (DS). Patient comprehension of relevant information is important in decisions involving high risk and uncertainty, like surgery for lung cancer. Lung cancer patients (N=43) completed pre- and post-consult questionnaires, and their consults with the surgeon were audio recorded. Post consult knowledge was low (53%) while DS was moderately low (M=44.56, SD=13.71). Higher complication risk (rs = .34, P<.05), external locus of control (r = .31, P < .05), belief in a controlling deity (r = .37, P< .05), and desire for control (r = -.38, P < .016) predicted lower DS. Consult recordings showed that patients possess counterfactual beliefs, such as airborne spread of cancer in surgery, and benefit from removing most of the tumor.

2013,Baby physics: expectations about liquid and sand in 5-month-old infants,"Infants have expectations about physical properties of solid objects. However, evidence on infants’ understanding of nonsolid substances (e.g., water or sand) is sparse and equivocal. We conducted four habituation/dishabituation experiments demonstrating that 5-month-olds have distinct expectations for how objects and substances behave. Experiment 1 found that infants use motion cues from the surface of a contained liquid or solid to predict whether it would pass through or rest on a grid when the container was upended. Experiment 2 extended these findings to show that motion cues led to different expectations about whether a new object will pass through or remain on the top surface of a liquid or solid. Experiments 3 and 4 replaced the liquid with sand. We found that infants expected sand, like liquid, to go through a grid, but did not expect another object to pass through it.

2013,The timing of turns in mother-infant interactions: A Longitudinal Study,"Turn-transition in adult conversation is remarkably precise, with a median close to zero milliseconds. This means one needs to predict the end of their interlocutor’s turn to come in on time. The interaction engine hypothesis (Levinson, 2006) suggests the ability to appropriately time turns in social interaction is realized early in development, before and independent of language. Few studies have assessed timing of turn-taking in infant development. We analyzed video-recordings of 12 mother-infant dyads at 12 and 18 months in free-play interactions. Findings indicate that in the first half of the second year of life infants become more skilled in taking turns in vocal exchanges as evidenced by decreasing onset times of their turns (median = 700ms at 18 months) as well as a decrease in number of onsets produced in overlap with their mothers, which at 18 months is at the maternal level of overlapping onsets produced (20%).",>Elma Hilbrink>Merideth Gattis>Elena Sakkalou>Kate Ellis-Davies>Stephen Levinson,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Cardiff University>Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health>Cambridge University>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0787/index.html
2013,Working Memory and Abstract Representation in the Context of Culture,"As a species, humans stand out for superior cognitive capacities, including improved working memory and abstract representation. However, these abilities evolved, develop, and are generally utilized within a context of cultural transmission and ongoing interaction with the environment. This raises two complementary questions: To what extent does culture scaffold effective employment of our cognitive capacities, and to what extent is learning possible in culture’s absence? Experiment 1 demonstrates that participants given a verbal “hint” can use working memory to optimize rewards in a simple sequential learning task, whereas even after hundreds of trials of experience, those not given a hint can only learn the task suboptimally. Experiment 2 demonstrates similar results for hierarchical rule abstraction. In these experiments, hints are akin to cultural scaffolding, and their influence on learning helps identify how our ability to spontaneously leverage our unique cognitive capacities is limited in isolation from culture.",>Mark Ho>Fiery Cushman,">Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA>Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0788/index.html
2013,The Atoms of Cognition: Action Learning and Problem Solving,"In a previous paper we showed that a set of representations, which we referred to as “atomic operational representations,” which are explicit spatiotemporal representations, can perform the function of grounding concepts of activities and interactions in the physical world. In this paper, to demonstrate how these operational representations can function in cognitive processes, we develop the basic ideas further by showing 1) how actions and their consequences can be observed and captured in operational representations; 2) how causal rules of actions can be learned and encoded in the form of operational representations through an unsupervised causal learning process; and 3) how the learned causal rules can be used in problem solving processes that produce desired action plans. We show that the same representations can be used across the various levels of cognitive processing in a unified manner.

2013,Measuring the Use of Recognition with the Multinomial r-Model: An Application to Aging and Individual Differences,"It has been suggested that individuals use simple decision strategies for comparative judgments. According to the recognition heuristic (RH; Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 1999), people infer that a recognized object scores higher on a criterion, if one of two objects is recognized, but not the other. Hilbig, Erdfelder, and Pohl (2010) have argued that previous research lacked process-pure estimates of RH use and rigorous model testing and proposed the r-model, a multinomial processing tree (MPT) model. Addressing these methodological issues, we present a first MPT analysis of differences in RH use between younger and older adults. Model-based analyses indicated that in both age groups the RH was used adaptively more often in the environment with higher recognition cue validity (cities), as opposed to a domain with lower cue validity (diseases). The validity of further knowledge or recognition as decision cues did not differ between age groups. Moreover, we examined the model estimates on the individual level by applying a Bayesian hierarchical approach and compared these estimates with behavioral indices and measures derived from signal-detection theory. The resulting comparisons with standard RH-adherence rates indicated high correlations.

2013,Belief Updating in Moral Dilemmas,"Research on two classic moral dilemmas, Trolley and Footbridge, suggests that one’s past moral experiences can affect one’s subsequent moral decisions. These dilemmas have interested moral psychologists, in part, because they have found that people’s judgments about the dilemmas are affected by the order in which the dilemmas are considered. Furthermore, this effect is asymmetrical: people that consider Trolley after Footbridge have significantly different judgments than people in control conditions, but the converse is not true. We argue that this asymmetry is the result of a difference in how the each dilemma affects pre-existing beliefs regarding the importance of saving lives. In two experiments, we show that Footbridge disconfirms these beliefs, while Trolley does not significantly affect them. Consistent with predictions of a belief adjustment model of ordering effects, these findings offer a clear and parsimonious account of the asymmetry.",>Zach Horne>Derek Powell>Joseph Spino,">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of California, Los Angeles, California>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0791/index.html
2013,The effects of caregivers' instruction on children's learning in easy and difficult tasks,"Previous research has shown that gestures produced by caregivers and teachers facilitate children’s learning in problem-solving tasks. However, little is known about whether such facilitating effect varies with the task difficulty. We here asked twenty-eight three-year-old children to participate in two puzzle games (12-piece and 20-piece), with three episodes in each game. In Episodes 1 and 3, children played alone. In Episode 2, caregivers instructed their children (e.g., “Let’s put this piece upside down” while rotating left hand clockwise). For both puzzle games, children assembled more puzzles in Episode 3 than in Episode 1, suggesting that caregivers’ instructions were beneficial for children’s learning. However, such benefit was significantly greater in 12-piece than in 20-piece, t(27)=1.71, p<.05. This finding lends support to Vygotsky’s theory in which children can gain more from caregiver’s scaffolding when the task is within their capacity than when the task is beyond their capacity.",>Shumeng Hou>Zinnia Lam>Wing Chee So,">The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China>The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China>The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0792/index.html
2013,Are beliefs biased by logic? The effect of a secondary load and complexity on belief and logic based judgments.,"Dual-Process accounts claim that responses to reasoning tasks often default to automatically cued belief-based responses. However, recent findings show that when participants are instructed to evaluate the believability of a conclusion, its logical status interferes with their judgment. This finding is inconsistent with the view that belief based judgments are cued automatically. In this paper we present the results of three experiments that examined the impact of a secondary task (random number generation) on belief and validity judgments. Experiment 1 examined simple modus ponens arguments, experiment 2 included disjunctive syllogisms and experiment three employed a blocked presentation design. In line with previous research belief judgments took longer and resulted in more errors than validity judgments. However, in general, RNG impacted more on validity than belief based judgements.

2013,Comparison and explanation in learning: Children’s understanding of a basic engineering principle,"We investigated the roles of comparison and explanation in teaching children an important engineering principle – that triangular cross-bracing confers stability to structures. We aimed to discover how best to convey this principle to 4- and 6-year-olds and to reveal the cognitive mechanisms involved. Children either compared contrastive cases (a braced building vs. a non-braced building), received an explanation of the principle, or both, and were then tested on their ability to apply the principle to various contexts. We found that 4-year-olds benefited from comparison, but surprisingly did not benefit from a combination of comparison and explanation. 6-year-olds, however, benefited greatly from the combination, suggesting that more developed abilities are required to combine the two inputs. Performance on a mental transformation task was also related to successful brace placement.

Although it is known that the more universal a pattern is, the easier it will transfer to facilitate the formation of the representation, the role of markedness on such representation remains unclear. The current study tested two groups of Mandarin L2 learners, i.e., native speakers of English and Japanese with three levels of proficiency using the four structures in Mandarin: SVO, ba OV, S ba O V, and topicalization with novel verbs and neutral animacy cues in a forced choice paradigm to investigate what role of markedness plays in such representations. The results indicated that in addition to the initial transfer for the syntactic representation that is affected by learners’ L1 cue validity, the degree of markedness exerts impact on learners’ rate of acquisition of syntax at different levels.",>Dong-Bo Hsu,">National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan, Taiwan, R.O.C.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0796/index.html

In Phase 1 of the experiment, participants rated high-arousing words and neutral words for concreteness. In Phase 2, they made decision to determine if it was novel word (half high-arousing, half neutral). In Phase 3, they were told to value the features of Chinese words which were not presented previously in a 5-point Likert scale and finished some parts of the Basic Personality Inventory (BPI) for assessing and controlling possible cognitive processing bias.

2013,Categorization and recognition in a prototype-distortion task: ERP studies,"We used a prototype-distortion task and adopted ERPs to test between prototype and exemplar theories on categorization, which suggest that categories are represented as a prototype via an abstraction process or via storing previously encountered exemplars in memory, respectively. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were presented low- or high-distortion category-members (i.e., dot-patterns) without anticipating subsequent categorization or recognition test. They were more likely to process low-distortions via prototype abstraction in both tests, and differently process high-distortions via prototype abstraction in categorization test, but via storing exemplars in recognition test. In Experiment 3, participants were explicitly instructed to do categorization or recognition task. We found that participants did categorization test via prototype abstraction (N1) only for studied items, not for unstudied items. And conversely did recognition via familiarity processing (FN400) only for category-members, not for non-members.

In a mouse-tracking paradigm, participants responded yes or no to statements of varying truth-values such as ""A thousand is more than a million"" or ""English is a language"" as well as more ambiguous statements such as ""Murder is sometimes justifiable"". In the present study, we replicated these results along an 11-point continuum of truth-values, finding that the end-points of averaged mouse trajectories vary as a function of truth-value. In addition to this, negated versions of each stimulus were tested and revealed that truth-values for negated sentences follow more complex trajectories and do not preserve the original truth-value of the statement. The evidence found presents a problem for theories of negation that require a revision from the affirmative meaning.

2013,Exploring the boundary conditions of intentional forgetting,"The attempt to forget some recently encoded information can indeed cause later retrieval difficulties. However, such attempts are only effective when new information is learned shortly thereafter. In the present study, we asked whether the new information has to match the format of the to-be-forgotten information for forgetting effects to emerge. Participants studied words or line drawings (L1), and were afterwards instructed to remember or forget these items. Then, a second list (L2) was presented that either matched or mismatched the L1 format. Forgetting effects were only observed when the list formats matched. This result establishes an important boundary condition on intentional forgetting, and can be explained by the context change account (Sahakyan & Kelly, 2002), which assumes that forgetting occurs when retrieval is guided by temporal context only. Salient cues (such as differences in list format) allow for reinstatement of the L1 encoding context, thus eliminating forgetting.",>Almut Hupbach>Lili Sahakyan,>Lehigh University>The University of North Carolina at Greensboro,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0800/index.html
2013,"Purity and Disgust: Same Domain, or Separate Mechanisms?","We argue that much recent literature on disgust, dirtiness and purity has been guilty of conflating two evolved mechanisms: an oral disgust mechanism aimed at avoiding the ingestion of dangerous substances, and a self-grooming (cleanliness) mechanism aimed at eliminating ectoparasites from the skin. Though phylogenetically distinct, these two mechanisms become associated in human ontogeny due to their similar targets and overlapping image schemas: one focused on the mouth, the other on the body as a whole. We show that several puzzles in the literature on disgust and moral purity can be resolved using this model. The idea of contamination so central to purity norms may more plausibly be based on grooming responses to ectoparasites than on disgust responses to endoparasites. The disgust image schema may more easily be extended to moral judgements about others, while the cleanliness schema is more easily extended to judgements about the self, with interesting consequences.",>Gordon Ingram>Karolina Prochownik,">Bath Spa University, Bath, Somerset, England>Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0801/index.html

2013,Mental Process of Mindreading: Self and Stereotype as Anchors in Mental State Inference,"Capacities of mindreading are essential for human social life. It is hypothesized that people selectively use two types of mindreading strategies; when a target person is perceived to be similar to oneself, people project one’s own mental states to the person (projection): when the target is perceived to be dissimilar, category-based stereotype is used (stereotyping). In this study, we tested this hypothesis with the reaction time paradigm (e.g., Tamir & Mitchell, in press). Given that the both projection and stereotyping are computationally modeled as anchoring-and-adjustment processes, the reaction time paradigm can be used to detect a strategy used in mindreading. We found the stereotyping was unanimously employed independent of the similarity to the target person and projection was employed only when the perceived similarity was high. Our results are congruent with Tamir & Mitchell (in press) and confirmed the utility of the reaction time paradigm as a tool for investigating mindreading strategies.",>Tatsunori Ishii>Masanori Takezawa,">Tokyo Seitoku University, Tokyo, Japan>Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0803/index.html
2013,Eye-Movement Strategies in Multiple Target Search for Target Location and Uncertainty Reduction,"Where do people look when searching for multiple targets under time pressure: at salient targets, at locations with high uncertainty about target presence, or somewhere else? Preceding research suggests that people tend to look at salient targets. This is suboptimal, because educated guesses can be made about target presence at these locations without looking (Verghese, 2012). We ran an experiment and constructed Bayesian models to test the generality of this finding. Participants saw stimuli at two locations for 400 msec (i.e., allowing only 1 saccade), and then judged target presence at each location. Noise of low or high contrast was superimposed at the two locations. We observed individual differences in saccade strategies. One participant made no saccades, while achieving reasonable performance. Others applied a mixture of strategies, sometimes favoring salient targets, sometimes favoring uncertain locations. This work provides further insight into task and cognitive constraints that influence saccade strategy selection.",>Christian P.

We presented the children with stories ending with a ‘p but q’ sentence. They were instructed to indicate the ‘appropriate’ conclusion introduced by either ‘so’ or ‘nevertheless’. In addition, we measured children’s working memory (WM)-capacity in order to explore the possibility that making these inferences is effortful. Our results show that children do make the inferences to a certain extent but are sensitive to the content of the arguments. Whenever the p- or q-argument is an absurd argument (contrasted with a sensible argument), this argument almost always gets ignored in favor of the sensible argument, irrespective of the ‘appropriate’ conclusion ‘but’ directs the reader to.

In SpAM, multiple stimuli are freely arranged in two dimensions such that more similar stimuli are close together. We performed two SpAM experiments to investigate the process by which participants make multiple simultaneous similarity judgments using novel stimuli. The experiments differed across either two or three feature dimensions. Mouse and Eye-tracking measures, as well as the sequence of stimuli placed, provided a rich picture of participants’ decision processes as they made these judgments. Both experiments revealed strong effects of group context. Clustered presentation of stimuli by feature influenced both the order and the timing of placements, and despite equal metric spacing of stimuli along each dimension, participants typically warped placements along dimensions nonlinearly.

2013,How Do People Judge Conjunctive Probabilities from Experience? A Hierarchical Bayesian Model Comparison,"Judging whether multiple events will co-occur is an important aspect of everyday decision making; however, the underlying probabilities of occurrence are usually unknown and have to be inferred from experience. Using a rigorous, quantitative model comparison, we investigate how people judge the probabilities of multiple events to co-occur. In a computerized experiment, participants had to repeatedly choose between two pairs of conjunctive events (represented as two gambles). Participants had access to a small sample of information to estimate the probability that both events occur. A hierarchical Bayesian approach used for estimating the models’ parameters and for testing the models against each other showed that the plurality of participants were best described by the configural weighted average model. This model assumes that constituent probabilities are ranked by importance, weighted accordingly, and added up. The cognitive modeling approach provides an understanding of the cognitive processes underlying people's conjunctive probability judgments.",>Mirjam Annina Jenny>Jörg Rieskamp>Håkan Nilsson,">Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland >Uppsala University, Sweden",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0807/index.html
2013,Social institutions as tools in normative cognition,"Humans have the unique ability to have goals, cooperate according to plans and in respect of norms and rules (football is a good modern example). This ability is based on 1) collective intentionality among participants, 2) distributed cognition of the shared plan and 3) normative cognition in the ability to follow rules and 4) evaluate practice in relation to norms. In cooperative social interaction, social institutions function by uniting these 4 dimensions. Social institutions ‘make us smart’ collectively when constitutive rules and regulative rules on the socio-cultural level are internalized as constitutive and regulative representations on the cognitive level (knowing ’what counts as what’). Social institutions are cognitive tools with force because they ‘store’ and ‘radiate’ normative cognition and often ‘crystallize’ in rituals, e.g. weddings (fusing 1-4). The functions of normative cognition in social institutions should be an important subject in cognitive anthropology.",>Jeppe Sinding Jensen,">Aarhus University, MINDlab",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0808/index.html
2013,Modeling spatial language acquisition as a function of lexical verb development,"Learning to linguistically encode spatial relations is traditionally considered a problem of acquiring the meanings of prepositions (in, on, under). Based on production data from English speaking 4-year-olds, 6-year-olds and adults, we provide evidence for an alternative verb-based hypothesis: children and adults may essentially share spatial concepts and prepositional semantics, differing primarily in their use of lexical verbs (hang, stick, attach) to describe spatial relations. This hypothesis was formalized as a hierarchical generative model in which child and adult spatial descriptions are drawn from a common distribution, modulo a penalty on lexical verbs that is stronger for children. The model accounted for child production data significantly better than a model based on average adult performance, and the strengths of the estimated penalties were overall greater for 4-year-olds than for 6-year-olds, suggesting a developmental process in which lexical verbs gradually become integrated into the linguistic system for describing spatial relations.",>Kristen Johannes>Barbara Landau>Colin Wilson,">Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0809/index.html
2013,Eye movements “steal” response time effect during imagery scanning,"Several behavioral studies have reported functional similarities between visuospatial imagery and visuospatial perception. For instance, in the classic image-scanning paradigm (Finke & Pinker, 1982) participants first inspect a dot pattern, which later disappears and is replaced by an arrow on a blank screen. The task is to judge whether the arrow points towards one of the previous dots. Results commonly show that the response time (RT) increases linearly with the distance between the arrow and the previous dot and has been taken as evidence for a structural equivalence between perception and imagery. Typically eye movements are prevented in this paradigm. In the present study, eye movements were recorded for 23 participants in a free viewing version of the image-scanning paradigm. Results revealed that saccadic amplitudes increased linearly with the “imagined” scanning distance (p < .001). But contrary to previous studies there was no significant effect between RT and scanning distance.",>Roger Johansson>Jana Holsanova,">Cognitive Science Department, Lund University>Cognitive Science Department, Lund University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0810/index.html
2013,Early Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) sensitive to animacy expectations in sentence comprehension are not overridden by context,"Wh-words in auditory sentences like ""Who/What did Barbie push the ___ into?"" generate expectations for animacy at the blank (e.g., a filled potential Wh-gap). Specifically, the animacy is expected to be opposite of the Wh-word ( “who” and “what” predict inanimate and animate nouns, respectively). Fontenau and van der Lely (2008) found Early Left Anterior Negativities (ELANs) when animacy matched Wh- animacy in typically developing individuals but not individuals with ""Grammatical-Specific Language Impairment"". However, to focus attention on the task, they added final noun phrases to violation items (""Who did Barbie push the clown into THE WALL?"") but not to expected animacy items (""What did Barney push the clown into?""). We ask whether participants implicitly learn to predict sentence-final anomalies from animacy match. We tested this by presenting one group with the original contingency and another with the contingency reversed. Contra the learning hypothesis, we observed ELANs for both groups.",>Alexis R.

2013,Adult Category Learning Differences Predicted by a Dynamic Neural Field Theory Account of Information Sampled from the Fovea,"Here we explore the possibility that the speed of learning is affected by the precision of our sensory estimates for the learned category’s diagnostic feature dimensions. Colour information from a foveated stimulus, if represented as a sample on a metric colour dimension, should faithfully represent differences in the shapes and precision of the estimates as a consequence of the sample size. Differences in the sample variability are expected to have affect on exactly what gets associated during learning. We provide evidence that a manipulation in sub-fovea feature size, 0.18° vs 1.19° of visual angle, influences learning speed. In both conditions the simple colour features are easy to see and we do not detect any gaze differences as measured by total fixation durations and individual feature fixation durations.

This research has mostly relied on priming and interference procedures, or measuring brain activity. The present study manipulated the perceptual appearance of words, specifically font size, to be congruent or incongruent with an object’s actual size (e.g., elephant presented in a large or small font, respectively). Participants were presented with the words prior to a recognition memory test and property judgment task, in the same session and after a 2-week delay, to see if the perceptual font information would be incorporated into the representations of words to potentially alter participants' memory and judgments. Font size generally did not significantly affect how participants represented and processed the words. These results therefore present a challenge for embodied accounts of semantics, but some potential explanations and issues will be discussed.",>Natalie A. Kacinik>Rita W. El-Haddad>Kendall J.

2013,Navigating the Social Environment: An Ecological Rationality Perspective on Advice Taking Behavior,"Many decisions are made under the advice of another person. We investigated the environmental circumstances under which two prominent strategies—averaging and choosing—are effective and adaptive and explored how people employ them. We report two experiments, in which participants (N = 111 and N = 90, respectively) provided initial estimates for general knowledge questions that varied in perceived difficulty. In Experiment 2, they additionally received advice in the form of an estimate and confidence rating of another person before providing a revised estimate. We found that items of different perceived levels of difficulty exhibited distinctive statistical properties, thus constituting different social environments. Environmental structure affected the theoretical performance of strategies (such as averaging and choosing), and the ways, in which people integrate advice. We embed our analyses in the frameworks of ecological rationality and the probability, accuracy, redundancy (PAR) model of advice taking (Soll & Larrick’s, 2009; JEP:LMC, 35).",>Juliane Eva Kämmer>Hansjörg Neth>Pantelis Pipergias Analytis>Mehdi Moussaïd,">Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0814/index.html
2013,Be a better multitasker. How a pause in the primary task can turn a rational into an irrational multitasker.,"Threaded cognition theory predicts that switching is opportunistic and depends on availability of cognitive resources. Laboratory studies of multitasking suggest people are rational in their switch choices regarding multitasking, while observational studies suggest they are not. To establish whether effective multitasking can become ineffective we introduced delays in the primary task. The participants answered emails by looking up information (similar to customer-service employees) while being interrupted by chat messages. When participants were faced with a delay in the email task, they switched more often to the chat task on high-workload points. Choosing to switch to the secondary task instead of waiting made them slower. It also made them forget the information of the e-mail task half of the time, which slowed them down even more. We concluded that people’s rationality in multitasking behavior is only local, which agrees with the threaded cognition account of switching.",>Ioanna Katidioti>Niels Taatgen,">University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands>University of Groningen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0815/index.html

In the workshop, each child and caregiver arranged a room layout using a prepared set of furniture. We then interviewed them about the layout of the arranged room and their own room at their home. We categorized their arrangement of the furniture into ""center-arrangement"" and ""corner-arrangement"" using video-data.

2013,The Influence of Observing Versus Imitating Gestures in L2 Phoneme Instruction,"Previous research has shown that auditory training helps non-native speakers learn to perceive difficult phonemic contrasts in a second language (L2) (Hirata, 2004), but there is much room for improvement. Given that hand gestures influence many aspects of native language processing (Hostetter, 2011), we examined whether imitating versus observing gestures helps to improve native English speakers’ ability to perceive novel phoneme contrasts in Japanese as an L2. Participants were assigned to either a gesture observe or gesture imitate training condition. There was no overall training advantage of imitating gestures over simply observing them. However, in a preliminary analysis of a sub-group of participants with low scores on the auditory pretest, observing gestures was actually more beneficial than imitating them on an ERP post-test of auditory perception. The results suggest that producing gestures does not always help with learning, and for particularly challenging auditory perceptual tasks, may actually interfere with it.",>Spencer Kelly>Yukari Hirata>Carmen Lin>Zach Zhao,">Colgate University, Hamilton, NY, USA>Colgate University, Hamilton, NY, USA>Northwestern University,

2013,Tracking Scrambled Word Order While Reasoning with Diagrams,"Word order varies not only across languages but also within a specific language. Turkish, for example, has a non-rigid word order. Therefore, it is a good test-bed to understand the processing complexity driven by the order. One way to observe the complexity is to investigate it via diagrammatic reasoning. In this study, 18 sentences with scrambled word orders and the corresponding diagrammatic representations were analyzed by 20 Turkish native speakers. There were deliberate errors in the representations and the participants were asked to report them. The participants’ eye-movement data were also collected. Results indicate that scrambled word ordering also causes latencies in diagrammatic reasoning task. The eye-movement fixation orders showed that the participants favored VSO and VOS eye-fixation orders independent of sentential word orders. It is also concluded that finding the errors in verbal representations were more time consuming than finding the errors in object and subject representations.",>Özkan Kılıç,">Department of Cognitive Science, Graduate School of Informatics,

The placeholder structure consists of symbols whose meanings are initially learned in terms of each other. Later, the placeholder structure is infused with meanings via the so-called modelling processes. A modelling process can be analogical mapping, abduction, induction, etc. Susan Carey (2009) introduced Quinian bootstrapping in her explanation of the acquisition of numeral list representation and rational number as well as certain aspects of intuitive physics. Second, I apply this well-known learning mechanism to the acquisition of the meaning of mental terms. I distinguish between three stages in the learning of the semantics of mental words.

This study aimed at exploring the three postulated spaces, especially model space, by means of verbal protocols. Participants (n=32) were asked to think aloud while working with a computer based learning program. With this program they could learn about torques in physics using interactive graphics in which experiments could be conducted. Their knowledge about torques was tested before and after working with the program. Verbal protocols were analyzed with regard to the amount of search of the three spaces and regarding the quality of the participants’ models for torques. Our results add to the validity of model space, showing that the three postulated spaces could be reliably identified in the protocols and that the model quality score predicted final knowledge beyond prior knowledge.",>Saskia Kistner>Bruce D.

The memory system is an integration of three distributed memory systems associated with respective autonomous organic systems, including the perceptual system that takes care of sensory input from the environment, the conscious system that performs deliberate decision making, and the unconscious system that carries out action selections in the environment. This memory system architecture is consistent with the wide range of recent findings in the field of neurosciences. The memory system architecture works as a memory component in the comprehensive real brain model, MHP/RT, published in the Cognitive Science conferences, and the BICA conferences. MHP/RT is capable of simulating human daily behavior considering real time constraints that should define strong mutual dependencies among the three systems.

Prior to making their judgments, the participants in the lie condition were required to describe some behaviors exhibited by the target individual that indicated that he was lying. Similarly, prior to making their judgments, those in the truth condition were asked to describe some behaviors exhibited by the target individual that indicated that he was telling the truth. The participants in the control condition were asked only to make judgments. The participants in the lie condition detected lies more often than those in the other two conditions.

In this study, we examine the anisotropy of personal space in a virtual room constructed by three-dimensional computer graphics. In two experiments, a participant took the first-person point of view, and an unfamiliar avatar was placed in the virtual room. The stop-distance technique was used to measure the personal space between the participant and avatar. The participant was required to approach the avatar until he or she felt uncomfortable (approaching condition) or to retreat from it until he or she felt comfortable (retreating condition). We also controlled the room size and the unfamiliar avatar's direction. The results clearly showed that the personal space was larger under the approaching condition than under the retreating condition.

This involved pairwise communication in which the pairs engaged in a coordination task through an exchange of messages composed of a small set of geometric figures. We analyzed the transfer entropy—which is a measure of the information flow between two information sources or stochastic processes—between the figures used and the actions by individuals. Consequently, we confirmed that the transfer entropy reduced significantly across individuals, but not within each individual. Moreover, it correlated negatively with the performance of the task. From these results, we suggest that the transfer entropy appropriately shows the degree of formation of symbol communication systems. Then, we report the causal relationship between the uncertainty and the performances using a computational model based on reinforcement learning.",>Takeshi Konno>Junya Morita>Takashi Hashimoto,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0824/index.html
2013,Are forgetting processes crucial to category learning?,"In noisy domains where category distributions overlap, people categorise better at test after being trained on idealised category structures. This may happen, because under the assumption that humans selectively sample from memory when performing categorisation, idealised category learning leads to sampling of more appropriate items and better performance. Here we propose that idealisation of category distributions occurs naturally via a process of forgetting and re-estimation of category labels. We model a process in which items’ category membership is forgotten and then re-estimated from the remaining distributions. With time this leads to lowering the variance of category distributions, equivalent to idealising training data. We test this potential idealisation in a paradigm in which we train participants on overlapping category distributions and withdraw feedback for some trials in one group thus enforcing re-estimation of categories. The model predicts that the group with less feedback will perform better at test due to idealisation.",>Lukasz Kopec>Brad C.

2013,Words activate categorization even before the category forming task has been offered,"The effect of language on category learning is an ongoing debate among researchers. According to previous research words can facilitate category formation even if they aren’t used as feedback. However in most research investigating language influence on category learning, the varying of verbal labels often correlates with varying of perceptual features. Such confound doesn’t allow to clarify if the language is a means of perception augmentation (language-feedback hypothesis) or a social marker for generalization (word-meaning-as-intention hypothesis). In the present experiment we separated the process of category learning from the label receiving. Two groups of subjects performed visual search task either with or without labels. Right after that task subjects had to form a category on the basis of new perceptual information added to the old one. As a result subjects from label condition form a category but subjects from the no-label condition didn’t.

To characterize the neural correlates of the influence of ethnicity and engagement on emotion perception, German participants rated the valence of video-sequences while undergoing fMRI. In these video-sequences Asian-looking and European-looking virtual characters expressed a positive (happiness) and a negative (anger) emotion while either gazing directly at the participants or at another agent, thereby varying the perception of engagement. Results show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is involved when participants observe ethnic in-group members compared to ethnic out-group members express a positive emotion at them compared to at another person.

For example, both disciplines are principally engaged in describing and visualizing facts about basic categories of mind (space, objects, language, etc.). Along these lines, conceptual art can inform the cognitive science of abstract concepts. Cognitive scientists studying aesthetics can also learn from conceptual artists to push their research forward. While empirical investigations in aesthetics typically focus on perceptual preferences (i.e., “what is beauty?”), conceptual art often goes deeper ontologically (i.e., “what is art?”). This level of analysis can inform questions regarding the evolution of art and object processing. The present study examines the artwork of Mel Bochner who may have staged the first conceptual art exhibition (1966).

We investigated the possibility that the efficiency of feature detection of visual stimuli would be related to uncertainty in their proportion judgment. Concretely, our participants in the experiments performed proportion judgment task using two sets of visual stimuli pairs, ""red vs. green dots"" and ""right vs. left tilted lines"". In addition, we adopted different types of responses; in one condition, the participants were asked to response using numerals; in another condition, they were asked to response by adjusting the line bar which indicated the proportion.

In the experiments we demonstrate that, as a result of the specially organized preliminary experimental series, it is possible to receive the steady priming-effect for the unconscious stimulus which initially didn’t render any noticeable influence on the effectiveness of the tasks solutions. We can conclude, that at unconscious level cognitive system analyzes series of unconscious influences.

First, participants were instructed to learn a number of goal locations in a virtual model of the Tate Gallery London. Then, participants in the experimental condition were instructed to place five unique landmarks in order to re-find the goals in a third phase; participants in a control condition could not place landmarks.

We focus on a core issue: why do people struggle to solve problems that require a creative insight and what type of support can make success into the norm? Drawing on the idea of relational encoding (e.g., Gentner, Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003), we sought to improve creative problem solving by activating structured content (relations between objects) in the problem encoding. We developed an alternative to a comparison task: completing a set of sentence frames explaining how pairs of objects in the problem setting relate to one another. In two experiments, we found evidence that participants in the relational encoding group were significantly more likely to solve an insight problem than controls. An important caveat is that the advantage was only found for the easier problems tested - there were no differences for the more difficult problems.

A current conjecture in neuroscience is that a brain, organized in this way, can effectively and efficiently perform genuine Bayesian inferences. Given that many forms of cognition seem to be well characterized as Bayesian inferences, this conjecture has great import for cognitive science. It suggests that hierarchical predictive coding may provide a neurally plausible account of how forms of cognition that are modeled as Bayesian inference may be physically implemented in the brain. Yet, the jury is still out on whether or not the conjecture is really true. In this presentation, we demonstrate that each key sub-computation invoked in hierarchical predictive coding potentially hides a computationally intractable problem.

2013,What working memory subcomponents are needed in the acquisition of survey knowledge? Evidences from direction estimation and shortcut tasks,"Survey spatial representations are map-like mental representations in which directional relationships among landmarks are preserved. Survey representations allow people not only to re-trace routes already experienced, but also to find new routes and shortcuts (Golledge et al., 1999). This study investigated whether and to what extent verbal and spatial working memory (WM) are implicated in the construction of survey representations. We adopted a dual-task paradigm, asking participants to learn a new environment from navigation and, concurrently, to perform either a verbal or a spatial task, assumed to load verbal and spatial WM, respectively.

2013,Investigating Elementary and College Students’ Development of Numerosity Judgment Using Eye-Tracking Technology,"Numerosity judgment involves determining the number of items, which highly correlates with mathematical achievement. This study investigated age-related differences on numerosity judgment among middle-level elementary students and college students in terms of strategy use and problem-solving efficiency determined by participants’ eye movements. Stimuli were grids consisting of 7 x 7 units which were either “on” (yellow block) or “off” (blank). Participants were asked to determine the number of yellow blocks. Results showed that given energy- and time- consuming, third graders consistently adopted “addition strategy” on larger numerosity trials. For strategy adaptiveness, adults outperformed younger peers, most of whom starting using “subtraction strategy” on critical and larger trials (e.g., 25 and larger numerosities). Regarding efficiency, adults determined numerosities more efficiently than elementary students, because adults’ eye fixations were significantly fewer than those of younger groups, while only marginal difference on the number of fixations was observed for the two younger groups.",>Meng-Lung Lai>Meng-Jung Tsai>Liang-Chen Chien>Yi-Chen Chen,">National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan, Taiwan>National Taiwan University of Science and Technology>National Chiayi University>National Chiayi University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0837/index.html
2013,Motor Resonance Effects Modulated by Perspective: A Role of Linguistic Contrual on Social Action Perception,"We investigated motor resonance effect(MRE) during perceiving interactive social action scenes of two people. Perspectives of the social action scenes were manipulated by the voice (active vs. passive) of sentences describing the scenes. In Exp1, subjects' response time for stepping on a pedal was analyzed for investigating MRE during understanding of the scenes where a person is stepping on a foot of the other person. In Exp2, the response time by the lip action on a microphone were analyzed for exploring MRE during perceiving of the scenes where a person is biting an arm of the other person. In results, the MRE in both experiments was significant only when the scenes were described in the active voice. Our results indicate that the motor resonance effect can occur during perception of social events, but it can be modulated by the perspective of the mental construal of the event.",>Donghoon Lee>JaRang Kwak>YoungIn Lee,">Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea>Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea>Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0838/index.html
2013,Psych Predicates: Subjectivity and Evidentiality,"This work investigates why the psych sentence 'She is dizzy' with the third person subject in PRESENT fine, whereas its counterparts in Korean and Japanese are odd unlike the first person subject utterance na-nun ecirew-e (K) ‘I am dizzy.’ We have no way of knowing if others’ internal psych state is such at speech time. We argue that an evidence acquisition event (ee.a) such as I just heard from Mary/I just saw Mary precedes or is accommodated prior to speech time for the third person present psych sentence even in English. The PRESENT realization is a consequence of “double access” sequence of tense interpretation in English, i.e. Mary was dizzy and still is dizzy. A psych predicate requires the 1st person Experiencer’s direct perceptual experience of one’s own psych state or of individual object as in predicates of personal taste.

2013,Neural representations of language switching in early bilinguals: An fMRI study,"To investigate neural activity with respect to language switching, we measured brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while 5 early Korean-Chinese bilinguals performed a covert property generation task with language switching. Forty stimulus photographs of animals and tools were presented as stimuli, accompanied by captions written either in Korean or Chinese. When the stimuli were shown in Korean, participants were asked to do the covert association production task in Chinese (K>C), and vice versa (C>K). Results from the fixed effect analysis revealed that the K>C condition (Korean as orthographic stimuli and Chinese as semantic execution language) activated primarily left precentral gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus while the C>K condition activated primarily the region straddling right precuneus and right middle/posterior cingulum. These contrasting activation patterns might support the hypothesis that the neural representations in language switching tasks hinge on the linguistic typology and the cognitive motor control.",>Miaomei Lei>Hiroyuki Akama>Brian Murphy,">Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan>Tokyo Institite of Technology,Japan>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0840/index.html
2013,Thinking metaphorically in Alzheimer’s Disease: priming cognitive domains to understand inferential content of sentences,"This paper looks into the effects of visual/linguistic stimuli in the activation of cognitive domains (e.g. image schemas for primary metaphors) which are necessary for the understanding of sentences content by individuals affected by Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). AD studies point out to cognitive impairments at early stages of the disease which make comprehension tasks such as abstract inference, and metaphorical reasoning more costly to AD subjects in comparison to other groups of normal aging. We designed a 3x3 experiment in which subjects (AD and control group) were presented with primes of cognitive domains (words, pictures, and ideograms as control) followed by a choice task of metaphorical, literal, and abstract sentences in order to measure time spent to understand sentences in each condition, and frequency of each choice. Our hypothesis is that when the subject is primed with visual rather than linguistic input of a domain, s/he understands more readily and more accurately the metaphorical/inferential content of a linguistic expression, even though literal understanding frequency keeps higher.",>Jan Leite>Berla Moraes>Mabia Toscano>Danielly  Lima,>Universidade Federal da Paraiba>Universidade Federal da Paraiba>Universidade Federal da Paraiba>Universidade Federal de Campina Grande,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0841/index.html

Though the linkage between mirror system and intention understanding has been examined by many studies, the evidence of activities of mirror system during the formation of human symbolic communication system, in which no explicit demonstration of actions is involved, are still limited. We recorded the neural activities with electroencephalography during a coordination game with message passing, which involves formation of symbolic communication system. In this experiment, two subjects were separated into two rooms, thus they could not see any movement of communication partners or hear any sound from the partners’ actions. Significant mu rhythm suppression is found over sensorimotor cortex both when the subjects send and receive messages.

2013,"A crosslinguistic look at how metaphor, manner, and aspect propel polititians through campaign races","Before an election, voters are inundated with messages about candidates running for office. Our work examines the influence of metaphor in messages about political races. Of special interest is the role of manner of motion (e.g., slow, fast) and aspect (e.g., perfective, imperfective) in messages that include motion metaphors (e.g., “Candidate A raced/was racing ahead of Candidate B” and “Candidate A inched/was inching ahead of Candidate B”). We discuss results from our experiments with English and Russian speakers. In line with our predictions, manner of motion and aspect were found to interact in interesting ways, and to systematically influence opinions about who is likely to win an election. These novel results have valuable theoretical and practical implications for political communication and how people conceptualize political elections, and expand prior work on framing effects in political talk, especially motion metaphors and grammatical aspect (Fausey & Matlock, 2010; Matlock, 2012).",>Patricia Lichtenstein>Marcus Perlman>Teenie Matlock,">University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, US>University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, United States>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0843/index.html

In study 1, priming by reading a biological or a religious story about death had no effect on skeptics' afterlife beliefs. In study 2, participants indicated whether they would partake in a (bogus) scientific study that involved visiting a fortune teller and whether they would prefer a fortune teller who predicts positive and negative events or one who predicts only positive events. Believers chose the positive fortune teller more often than skeptics did. Study 3 investigated whether participants' views about the afterlife, other paranormal phenomena, and ontological confusions differ in speeded and non-speeded response conditions. The results were moderated by thinking style: ontological confusions increased in speeded conditions for intuitive skeptics but not for reflective skeptics. The results indicate that skeptics don't hold implicit supernatural beliefs but intuitively thinking skeptics hold ontological confusions predisposing to supernatural beliefs.",>Marjaana Lindeman>Annika Svedholm,">University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland>University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0845/index.html
2013,Modeling the ecological rationality of decision strategies based on internet statistics,"Memory processes play a major role in many models of decision making. Several fast-and-frugal heuristics assume a sequential search of information in memory (e.g. the take-the-best heuristic). Fast-and-frugal heuristics exploit regularities in the structure of the environment and basic cognitive capacities, such as memory. However, until now only few attempts have been made to relate models of memory and decision making to the structure of information in the environment. The ACT-R architecture provides a quantitative theory about the interplay between the information structure in the environment and the memory system. Based on internet statistics, we use ACT-R to predict people´s recognition and knowledge about objects in the world, as well as the associated retrieval time distributions of respective memories. We show how a corresponding model integrating memory and decision processes within ACT-R allows predictions about the ecological rationality of decision strategies that operate on the accessibility of information in memory.",>Daniela Link>Julian Marewski,>Université de Lausanne>Université de Lausanne,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0846/index.html
2013,The Roles of the Goal and Internal Models in Motor Representation: A Pragmatic Explanation,"Motor representation is understood by Grush (2004) and Pezzulo (2008, 2011) in terms of simulation/emulation: internal models simulate motor effectors and environmental conditions. Motor intentionality, thus, is regarded as based on the standing-for relation. In their thesis of motor representation, knowing in preparation of motor actions is highlighted but the system’s doing when manipulating on-going motor activities is overlooked. That ‘system’s doing’, however, retains an essential role in motor intentionality, a role which accounts for complexities of real environment, animate apparatus to be represented, and goal-oriented nature of motor movements. Contrasted to Grush and Pezzulo’s thesis, my research highlights a pragmatic role of motor representation, pragmatic in sense of explaining how a motor agent can successfully achieve a goal by maintaining motor movements. Internal models, in my account, not only supply emulation but serve to assist the motor system in its goal-achieving activities, resulting in efficient control and flexible movements.",>Daniel Hsi-wen Liu,>Providence University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0847/index.html

In Experiment 1, three positions at the beginning of clauses were established and results suggest that Ss are better prepared the deeper into a sentence the click is. Experiment 2 ran an ERP experiment to determine whether these RTs were the result of the “uncertainty” Ss may have felt regarding the click position, the idea being that the amplitude of the P300 would correlate with the click positions. In Experiment 3, click positions were moved to the end of clauses to establish if the end of a sentence results in a specific strain on working memory. RTs show that Ss are slower in the first position but the measures even out after that, with the possibility that Ss may have attempted to “wrap it up” in both the second and the third positions.",>David J.

A lexical decision task to target verbs and nouns preceded by morphologically related primes of the same grammatical class was used to examine inflectional morphology, whereas the same target words preceded by primes of the other grammatical class were used to examine derivational morphology. Greek, a highly inflected language, allows use of words consisting of a stable stem and verb or noun inflectional suffixes, keeping the orthographic and phonological overlap constant across conditions. Both noun and verb targets were significantly primed by the same grammatical class, consistent with inflectional processing. When preceded by primes of different grammatical class, verb but not noun targets showed priming, precluding firm conclusions about derivational morphological processing.",>Sofia Loui>Athanassios Protopapas>Eleni Orfanidou,">University of Athens, Athens, Athens, Greece>University of Athens>University of Crete",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0849/index.html

Here we investigate the role of the meaningfulness of linguistic categories in categorical perception. To disentangle the effects of labels and semantic contents of verbal categories we employed a learning paradigm in which participants acquired information about initially unfamiliar objects. Linguistic knowledge was manipulated by labeling object pairs either with the same or different names. Furthermore, the labels could be associated with in-depth knowledge or learned in isolation. Two days after learning, the EEG was recorded while participants performed a lateralized object discrimination task. Verbal labels affected object processing already at about 120 ms, unaffected by semantics, while separate semantic effects were found at about 200 ms, suggesting that the influence of verbal categories on perception may not be modulated by semantic information associated with the categories.",>Martin Maier>Philipp Glage>Annette Hohlfeld>Rasha Abdel Rahman,>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin>Universität Potsdam>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0853/index.html

Twenty-two French dyslexic children were compared to 44 chronological age-matched and reading-level-matched controls. A syllable compatibility procedure was combined with a visual syllable detection task (Exp. 1) and a visual masked priming paradigm in a lexical decision task (Exp. 2). Dyslexic children exhibited robust frequency-modulated prelexical syllable effects; high-frequency syllables elicited a syllable compatibility effect in both experiments, while low-frequency syllables favored either a CV target length or a CVC prime length effect. The frequency-modulated syllable effects were constant across both experiments following an expected developmental course, especially in a highly feasible task (Exp. 1). However, performance was drastically low in a highly demanding task (Exp. 2), suggesting impaired phonological procedures.

2013,Disentangling the cognitive processes underlying the testing effect,"Tests modify memory and can improve memory performance: Practice tests outperform additional study trials as a learning technique when the final memory test is difficult (e.g., delayed in time). This is referred to as the testing effect. Although existing theories propose single mechanisms to underlie this effect, the contributions of different cognitive processes are yet to be dissociated. Because most testing-effect accounts attribute the testing advantage to either encoding, maintenance, or retrieval processes, we propose a multinomial processing-tree model that disentangles the contributions of all three memory processes. By applying this model to testing-effect data, we show that (a) testing memory primarily creates maintenance benefits (i.e., resistance against forgetting) and that (b) the critical interaction of testing vs. study benefits with final-test delay is not driven by different retrieval strengths. Our results thus support maintenance accounts of the testing effect and are difficult to reconcile with retrieval-based explanations.",>Simone Malejka>Edgar Erdfelder,>University of Mannheim>University of Mannheim,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0855/index.html

One hundred subjects evaluated 300 IAPS pictures according to their valence, arousal and dominance. Affective space determined by valence and arousal dimensions had a similar distribution to the American sample. There were significantly high correlations between North American and Russian ratings of valence, arousal and dominance. Nevertheless comparison of these ratings showed that there are significant differences between North American and Russian valence, arousal and dominance scores. Such differences suggest cultural specificity оf situations which induce emotion and provide evidence of cultural factors effect on the affective experience. Lastly, it shows the importance of using local cultural norms for internationally available stimuli in addition to the original stimuli, even in the study of such universal processes as an emotion.

2013,Changes in information search strategy under “dense” hypothesis spaces,"Research on information search has found widespread evidence of a “positive test strategy” (PTS), where people search for predicted outcomes of a focal hypothesis. A recent analysis by Navarro and Perfors (2011) showed that the PTS is consistent with normative models of search under “sparse” hypothesis spaces, where each possible outcome is predicted by a minority of hypotheses (a property shared by common kinds of categories). Despite this justification, learning often involves a transition to a “dense” hypothesis space as information is accumulated, at which point the PTS becomes markedly worse than a strategy of searching for diagnostic information about multiple hypotheses. Using a perceptual search task, our experiment tested whether people independently switch between these strategies based solely on changes in sparsity. The results show that, in general, people continue to make errors consistent with the PTS even when faced with “dense” hypothesis spaces where that strategy is ineffective.",>Doug Markant>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0857/index.html

To verify this new categorization, an experiment was conducted with 84 participants in regard to the presence/absence of goals in naturally observed infant interactions form a Western and a non-industrial community. Results demonstrate that the extended categorization of engagement levels via interaction components and processes is sound because there are no significant differences between sites, and no significant differences between participants and trained coders.

How does the mere presence of a friend alter spatial reasoning? Here, participants imagined working for an outdoor magazine. They viewed photos of bridges one might encounter while hiking. Some participants were told they preferred crossing bridges last (in a group), while others were told they preferred crossing them first. All participants estimated bridge length. Those who crossed last, and imagined their friends on the other side of the bridge, provided reliably shorter length estimates than those who crossed first and imagined their friends standing immediately behind them.

2013,Causal Dispositions and Transitivity in Causal Chains,"A number of popular philosophical and psychological theories that model causality in terms of causal dependency assume that causal relations in chains are transitive. When A causes B, and B causes C it typically follows that A also causes C. In contrast, dispositional theories focus on intrinsic causal properties (i.e., causal dispositions) of the involved participants of causal relations. According to this account, a causal chain is transitive only when A originally has a disposition towards C. We present an experiment that contrasts scenarios with transitive chains (A disposes towards C) and scenarios with intransitive chains (A does not dispose towards C), according to the dispositional account. In line with dispositional theories of causation, we found a strong dissociation between cause-effect judgments (A causes C) and probability judgments, P(C|A), in intransitive scenarios but not in transitive scenarios. Across both types of scenarios judgments for single relations did not differ.",>Ralf Mayrhofer>Inesa Hildenbrand>Michael Waldmann,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0860/index.html

In the present study we investigate whether sound is used systematically in spatial relational terms in 17 languages, and whether native English-speaking individuals can determine the meanings of these terms. In a forced-choice task, participants were asked to choose the correct English translation for each unfamiliar foreign word. All items were spatial terms with either proximal or distal meanings (translations of English 'here', 'there', 'near', 'far', 'this', 'that'). Participants nominated the correct meanings of the words significantly above chance, suggesting that they used sound structure to infer meaning. Acoustic analyses were conducted to examine the relation of acoustic properties to word meaning, as well as to listeners’ judgments. The findings suggest that the sound structure of language can be systematically used to mark relational meanings related to space.",>Kelly McCormick>Lynne Nygaard,>Emory University>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0861/index.html
2013,"From symbols to analog magnitudes: A process model of fraction comparison, with fits to experimental data","Recent evidence suggests that fractions are represented as visuo-spatial analog magnitudes on a “mental number line” (Schneider and Siegler, 2010). In order to test this theory, we evaluated subjects in two tasks: fraction comparison and number-line marking. Both magnitude difference and response time to mark a fraction on the number line predicted response time to compare the fraction’s magnitude to a standard held in memory. This supports the notion that even symbolic numerical cognition is grounded in visuo-spatial processing. We also found a symbolic cost to processing: fractions with more digits were processed more slowly. We propose a model of fraction comparison wherein fractions are processed from symbols into analog magnitudes, then compared to a standard by sequential sampling decision-making. This model provides a superior fit when compared to the log distance model, despite having fewer parameters. Furthermore, it has a direct interpretation in terms of psychological processes.",>Cameron Ross Lloyd McKenzie>James McClelland,">Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0862/index.html

The question was to what extent would these two cues compete for control of behavior? We assessed this by comparing the dual cue group to a color only control and a sequence only control. Our results showed that the dual group learned about both cues to about the same extent as the individual controls, but that when switched to a test phase where each cue could be assessed independently, the dual group showed a marked decline in performance relative to the controls. We interpret this as evidence for overshadowing occurring between the two predictive cues in the dual group.",>Rossy McLaren>Fergal Jones>Fayme Yeates>Ian P. L.

However, research has shown that children tend to produce too little information (under-description) and adults tend to provide too much information (over-description). In this study, we examined the production of referring expressions across the course of development (i.e. 7–18 years). Participants were required to generate a referring expression, and we manipulated the presence or absence of a contrasting object and display complexity. Results showed an age effect on the production of under-descriptions: Young children produced significantly more under-descriptions in more complex arrays compared to older children. In addition, an analysis of voice onset times and eye movements investigated whether there are speed-accuracy tradeoffs associated with visual search and the tendency to include extra information.

2013,The role of action prediction and control in young children’s joint action coordination,"Coordinating actions with another person can be a challenging endeavor for young children. For smooth coordination of actions with another person two skills are hypothesized to be crucial: action prediction and inhibitory control. In this study, we investigated how developing abilities of action prediction and inhibitory control are related to young children’s joint action coordination. Using a simple turn-taking game, 2½-year-olds’ joint action coordination performance (timing variability and accuracy) was assessed. Additionally, children’s action prediction skills were measured by anticipatory looks using eye-tracking. Inhibitory control was tested in an age-appropriate gift delay task. Results show that timing stability during the joint coordination was positively correlated to measures of action prediction. In turn, accuracy in the joint coordination was positively correlated with measures of inhibitory control. These findings indicate a distinctive role of action prediction and inhibitory action control for different coordination qualities (timing variability and accuracy) in young children.",>Marlene Meyer>Harold Bekkering>Rianne Haartsen>Janny C.

All participants received offline cTBS to the hand area of vPMC in one session and to the lip area in a separate session, and after each session performed an action-interpretation task in which half of the trials were pantomimed hand actions and half were pantomimed mouth actions. The results show that participants were less accurate in interpreting hand actions after receiving cTBS over the hand area than after receiving stimulation over the lip area, and less accurate at interpreting lip actions after receiving cTBS over the lip area than after receiving stimulation over the hand area. This double dissociation provides evidence in support of the claim that somatotopically organized regions of vPMC contribute causally to action interpretation, and the claim that action production and action interpretation rely on overlapping mechanisms. In more general terms, they reveal an involvement of the motor system in more sophisticated cognitive processes than has hitherto been demonstrated.",>John Michael,">Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0866/index.html
2013,Running circles around symbol manipulation in trigonometry,"Recent evidence suggests that we have an intuitive number sense and that visuospatial processes may ground simple mathematical reasoning, but higher level mathematical cognition is often assumed to depend only on the manipulation of symbolic expressions, governed by a set of rules and logical axioms. To assess rule vs. visuospatial thinking in a higher level mathematical domain, we asked undergraduates to solve trigonometry problems and to report their use of rules, mnemonics, and visuospatial representations including the unit circle, right triangle, and sine and cosine waves. Use of the unit circle was reported most commonly, and was associated with better performance, even after controlling for the extent and recency of trigonometry experience. While unit circle users took more time, their performance was robust to problems that rule users tended to fail. Our findings suggest that even higher level mathematical cognition is more than just the manipulation of symbolic expressions.",>Kevin W. Mickey>James L.

2013,The Glamorgan Problem Solver (GLAM-PS): A Distributed and Embodied Production System Architecture for Cognition,"The Glamorgan Problem Solver (GLAM-PS), an example of a computationally implemented theory of embodied cognition, is a novel cognitive architecture that has been applied to algebra problem solving, Tower of London problem solving and Stroop Tasks. GLAM-PS is a distributed production system architecture, with all modules playing a role either in perception or action. Each module has its own working memory, production memory and production matching bottleneck. Inter-module communication allows each module to see the working memory of other modules and to coordinate action with activity in other modules. Despite the lack of explicit goal representation the architecture is able to model offline multi-step problem solving in algebra. Action representations are used to hierarchically structure action in Tower of London problem solving, allowing ‘subgoaling’ of particular disks. Performance on Stroop Tasks highlights the architecture’s ability to model controlled behaviour. These domains demonstrate GLAM-PS potential for providing insights into human behaviour.",>Gareth Miles,>University of South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0868/index.html
2013,The Influence of Selective Attention during Memory Retrieval on Subsequent Memory Performance in Young and Older Adults,"Much effort has been devoted to exploring the ways in which manipulating attention during encoding influences performance on memory tasks (Craik et al., 1996). However, fewer studies have examined the effects of manipulating attention during memory retrieval. The purpose of this study was to further examine selective attention at retrieval in the young and elderly. Younger and older adult participants were exposed to a study list followed by a recognition test. Participants made memory decisions under selective attention or full attention conditions (Dudukovic et al., 2009). Participants then completed a memory test consisting of items that had been previously tested under full attention, selective attention, and selectively ignored conditions as well as previously untested items. The results suggest that selective attention during retrieval does not result in significant costs for memory decisions regardless of age group. The results are discussed with reference to current theories of aging, attention, and memory.",>Jeremy K. Miller>Kyle L.

Here we test the hypothesis that greater levels of arbitrariness in the material to be learned are associated with an increased involvement of sleep (Eichenbaum et al., 1999). Two participant groups were trained to equivalent levels on novel words incorporating regularities mirroring a grammatical gender system. After training, participants had a 90-min break filled with either a polysomnographically recorded nap or an awake control task. Subsequently, the nap group outperformed the wake group in recognition and recall of the trained vocabulary items. Both groups showed evidence of generalization of the systematic aspects of the grammar to untrained items, but the nap group outperformed the awake on the grammar test on the trained items. The findings are discussed in the context of the Complementary Learning Systems approach (Kumaran & McClelland, 2012; McClelland etal. 1995).",>Jelena Mirkovic>Gareth Gaskell,>University of York>University of York,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0870/index.html
2013,How Teacher Support Children’s Empathic Understandings toward Characters? -Focusing on the presentations of similar situations-,"The present study examined how the presentation of similar situation to character’s situation would support children’s empathic understandings toward character. According to Barnes & Thagard(1997), people find similar situation of which the target is in, and transfer the emerging emotional state to target to understand his feelings empathically. Therefore, it was expected that teacher’s presentation of similar situation to character’s situation would scaffold children’s understandings toward character’s feelings. Sixth graders’ 6 moral education lessons were observed and speeches were recorded. The scenes, where similar situations to character’s situations were provided by teacher and used by children, were analyzed. As a result of qualitative analysis, the followings were found: 1) Children who had difficulties in understanding characters’ feelings were able to imagine it by using presented similar situations. 2) Teacher presented similar situations to emphasize not only “similarity”, but “differences” between situations to prompt children’s understandings toward characters.",>Satoko Miwa,">The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0871/index.html
2013,The effects of the harmonization between a word’s meaning and its expression style on implicit memory: Differences between typography in vision and prosody in sounds,"An expression style refers the graphical or phonological style of language. (i.e., letters or phonemes in words). In daily life, typographies or prosodies are often made to harmonize its connotative meanings with words’ meanings they convey. To investigate the role of these harmonization, we demonstrated previously that the harmonization between words’ meaning and the typography at encoding had effects on implicit memory in the visual word-fragment completion task (WFC), which implied that harmonization facilitated visual processing of presented words. Expecting that harmonization in sound and word’s meaning has same effects, we conducted another experiment, which manipulating the harmonization between words’ meaning and their prosody in utterance, using an auditory and visual (classical) WFC. The results showed no effects of harmonization. These results suggest that typography in visual processing and prosody in auditory processing had different function in their connotative meanings.",>Kozue Miyashiro>Etsuko T.

2013,Investigating phonological false memory effects of prior recall and recognition using the Remember-Know paradigm,"In this study, the relationship between prior recall and recognition and its effects on false memory was investigated using low and high confusable phonological associates. Participants who had falsely recalled critical words in an earlier phase were less likely to falsely recognize them later. This pattern of results is in contrast with veridical memory, where participants were more likely to recognize a word after correctly recalling it earlier. We further investigated this phenomenon with the remember-know paradigm, and found that recognition of prior recalled words was associated with more remember responses while recognition of falsely recalled critical words was associated with more know responses. These findings suggest that the underlying processes for veridical and false recognition may each involve different aspects of recollection and familiarity for phonological associates.",>Mohamed Shan-Rievan Mohamed Salleh>Winston Goh,">National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore>National University of Singapore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0873/index.html
2013,Learning and task-dependent factors affect production choices,"Production choices are driven by many factors: experience with language statistics, task-or message-specific factors and constraints on human cognition. Understanding how these constraints operate together is crucial for understanding sentence production. Speakers described human and inanimate targets (baby/vase) in scenes showing human agents acting on these targets. The task elicited relative clauses to contrast targets from competitors (“The baby/vase that the woman is carrying/that is being carried by the woman”). Participant utterances were affected by target noun animacy, and this effect persists across languages. This suggests a role for learning; a speaker’s lifetime of experience with their language, including structure alternatives afforded by each language, affects production choices. In addition to long-term learning, immediate demands affect production choices. Targets varied in visual salience, which affected structure choices. Effects are consistent with a task-dependent account of visual salience. Immediate and long-term learning motivations for these effects will be discussed.",>Jessica Montag>Maryellen MacDonald,>University of Wisconsin Madison>University of Wisconsin-Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0874/index.html
2013,Worry effects on visuospatial and verbal working memory,"Worry consists of intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts, usually in verbal form, about a future event of uncertain outcome. Excessive occupation of working memory (WM) subsystems by worry-related representations might cause deficits in WM performance and efficiency. Attentional Control Theory (ACT) predicts that worry occupies the central executive, but not the storage components of WM (phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad). We tested worry effects on visuospatial and verbal WM memory tasks, with and without binding, in 46 Brazilian undergradutes divided into a low-worry (LW, n=21, 11 female) and a high-worry (HW, n=25, 23 female) group. The HW group showed significantly lower accuracy in the verbal tasks and higher reaction times in the visuospatial tasks. Within the HW group, binding caused lower accuracy in the visual task and lower RTs in the verbal task. Results are discussed according to ACT, which predicts differential effects of worry on performance and efficiency accross WM modalities.",>Andre Luiz Moreno>Juliana Avila deSouza>Gustavo Gauer,>Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul>Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul>Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0875/index.html

People punish uncooperative individuals at a cost to themselves, inducing adherence to social norms. Little is known about altruistic punishment comparing ingroup and outgroup context. Using fMRI, we studied the behavior of altruistic punishment during the Third Party Punishment game. This game shows the behavior spending one’s own money, without any personal benefit, to punish unfair behavior of Player A who violate cooperation norms to Player B.This behavior may be differently displayed depending on the in-group (Player C and B same nationality) versus out-group (Player C and B different nationality) setting, in favor to one’s own group. This attitude is called parochial altruism.

After training, during an fMRI session, participants performed both the original task and a version of the task in which the function of a key part of the interface was modified. Analysis focused on the cognitive control network, a set of regions that decrease in activity with increasing levels of task experience. The functional connectivity of the anterior insula with the other regions of the control net work predicted the degree to which participants successfully adapted to this modified task better than other individual difference variables collected. The anterior insula is thought to be part of a salience network, and this salience network may help to inhibit old rules of the task set that must be replaced by new rules.",>Jarrod Moss>Winston Jones>Hao Bai>Stephanie Doane,>Mississippi State University>Mississippi State University>Mississippi State University>Mississippi State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0877/index.html
2013,Does the anticipation of a partner's reaction affect action planning? Spatial action-effect compatibility in a joint task,"Actions in joint tasks are affected by the way the partner is acting. As action planning is mediated by an anticipation of their sensory consequences, this influence is likely to encompass the expected reactions of others to one's own actions. If so, it should be easier to perform actions that trigger compatible partner reactions instead of incompatible ones. To test this, we used a spatial action-effect compatibility paradigm in a joint task. Subjects moved virtual objects to different locations on a multi-touch table, followed by either a partner's manual reactions on the same or another object, or by automatic visual effects. There was a tendency for faster performance of actions with compatible effects, and no interaction with effect type. However, for the joint condition alone, no reliable compatibility benefit was found. The results highlight several difficulties in applying the basic research on ideomotor action control to more naturalistic, joint tasks.",>Romy Müller>Dietrich Kammer,>Technische Universität Dresden>Technische Universität Dresden,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0878/index.html

In the present study, participants who estimated fatality statistics and listed possible causes before learning true statistics (Foresight) were more surprised than those who listed possible causes only after learning true statistics (Hindsight). Pezzo (2003) linked hindsight bias to causal explanations that minimize initial surprise after an outcome—but to what extent can people build an expectation for alternative causation before learning the true outcome? Before seeing true statistics, a subset of our Foresight participants listed causes for changes in the opposite of their expected direction. This did not reduce surprise for those who learned that statistics had moved in the opposite of expected direction, but the number of opposite causes they provided reliably predicted their second set of estimates. Moreover, participants frequently explained surprising statistics using their earlier alternative causes.",>Edward Munnich>Jennifer Milazzo>Jade Stannard>Katherine Rainford,>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0879/index.html
2013,Reciprocal Ascription of Intentions Realized in Robot-human Interaction,"Abstract: One of the promising strains of humanoid robotics is that which focuses on explicating and reproducing “inner” cognitive functions of humans. This approach is motivated by an ambitious aim of realizing a human-like mind in a robot. In this general context, we have been working on the mechanism of joint attention, the ability of which infants acquire during the earlier stage of development. We already succeeded in constructing a robot which can engage in joint attention activity of an elementary level. In a more matured stage, however, humans ascribe intentions to each other in joint attention. In order to realize this process in a robot, it is not sufficient for them merely to acquire the ability to follow others’ eye direction. Our point is that it is necessary to implement in a robot the relevant inferential mechanism which involves an apparatus for emotion-detection and object-categorization. In our presentation, we will show how this mechanism can work well in our infant-robot.",>Shoji Nagataki>Masayoshi Shibata>Takeshi Konno>Takashi Hashimoto>Hideki Ohira,>Chukyo University>Kanazawa University>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0880/index.html
2013,When irrelevance matters! Effects of distractor-response binding in binary choices under uncertainty,"The distractor-response binding effect states (Frings, Rothermund, & Wentura, 2007) that distractors appearing on a prime display create an association with the response given. This association is retrieved when, in the probe, the distractor is repeated; the retrieved response can be compatible or incompatible to the currently demanded probe response thereby influencing behavior. We tested if the distractor-response binding effect also occurs in decision making processes under uncertainty (N = 31). Participants had to decide whether two consecutive, imagined patients suffered from either of two diseases. Each decision was based on two cues; one did not discriminate between the two diseases and the other was either strongly or mildly associated with one of the two diseases. The repeating of the irrelevant cue influences decision significantly. Furthermore, we replicated these findings when we varied the strength of the discriminating cue as between-subject factor.",>Nadine Nett>Christian Frings,>Universität Trier>Universität Trier,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0881/index.html
2013,Multitasking Performance: Bound By Task Interference?,"When engaging in concurrent multitasking, it quickly becomes clear that some activities combine well, while others do not. But which factors determine the compatibility of different tasks? We propose that the overlap in cognitive resources causes interference between tasks that limit performance, and that this performance can be predicted using a cognitive model. To test this, we built a model of three tasks, each using a well-defined set of cognitive resources. These tasks were executed separately as well as concurrently and the performance of the model was recorded. Afterwards, we ran an experiment where participants had to perform the same paradigm. Our results show that the model prediction has a good qualitative fit to the participant data: task combinations with more resource overlap had lower performance when performed concurrently, compared to combinations with little or no overlap.",>Menno Nijboer>Niels Taatgen>Hedderik Van Rijn,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0882/index.html

The target appeared at left or right. One participant pressed a left or right button according to the color of the target when it was green or red. The other participant pressed a left or right button of another response set according to the location of the target when it was white.

A professional rakugo story-teller performed live in front of 20 audience members aged 16 to 67 (M = 40.6, SD = 16.4) in a laboratory. Videotaped performances were categorized by a computer-aided coding system, and the audience’s reactions were quantified using the face-tracking and background subtraction computer program. Results demonstrated performer-audience correlations only in a particular frequency band. While the audience often smiled in response to incongruent lines and interpreted gestures, the performer sometimes delivered the points only after audience-initiated smiles and movements.

2013,Strategy flexibility in algebraic problem solving: The influence of feedback and learners’ characteristics,"The ability to choose problem solving strategies flexibly and adaptively is an important part of expertise. However, it is unclear how simple forms of problem solving practice affect flexibility. We investigate to what extent flexibility in strategy use is dependent on learners’ characteristics as intelligence, working memory and prior knowledge and to what extent these individual differences influence how a student can exploit a learning situation. In a microgenetic design with 24 trials of a mathematical problem solving task, we found that ninth-graders adaptivity of strategy choices increased linearly during practice without feedback and that feedback on strategy adaptivity facilitated the process. Adapting strategy choices to problem types led to shorter solution paths, higher solution rates, and higher speed. This is true independently of students’ intelligence or working memory capacity. However, prior knowledge was a predictor of adaptivity, thus leading to a faster development of adaptivity.",>Daniela Nussbaumer>Michael Schneider>Elsbeth Stern,>ETH Zurich>University of Trier>ETH Zurich,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0885/index.html

The difference is caused by confidence in their opinions and their commitment to the decision making. We also proposed two extended methods corresponding to the different interaction processes. We then conducted an experiment to evaluate the methods using Embodied Conversational Agents.

In the experiment, participants explored a virtual circular room under the one of two conditions. The objects were arranged like spots on dice. In the Square Array, 4 objects were set in a square shape, while in the Node Array, one more object was added at the center.

In each task, students made an argument and persuaded different audiences (transfer student and old friend) at random. The contents of written arguments were categorized into ""claims"", ""evidence"", and ""reasoning"". Moreover, difficulty of each audience's persuasion and its reasons were asked in questionnaire. The analysis suggested followings. (1) Students generated more ""reasoning"" in transfer student condition than old friend.

2013,Cognitive Residues of Similarity: After-Effects of Similarity Computations in Visual Search,"What are the “cognitive after-effects” of making a similarity judgement? What, cognitively, is left behind and what effect might these residues have on subsequent processing? In this paper, we probe for such after-effects using a visual search task, performed after a task in which pictures of real-world objects were compared. So, target objects were first presented in a comparison task (e.g., rate the similarity of this object to another) thus, presumably, modifying some of their features before asking people to visually search for the same object in complex scenes (with distractors and camouflaged backgrounds). As visual search is known to be influenced by the features of target objects, then any after-effects of the comparison task should be revealed in subsequent visual searches. Results showed that when people previously rated an object as being high on a scale (e.g., colour similarity or general similarity) then visual search is inhibited (slower RTs and more saccades in eye-tracking) relative to an object being rated as low in the same scale. There was also some evidence that different comparison tasks (e.g., compare on colour or compare on general similarity) have differential effects on visual search.",>Stephanie O'Toole>Mark T Keane,>DCU>UCD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0889/index.html
2013,When is it rational to rely on heuristics?,"There have been two distinct notions of heuristics, i.e., Kahneman and Tversky’s (1974) heuristics as biased approximations to rational inference, and Gigerenzer et al.’s (1999) idea of smart and adaptive heuristics. Despite the conceptual differences, we provide evidence that heuristics can be seen as approximations to a rational account which is at its core adaptive. In a large cross-validation, we demonstrate that a regularized regression model (from machine learning) with a penalty noise parameter could outperform both heuristics and simple linear regression. Importantly, the penalized regression with an L2-norm could be approximated by tallying, whereas the L1-norm was approximated by take-the-best. Results indicate that the penalized regression treats both heuristics and linear regression as extreme cases of the model. The research implies a common rational basis for heuristics and integrative strategies, suggesting that the relation need not be adversarial. Implications for reconciling adaptive and irrational views of heuristics are discussed.",>Paula Parpart>Matt Jones>Bradley Love,>University College London>University of Colorado Boulder>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0890/index.html

In these cases, further usage of such information should be influenced by its presentation. With N = 157 students, we examined how referring to the tentativeness of health information by using hedges and pointing to the origin of scientific knowledge in science-related texts impacts processes of decision-making. We found that decisions were easier to make when there was no indication given. Furthermore, participants’ further use of text-related information was more likely when hedges were used. In contrast, individuals rather relied on their own knowledge when there were no linguistic markers of tentativeness. Additionally, participants’ decisions were more in favor of the direction implied in the texts when no indication of the sources of the science-related information was given. However, no effect of experimental manipulation on the confidence of the decisions exists. Finally, we discuss how the presentation of information may contribute to engaging in critical and elaborated processing of scientific information.",>Elisabeth Paus>Regina Jucks,">University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany>University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0891/index.html

In one of the most detailed of these theories, Brown and Levinson's, speakers pursue a single goal (e.g. getting the hearer to stop doing something) by using a mental model of the hearer to select a position on a one-dimensional spectrum of strategies that identifies the best balance between achieving the speaker's practical goal while avoiding offense to the hearer (as might occur from a purely brusque request). But are speakers actually limited to this one-dimensional spectrum of strategies? And given that people often pursue more than one goal at once, how might they do so in such a simplistic model of polite communication?

Using a picture book task we tested 24-36 month olds’ recognition of these categories in four conditions: Realistic; Features (only parts of the photo visible); Silhouettes; and Geons (a shape caricature version made with only 3-4 parts and no color or texture). Results show similar recognition for all Realistic and Silhouette versions; Geons were lower than the first two; and Features had the lowest recognition rate. Critically, categories with the highest variability in our previous study were readily recognized by Features but difficult to recognize in Geon version.

How do these patterns emerge? Experimental semiotics offers new empirical techniques to address such questions (Fay et al., 2008; Galantucci, 2005; Garrod et al., 2007; Kirby et al., 2008). We devised an experiment to observe the emergence of communicative conventions. The study explores the development of vocal communication systems through an iterative Vocal Charades game. The game is played by two players each given a stack of 12 cards. Written on each card is a word from six antonymic pairs (rough/smooth, bad/good, etc.). Over ten rounds, players took turns “vocalizing” the meaning of their words without using language or gestures. Analyses reveal how sounds conventionalize, leading to stereotyped forms and improved guessing. The conventional forms that develop are predicted by iconic correspondences with meaning, but also exhibit more arbitrary features that distinguish semantically similar words.",>Marcus Perlman>Rick Dale>Gary Lupyan,">University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, United States>University of California, Merced>University of Wisconsin Madison",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0895/index.html
2013,Perception of collaboration in joint musical performances,"Humans are exquisitely sensitive to social interactions. This study explored whether this extends to interactions in music performance. Jazz musicians are fluent at working together to produce music that is more than the sum of its parts, and listeners claim anecdotally to hear when musicians are ‘in the groove’. We employed jazz-standard duets varying in the opportunity for collaboration (two-way, one-way, none), to test listeners’ perception of collaboration. In experiment 1, participants rated random selections from these recordings in the dimensions of synergy, creativity, emotionality, and engagement. Results showed considerable sensitivity to collaboration, with sensitivity varying both with social intelligence and musical training of the participant. In experiment 2, participants made explicit judgments of whether the selections involved collaboration, with the results showing they could not. We conclude that the degree of collaboration in joint musical performances influences the implicit experience of listeners, but is not accessible for explicit judgments.",>Ana Pesquita>Timothy Corlis>James T.

2013,"I did not write you this before, did I? Destination Memory in Computer-Mediated Communication","In face-to-face communication people have problems recalling which facts they have disclosed to whom. We explore if such destination memory (DM) problems also exist in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Participants (N = 64) disclosed 50 pieces of personal information to 50 fictitious partners in a sham Skype environment in two conditions, one-sided “telling” and communicative “turn-taking”. Their recall for facts, faces, and fact-face-pairs was measured as dependent variables. ANOVA results show a significant main effect of type of recall (F (2,61) = 222.47, p < .001): recall for facts was better than for faces or fact-face-pairs, indicating that DM problems emerge when faces are previously unknown. Additionally, we found a significant main effect of conditions (F (1,62) = 6.75, p = .012): contrary to expectations recall in the “telling” condition was best.

2013,Structural Alignment in Young Children’s Shape Categorization: Different Roles for Learning from Comparisons and Contrasts,"Creating correct shape categories requires young children to overcome reliance on perceptual features and surface similarity as cues for membership and to use abstract rules as bases for categorization (e.g., triangles are enclosed shapes with three sides). Relying on surface similarity, children often wrongly include non-triangles that resemble familiar triangles in the triangle category, and exclude unfamiliar actual triangles. This study attempted to improve preschool-age children’s triangle categorizations by presenting structurally aligned comparisons that either shared a common structure or that highlighted a contrasting structure. Across both types of comparisons, the exemplars were either highly or lowly superficially similar (both variables manipulated between subjects). We hypothesized that low-similarity common-structure comparisons would support extension of the triangle category beyond prototypical exemplars, while high-similarity contrastive alignments would highlight category boundaries. Preliminary results suggested that improvement in categorization accuracy was primarily driven by a reduction in erroneous identification of a non-triangle as a triangle.",>Raedy Ping>Micah Goldwater>Bryan Matlen>Linsey Smith>Susan Levine>Dedre Gentner,>University of Chicago>Northwestern University>Carnegie Mellon University>Northwestern University>University of Chicago>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0898/index.html

Despite the vast amount of research on transfer and learning effect in problem-solving, as far as we know little to no work has been done on how failure to solve a problem affects subsequent problem-solving ability. The current experiment explores this issue and the role of working memory in the process. Two variables were manipulated – the experienced success or failure on a single multiplication problem and the amount of working memory resources required by the following addition problem. Results show negative impact of failure on subsequent process-time: the problem-solving time for the addition problem was higher for participants who failed to solve the multiplication problem. There was no interaction between experienced performance and the WM resources required by the subsequent problem. These results suggest that researchers must probably be careful to avoid fixation on failure as a confounding variable.",>Vencislav Popov,">New Bulgarian University

2013,Effects of Gestures while Studying Language Animations,"Two experiments will be presented. Experiment 1 examined whether simultaneously observing and making gestures while studying animations would lighten cognitive load and facilitate the acquisition of grammatical rules, as would be predicted by theories of embodied cognition and cognitive load. However, results showed that children in the gesturing condition performed worse on a subsequent test than children in the control condition. This was particularly true for children with low levels of general language skills, whereas children with high language skills experienced no detrimental effects of gesturing. Because simultaneously observing and making gestures hampered learning, the question is whether only observing gestures would be effective. Moreover, because it is still unclear whether seeing animated sentence transformations has a positive effect on learning, Experiment 2 compares the effects of three instructional conditions for both low and high-ability learners: static pictures, animation without observing gestures, and animation with observing gestures.",>Lysanne Post>Tamara van Gog>Fred Paas>Rolf Zwaan,">Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands>Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands>Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands>Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0900/index.html

At least some kinds of social imitative behavior, including gesture and pitch adaptation, appear to be triggered by direct eye gaze (Wang, Ramsey & Hamilton, 2011). Past research indicated that autistic individuals may have difficulties with both shared gaze focus and joint attention. Therefore, we might expect that their vocal imitative behavior would differ from the behavior of TD individuals.

2013,Semantic Intuitions in Statistical Causal Reasoning,"In psychology, philosophy, and linguistics there has been a debate about two competing frameworks of causal reasoning. Dependency theories, especially causal Bayes nets, focus on causally motivated statistical or counterfactual dependencies between events (causes and effects). In contrast, force dynamic theories implement causation as arising (deterministically) from force interactions involving agents impinging on the prior tendencies of patients. To date force dynamic theories have primarily focused on the representation of different semantic causal concepts in scene descriptions. Our goal is to bring the two competing frameworks together. We will present a model that implements the interaction between agents and patients in terms of probabilistic forces. We have tested this new model in an experiment in which we tested how contingency information interacts with the assumptions about intrinsic tendencies of patients in people’s usage of semantic causal concepts (e.g., CAUSE, PREVENT, HINDER, HELP, ALLOW, and ENABLE).",>Benjamin Quack>Ralf Mayrhofer>Michael Waldmann,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0902/index.html
2013,Simulating the N400 ERP component as semantic network error: Insights from a feature-based connectionist attractor model of word meaning,"The N400 ERP component is widely used in research on language and semantics, but the specific underlying mechanisms are currently unclear. We explored the mechanisms underlying the N400 by examining how a connectionist semantic network’s performance measures covary with N400 amplitudes. We simulated six N400 effects obtained in empirical research. Network error was consistently in the same direction as N400 amplitudes, namely smaller for high frequency words, words with few semantic features, semantically related targets and repeated words. Furthermore, the repetition-induced decrease was stronger for low frequency words and words with many features. In contrast, semantic activation corresponded less well with the N400, and instead seemed related to lexical decision performance. Our results suggest an interesting relation between N400 amplitudes and semantic network error. In psychological terms, network error has been conceptualized as implicit prediction error. Thus, N400 amplitudes may reflect implicit prediction error in semantic memory (McClelland, 1994).",>Milena Rabovsky>Ken McRae,>Humboldt University at Berlin>University of Western Ontario,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0903/index.html

We investigated this question using a task where participants were instructed to perform individual or joint movements in synchrony with individual or joint movements observed on a computer screen. The observed movements started slowly and then continuously increased in tempo (from 1.75 Hz to 3 Hz). The results showed that, with regard to spatial parameters, joint performance was more accurate when observing joint performance than when observing individual performance. Individual performance was more accurate when observing individual action than when observing joint action. There were no systematic differences with regard to timing parameters. These results suggest that mechanisms of temporal coordination may be less susceptible to differences between individual and joint action than mechanisms of spatial matching.",>Veronica Ramenzoni>Natalie Sebanz>Günther Knoblich,>Donders Institute for Cognition>Central European University>Central European University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0904/index.html

In an attempt to understand this phenomenon, we hypothesized that the cave environment “affords” such usage. In our experiment, 52 participants completed a survey about their metaphysical beliefs inside a room providing a great deal of natural light, while another 52 participants completed the same survey in a dark and windowless room. The survey asked participants to rate their beliefs in a variety of supernatural phenomena and also included multiple-choice questions which described bizarre scenarios that could be explained either scientifically or supernaturally. The supernatural responses to both the rating-scale questions and to the multiple-choice questions were significantly higher in the cave-like condition. These results are consistent with anthropological claims that the dark zones of caves may have played a role in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness that contributed to humans’ tendency toward magical thinking.",>Lillian Rigoli>Holley Moyes>Stephanie Huette>Michael Spivey,">University of California, Merced, San Diego, CA, United States>University Of California, Merced>University Of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0905/index.html
2013,Approximating the Value Function in the Actor Critic Architecture using the Temporal Dynamics of Spiking Neural Networks,"The human ability to learn from sparse rewards has been modeled with the temporal difference learning mechanism, using an actor-critic architecture (Montague, Dayan, & Sejnowski, 1996). These models incorporate an ""adaptive critic"" which learns a ""value function"": a mapping from the learner's current situation to expected future reward. In complex environments, a ""value function approximator"" (VFA) must be implemented to allow generalization between similar situations. While some implementations of VFAs have been successful (Tesauro, 1992), this approach does not consistently converge to a solution (Boyan and Moore, 1995). With the goal of developing a general and reliable VFA mechanism, capturing human level learning performance, we have explored the use of spiking neural networks, including liquid state machines, as a technique for VFA learning in complex environments. We report on simulations demonstrating the benefits and pitfalls of using the temporal dynamics of neural spikes to encode the learner's state.",>Jeffrey Rodny>David Noelle,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0906/index.html

In this study we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the time course and locus of frequency effects within the language production system. Furthermore, we tested whether frequency effects are related to non-lexical variables such as valence and arousal. We presented pictures and superimposed high and low-frequency distractors and additionally varied the emotional valence and arousal of the distractor words. The effects of distractor frequency in naming times and ERPs - starting at about 300 ms - were modulated by arousal, suggesting that non-lexical mechanisms can modulate distractor effects in the picture-word interference paradigm.",>Lana Rohr>Rasha Abdel Rahman,">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0907/index.html
2013,Bayesian Word Learning in Multiple Languages,"Infant language learners are faced with the difficult inductive problem of determining how new words map to novel or known objects in their environment. Bayesian inference models have been successful at using the sparse information available in natural child-directed speech to build candidate lexicons and infer speakers' referential intentions. We begin by showing that when a Bayesian model is optimized for monolingual input (Frank et al., 2009), the model does not sufficiently handle bilingual input, especially as referential ambiguity increases. Here we propose an extended Bayesian model that approximates infants' mutual exclusivity bias to support the differential demands of monolingual and bilingual learning situations. The extended model is assessed using corpora of real child-directed speech, showing that performance can be optimized for both monolingual and bilingual contexts. We show that including both monolingual and bilingual demands in model optimization yields significantly different results than when only one context is considered. Frank, M. C., Goodman, N.

In this study we investigated whether cognitive processing modes can affect lexical-semantic activation during single word production. Specifically, we tested whether prior processing of linguistic ambiguities, presented in the form of puns, has an influence on the co-activation of unrelated meanings of homophones in a subsequent language production task. In a picture-word interference paradigm with word distractors that were semantically related or unrelated to the non-depicted meanings of homophones we found facilitation induced by related words only when participants listened to puns before object naming, but not when they heard jokes with unambiguous linguistic stimuli. This finding suggests that a cognitive mode of ambiguity processing can induce the activation of ambiguous messages during speech planning.",>Sebastian Rose>Katharina Spalek>Rasha Abdel Rahman,">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0909/index.html
2013,Explanatory Reasoning in Causal-based Categorization,"Research on causal-based categorization focuses on how people categorize exemplars that have causally linked features. One prominent account, the generative model (Rehder, 2003) models membership judgments as a function of an exemplar's likelihood being generated by the category's causal model. In contrast, Mayrhofer and Rothe (2012) found that the explanatory role of the causal model strongly influences membership judgments - indicating the importance of explanatory reasoning processes and that in such tasks people might be guided by explanatory goodness (i.e., how well an exemplar's membership can be explained in the light of the category's causal relations). However, the evidence for this claim was quite indirect so far. In the present categorization study, we collected judgments about category membership, frequency, and explanatory goodness. In contrast to the predictions of the generative model, membership ratings are far better resembled by ratings of explanatory goodness than by subjects' estimations of exemplar likelihood.",>Anselm Rothe>Ralf Mayrhofer,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0910/index.html
2013,Learning in a different way: Interaction gestures influence category learning on multi-touch-tables,"This study investigated the influence of interaction gestures on learning using multi-touch-tables. During a learning phase, participants learned how to categorize Renaissance and Baroque paintings either by moving them over the display of the multi-touch-table or by tapping a marked field on the display representing an art epoch. In the testing phase, participants had to categorize paintings known from the learning phase and new paintings in a forced-choice task. The Gestural Conceptual Mapping approach argues that congruency between gesture and mental processes enhances learning. Due to the discrete nature of the categorization process, learning should benefit from a discrete tapping gesture. The Reality-based Interaction approach argues that gestures should map with interaction experiences in the real world to promote learning. Moving objects to places that represent categories can be considered similar to the real world experience of sorting objects and should facilitate category learning. The results support the latter approach.",>Susana Ruiz Fernández>Birgit Imhof>Julia Kranz>Stephan Schwan>Barbara Kaup>Peter Gerjets,>Leibniz Knowledge Media Research Center>Leibniz Knowledge Media Research Center>Leibniz Knowledge Media Research Center>Leibniz Knowledge Media Research Center>Psychological Institut University of Tübingen>Leibniz Knowledge Media Research Center,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0911/index.html
2013,Social interaction and group dynamics of virtual cooperative agents,"The challenge of integration of virtual agents and co-robots into the human society requires for these future artifacts to become human-compatible, in addition to being generally intelligent and capable of providing specific expertise. Specifically, a human-compatible agent should be able to induce in humans a sense of co-presence of a potentially equal mind capable of mutual understanding and human-like learning, long-term personal relationships and generous initiative. Achieving these qualities requires social emotional intelligence. In order to be able to implement equivalents of social emotions in artifacts, it is vital to better understand social interactions in small groups based on cognitive architectures like eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013). The present work makes one step further in this direction, continuing the development and computational exploration of the new framework for emotional cognitive architectures.

2013,Dimensional experience induces attention shifting in the dimensional change card sort (DCCS) task,"The dimensional change card sort (DCCS) task is a model paradigm for studying developmental change attention switching during childhood. In the DCCS, children are asked to sort two-dimensional cards (e.g., blue star) by one dimension and then again by the other. Typically, 3-year-olds fail to switch dimensions, continuing to sort the cards by the first dimension. Four-year-olds readily switch dimensions. The source of this sudden developmental change has been widely debated. A recent proposal is that only older children are able to selectively attend to one dimension, enabling them to flexibly switch the dimension along which they sort. We present results showing that experience matching values along one dimension prior to participating in the DCCS task facilitates 3-year-olds’ ability to switch dimensions. We implemented this experience in a dynamic neural field model of DCCS performance and found that it mimicked developmental change in dimensional attention in the model.",>Larissa Samuelson>Sammy Perone>Stephen Molitor>Aaron Buss>John Spencer,>University of Iowa>University of Iowa>University of Iowa>University of Iowa>University of Iowa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0913/index.html

Dynamic Field Theory offers a framework, in which cognitive processes and their development may be modeled quantitatively as dynamics of activation functions defined over behaviorally-relevant parameter spaces. Although learning through memory trace formation is an integral part of the DFT, the behavioral spaces are assumed to be given. However, these spaces may be shaped autonomously while acting in an environment. The autonomy of learning processes is achieved if the behavioral states have intentional structure, which sustains representations to enable learning and ensures their deactivation when appropriate. In this work, I show how intentional structure realized with Dynamic Neural Fields enables autonomous development of a sensorimotor mapping involved in looking behavior.",>Yulia Sandamirskaya,">Ruhr-Universität Bochum, INI, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0914/index.html
2013,Temporal discounting in a sequential search task,"Search requires individuals to balance exploration (finding new resources) with exploitation (making use of current resources) over time. How individuals perceive reward in a temporally extended search may significantly influence their explore/exploit decisions. Furthermore, how individuals perceive reward is related to impulsivity. Different aspects of impulsivity can lead to different predictions for people's search patterns. We tested some of these predictions in a search task with a non-depleting condition where resources would maintain value when exploited, and a depleting condition where resources lost value when exploited. Participants with larger temporal discounting rates (greater impulsivity) started exploiting depleting resources later than those with smaller discount rates, surprisingly appearing more patient and performing closer to the optimal level. However, this difference disappeared when resources were non-depleting. Greater impulsivity might make individuals more risk-seeking in the depleting search environment and thus explore depleting resources longer at the beginning phase of the search task.",>Ke Sang>Junyi Dai>Peter M.

2013,Reducing Behaviorism and Cognitivism,"Behaviorism and Cognitivism are two perspectives in cognitive science that have had significant impact in the evolution of mind theory. Behaviorism is centered in the study of mind from the perspective of externalized behavior. Behaviorism is opposed to the approach to mind analysis from an introspective point of view, even rejecting the existence of internal states. The cognitivist reaction explained some aspects of memory and learning that behaviorism failed to account for. Internal mental states –beliefs, values, intentions- are the common trade of cognitivist models. Cognitivism employs computer-based information processing as the paradigmatic principle sustaining cognitive modeling, where data structures implement the required internal mental states. These two approaches to cognitive science are usually considered as antagonistic; but they are not. The only difference is that they approach the problem of the modeling of mind from an input/output perspective or from a state-based perspective. Behaviorism focuses on using a black box model of minds while cognitivism focuses on white box models. Both are right and complementary approaches and are degenerate forms of a more fundamental approach that may be applied to mind modeling: systems identification.",>Ricardo Sanz,>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0916/index.html
2013,Modeling biconditionals: Equivalence in an uncertain world,"For almost a half century, it has been known that participants consider the truth value of “if p then q,” in a “defective” way, as true when p and q are both true, false when p is true but q is false, but uncertain whenever p is false. Recently, researchers has given this truth table a new normative status, under the theory of subjective probability by de Finetti, as of conditional event, q|p. On the basis of ample evidence that P(if p then q)=P(q|p), we study biconditionals, “if p then q, and if q then p.” Here we show the psychological priority of biconditional event to material equivalence. Additionally, we discuss the logical background of (bi-)conditional event and three types of uncertainty.

2013,Integrating Top-down and Bottom-up Approaches in Holistic Perceptual Categorization,"Perceptual categorization is a key problem for an agent to cope with its internal and external world. Following a functional and subjective approach of cognitive modeling, the primary purpose of perceptual categorization is modeled as the valuation of a stimulus regarding its potential to satisfy an agent’s current needs. Additionally an integrated and holistic approach is used, where categorization considers the integration of subjective influences. Such an approach complies with the consideration of top-down perception and priming. Using an activation-based exemplar model, the objective criterion of perceptual similarity, which represents bottom-up aspects of perception, and the subjective expectation-based criterion of cathexis, which represents top-down aspects of perception, are integrated in a holistic multi-criteria model of perceptual categorization. An Artificial Life simulation demonstrates the model’s ability to relate stimulus objects to an agent’s internal needs.

Mind wandering is usually treated as a dichotomy and often measured using self-reports. We here propose the levels-of-inattention hypothesis, postulating graded decoupling at different processing levels. To measure levels of decoupling during reading we introduce the sustained attention to stimulus task (SAST), which relies on psychophysics of error detection. We found that subjects were less likely to notice errors at higher levels of cognitive processing. Eye tracking showed that before errors were overlooked effects of high- and low-level linguistic variables were reduced in a graded fashion, indicating episodes of weak and deep decoupling. Individual gaze durations predicted overlooking of errors five seconds before they occurred. Our findings support the levels-of-inattention hypothesis and suggest levels of mind wandering can be measured in the SAST.

One possibility is that the metalinguistic tasks typically used only uncover conscious, controlled comprehension processes. We tested the hypothesis that chronic RHLs would show a deficit in a task that taps automatic processes, even if their performance on a metalinguistic task was not abnormal. Nine RHL were tested on a sentence/matching-word lexical decision priming task with literal and metaphorical sentences and a short SOA. Nine left hemisphere lesion patients and thirteen age and education matched healthy adults served as controls. A two-way mixed ANOVA revealed a main effect of sentence type (F(1,28) = 7.0, p = .01) but no effect of group. All three groups showed larger priming effects for literal sentences (M=70ms SD=70ms) than for metaphorical sentences (M=34ms, SD=68ms).

Forty two-year-old children and forty five-year-old children and their mothers were video-recorded in two conversational settings. Measures were obtained for the mothers' speech complexity (mlu, use of verbs, complex sentences, and direct objects), their emotional prosody (pitch, pitch variability), and their pointing gestures. Mothers of 5-year-olds used more complex speech than mothers of 2-year-olds, whereas mothers of 2-year-olds showed more emotional prosody, and pointed more often than mothers of five-year-olds. This is interpreted as an adaptation to their children's conversational abilities. As younger children do not understand very complex utterances, but might rely on more nonverbal communication (such as pointing gestures and emotional prosody) than older children, their mothers might use a less verbally complex, but rather emotionally rich and non-verbally sophisticated interaction style.",>Tanja Schorch>Jens Brauer,">Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Sachsen, Germany>Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Sachsen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0922/index.html

This hypothesis was confirmed in an experiment based on a 2x2 design with picture presentation prior to text (yes vs. no) and visuo-spatial secondary task (with vs. without) as independent variables: Learners without pictures showed a higher load of the visuo-spatial sketchpad (i.e., higher interference with the secondary task) during text processing than learners with pictures, presumably because the former generated mental images during reading. This interpretation is supported by the finding that pictures were especially helpful for learners with low imagery capacity. The implications of these results are discussed.",>Anne Schüler>Katharina Scheiter,>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0923/index.html
2013,We never walk alone: The influence of social interaction on wayfinding behavior,"When people move through large-scale environments, they use multiple strategies to find their ways. While many studies have investigated individual wayfinding strategies, in naturalistic settings people usually don’t navigate alone, but search for their destinations in pairs or small groups. Having a shared goal can have an impact on the perception of the scene, the attentional focus and the behavior of the individual participant. We investigate how social interaction influences navigation behavior and focus on a cooperative scenario. We developed a joint wayfinding paradigm to measure walking trajectories, walking speed, gaze behavior and speech data in a naturalistic indoor setting. We use two mobile eyetracking devices to analyse the behavior of pairs of participants solving wayfinding tasks. We’ll present data on the impact of participants’ cooperation behavior on perceptual and attentional processes and wayfinding strategies.",>Sarah Schwarzkopf>Rul von Stülpnagel>Christoph Hölscher,>Center for Cognitive Science Freiburg>Center for Cognitive Science Freiburg>ETH Zurich Cognitive Science,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0924/index.html
2013,Does the listener keeps spatial information from the speaker’s cohesive gestures to comprehend subsequent sentences without gestures?,"This study examined whether listeners keep spatial story representation created by speaker’s cohesive gestures beyond the concurrent sentence. Participants were presented with three-sentence discourse with two protagonists, in the first and second sentences, the gestures consistently assigned the two protagonists in either right or left of the gesture space. The third sentence (without gestures) referred to one of the protagonists, and the participants responded with one of the two keys to indicate the relevant protagonist. The response keys were either spatially congruent or incongruent with the gesturally established locations for the two participants. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the performance in the congruent condition was better than that in the incongruent condition. Thus, listeners make a spatial story representation based on the gestures, and the spatial representation persists beyond the concurrent sentence, and the information is still activated in a subsequent sentence without a gesture.",>Kazuki Sekine>Sotaro Kita,>University of Birmingham>University of Birmingham,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0925/index.html
2013,The influence of spatial cueing on serial order visual memory,"In this study we manipulated colors and shapes in different blocks in order to investigate the differential effect of stable spatial cues on color and shape recall. The task involves recency judgment where two items from the stream of serially presented stimuli are shown and the subjects have to respond by indicating which of them came later in the sequence. Our studies show a clear dissociation between color and shape recall. While spatial cues seem to facilitate shape recall, they seem to degrade the color recall performance. This effect becomes significant for shape-location trials beyond the working memory capacity limit of 4 items. The results can be interpreted as if individuation of colored objects draws from the same attentional resources as spatial attention and the resulting competition degrades performance in serial order judgment involving color whereas shape recall does not seem to be subject such competition.",>Rakesh Sengupta>Anvita Gopal>Prajit Basu>David Melcher>Raju Bapi,">Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hyderabad Hyderabad-500046, India>Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hyderabad Hyderabad-500046, India>Dept of Philosophy, School of Humanities & Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hyderabad Hyderabad-500046, India>Center for Mind/Brain Sciences, University of Trento Rovereto-38068, Italy>School of CIS & Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hyderabad Hyderabad-500046, India",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0926/index.html
2013,Physical Skill and Idea Interaction in the Creation of New Dance Movements,"It has been suggested that in creative activities, cognition and physical action are related to each other. This study focuses on this relationship in breakdance, which is a creative activity of artistic and acrobatic movements. For four months, we conducted field observations of practice sessions of three expert breakdancers, and held interviews with them to investigate the creation process of new and original movements. The video records of the 34 practices and the interview data were analyzed with respect to two aspects: 1) Whether or not the dancers performed important movements appropriately; and 2) What the dancers were thinking when generating new aspects of the movements. The results show an interactive process between the development of dance movements and the generation of ideas. The dancers gradually became able to perform the movements appropriately by generating new ideas, and they generated new ideas using the somatic sensation of the new movements.",>Daichi Shimizu>Takeshi Okada,">University of Tokyo, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, Japan>University of Tokyo, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0927/index.html
2013,The effect of metacognitive strategies during reviewing,"A peer-based reviewing on writing often leads to improving learners’ writing quality. Particularly, reviewing by writing comments lifted writing quality more greatly than reviewing without writing comments. This implies that learners’ hard working on peers’ writing engenders benefits on their own writing. This study attempted to explore which cognitive mechanism underlies in this cooperative learning system. We questioned whether learners’ use of metacognitive strategies during reviewing might facilitate learners’ self-learning. In a preliminary study, participants were asked to categorize their comments on peers’ reports. Results from the study revealed that learners who categorized comments used metacognitive strategies more increasingly than those who did not. Controlling for the amount of using metacognitive strategies, writing quality was improved numerically more when learners were engaged in the categorization task than when they were not. With further data, we will examine to what degree learners’ metacognitive learning during reviewing contribute to writing improvement.",>Hocheol Shin>Hongoak Yun>Jungsun Yoo>Kwangsu Cho,>Sungkyunkwan University>Sungkyunkwan University>Sungkyunkwan University>Sungkyunkwan University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0928/index.html
2013,Foot Movement for Walking Biases the Visual Attention Allocation,"Precise walking requires ample cognitive resource to control balance in the single leg stance while head moves periodically in the vertical axis within each stride cycle. Because visual information is a key factor in motor control, we hypothesize that walking alters the allocation of visual attention, thereby affecting the selective intake of visual information. Participants localized a peripheral dot while identifying the central letter in a display during treadmill walking, stepping in place, and standing still. Vertical head movement occurred only in the walking condition. Results show that visual attention was skewed in the single leg stance during walking and stepping in place. Vertical head movement affected the allocation of visual attention because only in the walking condition was attention oriented downward without skewing during the double leg stance. Cognitive resources and head vertical movement appear to work differently in adaptation of visual attention to walking.",>Marie Shoda>Kazuhiko Yokosawa,">The university of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan>The University of Tokyo",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0929/index.html

To explore how neighborhoods can vary both within and across multiple languages, we have developed CLEARPOND (the Cross-Linguistic Easy-Access Resource for Phonological and Orthographic Neighborhood Densities), a database of phonological and orthographic neighborhood information for five languages: Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish. Analyses using the CLEARPOND database revealed consistent effects of lexical frequency and word-length on neighborhood size across languages, while also highlighting how the languages differed in the distribution of neighbor-types (phonological/orthographic). CLEARPOND not only provides a tool that can be used to study differences between languages but also provides detailed information about characteristics of individual words in multiple languages.

2013,Thematic Music and Context Interact to Affect Inclusion of Schematic Elements During Story Generation,"Listening to a 90-sec excerpt of thematic music (e.g., baby music) affects performance in a subsequent generation task by increasing the likelihood that concepts associated with the thematic music (e.g., “Sleep,” “Baby”) will be incorporated into the novel product (Sifonis & Fuss, 2012). The generation task theme (e.g., writing a story about a visit to an alien planet versus writing about a visit to an undiscovered, foreign land) also interacts with the music theme to affect the degree to which concepts associated with the music are incorporated into the generated product. The current study tested and supported the hypothesis that listening to thematic music activates complex schematic structures. The generation task theme provides context, thus affecting the specific manifestation of the thematic elements in the generation task (e.g., including concepts associated with a foreign land with many children versus those associated with an alien planet with many children).",>Cynthia Sifonis,>Oakland University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0931/index.html
2013,Embodied Mental Imagery,"A new theory of visuo-spatial mental imagery and a computational model of the theory are presented. The theory assumes (visual) perception to be an active and guided process comprising of several low-level perceptual actions. Mental concepts are grounded in sets of such actions. Imagery comprises the ""offline"" employment of these actions providing concrete instances of the mental concepts through bodily feedback such as proprioception. The theory is compared to the contemporary theories and evaluated against a set of well established phenomena, i.e., mental scanning, mental reinterpretation, eye movements, unilateral neglect. It is argued that the theory provides explanations that go beyond those offered by the contemporary theories. The results provide support for the explanatory power of an embodied approach to cognition in which sensorimotor interaction constitutes conceptual knowledge in that it provides grounding and concrete manifestation of the semantics of mental concepts in the domain of visuo-spatial mental imagery.",>Jan Frederik Sima,>University of Bremen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0932/index.html
2013,Collaborative Recall and Extended identity in Twitter communication,"The aims of the current study are to analyze research evidence of the ways in which collective recall exhibits extended social identity effects . Our core hypothesis was that the use of Twitter as a recall tool significantly contributes to social identity generation in general and self-categorization in particular. Based on a study of a representative sample of Latvian-language Twittersphere, we argue that a social network serves a two-fold role: (a) it extends the individual self as part of a distributed social reality and as part of a distributed on-line social network. The core results of our study show that Twitter functions as an extended distributive linguistic cognitive system supporting different kinds of recall tasks while at the same time exhibiting strong categorization effects through eliminating redundant information and reducing the descriptive complexity of the environment in recall.",>Jurģis Šķilters>Līva Brice>Krista Bērziņa>Uldis Bojārs>Monika Kreile>Marta Selecka,>University of Latvia>University of Latvia>University of Latvia>University of Latvia>University of Oxford>University of Latvia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0933/index.html
2013,Probing the neural dynamics of visual working memory with dynamic fields and fMRI,"Efficient visually-guided behavior depends on our ability to form, retain, and compare visual representations that may be separated in space and time. This ability relies on visual working memory (VWM). Here, we describe a layered neural architecture that captures the cortical population dynamics that underlie VWM. We then test this model using functional neuroimaging. Recent work has shown that the BOLD response is strongly correlated with local field potentials (LFPs). An analog of LFPs can be estimated from dynamic neural field (DNF) models. This estimate can be convolved with an impulse response function to yield time-dependent hemodynamic predictions. Using this approach, we show that the DFN model quantitatively captures fMRI data from recent studies probing changes in the BOLD response in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) as set size increases in change detection. We also test a novel prediction of the model that BOLD responses should be greater on false alarms versus misses. These data run counter to common explanations of the origin of errors in change detection.",>John Spencer>Aaron Buss>Vincent Magnotta,>University of Iowa>University of Iowa>University of Iowa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0934/index.html
2013,Looking at an empty side of the world. Hemispheric specialisation in directing language-mediated eye movements.,"We investigated the relationship between linguistic and visual information, combining divided visual field and blank screen paradigms. In an eye-tracking experiment, two objects appeared for 180 ms, one in the right (rvf) and one in the left visual field (lvf), while participants maintained central fixation. After the objects disappeared, a word was presented auditorily. In matching trails (50%), it indicated one of the objects previously shown. Participants had to decide whether the word named a man-made or a natural entity. Findings revealed that they were more likely to saccade toward the side of the referent object when it had been presented in the lvf than in the rvf. Moreover, saccades in the lvf targeted more precisely the object’s empty location. This suggests a crucial role of the right hemisphere in activating visual representations during language processing, indicating its greater ability in using spatial indexes to retrieve useful visual information.",>Sara Spotorno>Jens Apel>Bérengère Plaza>Sylvane Faure,">University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom and University of Aix-Marseille, Marseille, France>University of Wuppertal, Germany>University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France>University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0935/index.html
2013,How common ground affects the use of gesture space,"Recent work has started to ask to what degree common ground, i.e. shared background knowledge, may affect the articulation of co-speech gestures, specifically as regards viewpoint. We extend that work by asking how gesture articulation is affected, and how the spatial location of those gestures changes as a result of common ground. Using naturalistic data, we find that with quotes grounded in past interactions, co-speech gestures are fewer and smaller, whereas with quotes ungrounded in past interactions (UGPI), co-speech gestures are more numerous and larger. Moreover, when speakers repeatedly reference the same entity, the co-speech gestures used become smaller with each repeated reference, thereby suggesting a kind of ‘online’ grounding. We also find that the use of gestural space is more consistent for UGPI utterances. This suggests that common ground affects both the articulation of gestures, and the way that gesture space is used.",>Kashmiri Stec>Mike Huiskes,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0936/index.html

Taiwanese and American children were both under 50% correct for the concepts of area and volume in October. By May, Taiwanese children learned 90% of the targeted concepts. American children were still under 50% correct. During the following year, U.S. children received five weeks of instruction on linear, square, and cubic measure, or they received no instruction. Results showed significant increases on accurate knowledge of all measurement concepts, average score = 89%. Improvement was related, at the .72 level, to memory for forward going digit span. The control group did not improve on any type of measurement concept, despite their similar scores on memory for digit span. A third study showed that repeated practice on multiplication lowered the effects that digit span memory has on learning measurement concepts.",>Nancy L Stein>Yuhtsuen Tzeng>Linda Siegel,>University of Chicago ( U of C)>National Chung Cheng University>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0937/index.html
2013,Eye motion along a static concrete object: Why “fictive motion” is not a figurative mental phenomenon,"Fictive motion (specifically the co-extension path type: “The road runs through the desert”) is widely considered a specific class of figurative language. However, cognitive-linguistic and conceptual-metaphoric evidence is presented which suggests that linguistically expressed motion in fictive motion implicitly refers to the processing of a concrete action: to eye motion that occurs while scanning along a static visual percept (or mental image). As such, fictive motion differs principally from genuinely figurative expressions like ARGUMENT IS WAR – the figurative element of the latter cannot be interpreted as referring directly to a physically existing action or object. Also demonstrated is how a “non-figurative” theoretical approach to fictive motion can explain and predict so-called “non-fictive motion”; fictive motion-like temporal cognition; and fictive-motion types other than co-extension path. It is also shown how the various experimental cognitive and neurocognitive findings on fictive motion can be (re)interpreted in the new framework.",>Kurt Stocker,>University of Zurich,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0938/index.html
2013,No adaptive strategy selection without outcome feedback,"A common view in the judgment and decision making literature is that humans posses a repertoire of decision strategies, from which we choose adaptively when dealing with decision situations. Modeling this adaptive strategy selection process has proved to be difficult, but advances were recently made by modeling it as a reinforcement learning process. Dieckmann and Rieskamp (2007) investigated the influence of information redundancy in a multiple-cue learning setting and found surprising evidence for adaptive strategy selection in situations without outcome feedback, which is difficult to explain by a pure reinforcement learning model. We challenge these findings by pointing out problems in their experimental design. We replicate their experiment, add conditions with stricter experimental controls, and investigate possible underlying mechanisms. In conditions with stricter controls we find no evidence that participants manage to incorporate information redundancy into strategy selection and conclude there is no adaptive strategy selection without outcome feedback.",>Hrvoje Stojic>Henrik Olsson,">Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0939/index.html

Raters in social situations such as these must battle with their own uncertainty if they are to make a judgment, yet lie detection research has given little attention to the effects of uncertainty. We present evidence suggesting prior knowledge and expectations have an early influence on the judgment process, but only when forced into judgment. If able to abstain, raters do not rely on prior knowledge but rather indicate their uncertainty by withholding judgment until all the available information has been presented. After the speaker has presented their statement, and when no additional new information is available, we provide evidence from a number of experiments that lie detectors integrate their pre-existing biases and experience about deception in general with more specific information about the statement at hand.",>Chris N.H.

2013,An Attentionally Constrained Model of Statistical Word Learning,"Recent research supports the notion that word learning can be conceptualized as a statistical learning process. As many have noted however, statistical learning is constrained by processes such as attention and memory. Here we tested an attentionally constrained framework of statistical word learning. We observed, through infant-perspective head cameras, infants’ visual input as parents labeled novel objects during an infant-parent object-play session. We then constructed statistical learning models that aggregate word-to-object associations. We fed a baseline model the word-to-object co-occurrence patterns obtained from parent-infant observations. We fed an attentionally constrained model weighted co-occurrence patterns based on the perceptual properties of the objects (i.e., object sizes from the infant’s view) at the time words were uttered. Models’ learning was compared to children’s forced-choice test results. Of interest is which of the two models best approximates children’s learning. Implications of these results for statistical learning accounts of word learning will be discussed.",>Sumarga Suanda>Seth Foster>Linda Smith>Chen Yu,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0941/index.html
2013,The time course of structural and number interference in sentence processing,"In sentence processing, retrieval cue parsing accounts predict that processing difficulty occurs due to interference between similar noun phrases at verb integration (Van Dyke & Lewis, 2003; Van Dyke, 2007). An important factor is number marking of the nouns because the number of the verb and the subject has to agree. According to Lewis and Vasishth (2005), different types of retrieval cue overlap (e.g., verb subcategorisation, semantics, number) should all cause interference simultaneously during processing. However, Van Dyke (2007) reported that interference due to subcategorisation overlap preceded semantic interference, suggesting that syntactic interference may occur before interference due to other cues. We investigated whether interference due to number overlap also occurs later than interference due to subcategorisation overlap. Interestingly, using eye-tracking, we found that the number congruency effect occurred early and no later than the subcategorisation interference effect, indicating that number interference has a very rapid effect on sentence processing.",>Katja Suckow>Roger van Gompel,">School of Psychology, University of Dundee>School of Psychology, University of Dundee",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0942/index.html
2013,Imagining emotions: An ERP study on mental imagery of facial expressions,"Affective stimuli encountered in everyday life - such as emotional words, scenes or facial expressions - can elicit well-investigated emotional experiences. For instance, two distinct event-related brain potentials (ERPs) have been reported in response to emotional facial expressions, an early posterior negativity (EPN), associated with enhanced attention and perception of affective stimuli, and a later centro-parietal positivity (LPP), assumed to reflect processing of the intrinsic relevance of emotional stimuli. Other rich sources of emotions that have yet received little attention in EEG research are internal mental events such as thoughts, memories and imagination. Here we investigated mental imagery of emotional facial expressions and its time course using ERPs. We presented participants with neutral faces and asked them to imagine the faces with an emotional or neutral expression. Early ERP modulations during imagery resemble the effects frequently reported for emotional facial expressions, suggesting shared early processes underlying emotion perception and imagination.",>Franziska Suess>Rasha Abdel Rahman,>Humboldt-University of Berlin>Humboldt-University of Berlin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0943/index.html

Previous studies revealed that certain factors, such as strategies and goals, affect wayfinding behavior and map learning. We focused on perspective preference as analyzed through measurement of eye movements, which enables us examine potential differences in spatial learning. We divided university students into a survey or route preference group through a map-learning questionnaire. While participants studied the maps, we measured participants’ eye movements to each map element (landmarks, streets, and compass rose). After studying a map, participants completed verification tasks and wrote their own map of the learned environment. In contrast to our prediction, the survey and route groups did not show the difference in regard to their gaze to most of the map elements. Although results did not emerge as expected, we discuss the effect of perspective preference on map learning and memory.",>Masashi Sugimoto>Takatsugu Kojima>Hiroyuki Tsuda>Shogo Kajimura>Ayae Iwamoto>Yuki Sato>Takashi Kusumi,>Kyoto University>Shiga University of Medical Science>Kyoto University>Kyoto University>Kyoto University>Kyoto University>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0944/index.html
2013,Finding Structure in Space and Time: Active Trace of Patterns,"In extracting statistical regularities from the seemingly random environment, our minds grow special interests in patterns. To account for such a behavior, much research has been focusing on top-down influences such as the representativeness heuristic and Bayesian belief updating. Here we take a reverse-engineering approach by first examining the waiting time statistics and the self-overlap property of patterns and revealing a normative basis for people's special attention to patterns. With a unsupervised neural network simulation, we show that different patterns may leave different traces in mind corresponding to the waiting time statistics, indicating an early pattern dissociation without any top-down guidance. We argue that the sense of randomness could have started locally with short sequences and emerged early at the perceptual level, and, the process of spatial-temporal association may be the early driving force towards a structured hypothesis space.",>Yanlong Sun>Hongbin Wang,>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0945/index.html
2013,Cognitive inhibition and the unbelievability of supernatural ideas,"After decades of research, the reason why people are attracted to the supernatural (paranormal, magical, superstitions) is poorly understood. It is possible that the question has been approached from the wrong angle and that it is skepticism that needs to be explained, not the beliefs. Taking this as a starting point, we examined (N = 40) whether skeptics have stronger cognitive inhibition than believers. Because cognitive load disrupts inhibition and reveals intuitive thinking, we hypothesized that working memory load increases ontological confusions less among skeptics than among believers. Ontological confusions, such as conceiving of lifeless objects as having mental states, are known to be central to supernatural beliefs. The results supported the hypothesis. Strong cognitive inhibition may thus partly explain why supernatural beliefs, albeit based on natural information processing, seem so unbelievable to millions of people.

Category recall tasks have been used to investigate memory as a search process, where memory is conceptualized as a landscape with distributed resources (resources being the target items of memory recall). Rhodes and Turvey (2007) show that the dynamics of memory search are akin to animal foraging behavior. Specifically, patterns of recall exhibited Lévy processes, which have been observed in many species and at many scales, and are hypothesized to be optimal under certain conditions. Here, we investigate the effects of social context on Lévy processes using a collaborative category recall task.

The traditional hypothesis claims that in order to act dishonestly one has to first overcome the truth bias, which results in more time and effort. The opposing hypothesis indicates that lying in order to serve self-interest is an automatic tendency, and therefore takes less time than refraining from lying. The goal is to look at the action dynamics of dishonesty in order to investigate its underlying cognitive processes. Subjects were asked to privately predict the outcome of a virtual coin-flip. After observing the actual outcome they reported whether their prediction was correct or wrong. The movements of the mouse towards the target answer were recorded and used for action dynamic analysis.

The results of this study showed the effect of metaphor, and indicated two points: (1) the effect of metaphor provide a meaning-searching process that showed a delayed reading time of sentences that describe important information regarding a text topic, and (2) this effect was shown in the case of unfamiliar metaphors, and not familiar metaphors.",>Tomohiro Taira,>Osaka City University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0949/index.html

In order to capture the progress of the formation process of an art concept, we conducted a case study of a contemporary artist. We interviewed a professional artist about his creation process once every three weeks for about ten months. This report focuses on an early phase of the search for ideas, in which he took many photographs to collect visual information to form the core part of the art concept. Using both the photographs he took and the interview data collected during this phase, we identify when and how features of his art concept emerged. The results show that his art concept was formed through cycles of two types of search for visual information: an active, explorative search to find the unexpected, and more a focused search to interpret it.",>Kikuko Takagi>Takeshi Okada>Sawako Yokochi,>The University of Tokyo>The University of Tokyo>Tokyo Future University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0950/index.html
2013,"Bounded rationality leads to optimal decision-making and learning under uncertainty: Satisficing, prospect theory, and comparative valuation breaking the speed-accuracy tradeoff","Some classically rational standards for actions such as optimization are simply intractable. We often instead satisfice a certain reference level that is good enough for us. We can use some heuristics but they may lead to biases. Though rational analysis by Anderson (1990) can argue the adaptive rationality of biases in relation to the environmental structure, heuristics and biases have been mostly studied in isolation from other factors in conformity with the tradition in psychology. To show the efficacy of the subrational heuristics in union, we execute computer simulations adopting the framework of reinforcement learning that models iterative decision-making under uncertainty. We implement three characteristics representative of human behavior: Satisficing (Simon, 1952), risk attitudes and reflection (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981), and comparative valuation (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). We show that they, combined together, exhibit an adaptively optimal behavior with an extremely easy parameter tuning.",>Tatsuji Takahashi>Kuratomo Oyo>Yu Kohno,">Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Denki University>Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Denki University>Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Denki University

It has not been well considered in the context of communication. We conducted a graphical communication experiment to investigate displacement in communication. In this experiment, two adults are paired, and a sender drew an absent object expressed by an unconventional combination of two words, adjective and noun, while a receiver answered what the drawing represented. This process was repeated 8 times for one object in each pair. The senders usually drew two pictures corresponding to two words, respectively. The analysis of results indicated that nouns should be understood in advance for understanding adjectives which are difficult to represent by drawings.

To gain insights into the nature of these processes, we had participants think aloud while following Origami instructions (verbal and pictorial). Our analysis of participants’ verbalizations revealed recurring patterns that reflect the underlying cognitive processes. Namely it showed evidence of reading and reformulating the task description, considering actions and task status, comparing task status to instructional pictures, evaluating progress, referring to previous experience, recognizing problems, and adding ideas about the current instructional step. The last two categories highlight how participants conceptualized this spatial task. The verbalizations also reflect a typical order that the cognitive processes follow: reading – reformulating – reconceptualizing – evaluating. The recurring pattern in this ordering suggests that participants gradually moved away from the original instruction towards a broader conceptualization for action in the current context.",>Thora Tenbrink>Holly A.

2013,"The contribution of frequency, phonological and semantic factors in the development of the English past tense.","Despite a vast amount of research, debate continues concerning the mechanisms underlying correct use of morphological systems such as the English past tense. Relatively little is known about precisely what, when, and how children acquire aspects of inflectional morphology due to the paucity of studies examining the earliest stages of development, and the generally narrow focus on a small number of items and predictors. To address these problems, we provide comprehensive evidence concerning the earliest stages of development. 543 English-speaking children (196 2-year-olds, 176 3-year-olds, 171 4-year-olds) took part in a past tense elicitation task. Responses were elicited for 300 verbs (200 for 2-yr-olds) and measures derived (largely from child-directed-speech) for a wide range of frequency, phonological and semantic predictor variables. We present the outcomes of analyses relating these novel predictor variables to the unique behavioural dataset, revealing the cognitive and linguistic underpinnings of children’s early past tense development.",>Anna Theakston>Grzegorz Krajewski>Sarah Keeble>Anna Woollams,">University of Manchester, United Kingdom>University of Warsaw, Poland>University of Manchester, United Kingdom>University of Manchester, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0954/index.html
2013,Accommodating talker-specific phonetic detail: Influences on internal category structure,"Listeners customize speech processing to accommodate talker-specific phonetic variation. For example, listeners modify established phonetic boundaries to incorporate a talker’s idiosyncratic productions. In addition to being marked by boundaries, phonetic categories exhibit a graded internal structure, with some members of the category considered better members than others. Here we examined whether sensitivity to talker-specific phonetic variation influences internal category structure. Two groups of listeners heard a talker produce /k/. Word-initial voice-onset-time (VOT) was manipulated such that one group heard the talker produce /k/ with shorter VOTs relative to the other. Listeners were then presented with a range of VOTs and asked to rate each for goodness as /k/. Results to date indicate that exposure during training robustly influences the range of VOTs considered the best exemplars of /k/, suggesting that accommodating talker-specific phonetic variation results in a comprehensive re-mapping of acoustic-phonetic space and is not limited to the boundary region.",>Rachel Theodore>Emily Myers>Janice Lomibao,>University of Connecticut>University of Connecticut>University of Connecticut,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0955/index.html
2013,A Neuro-Computational Approach to Equivalence Formation in Arbitrary Categories,"The Stimulus Equivalence paradigm studies the learning of stimulus classes (categories) composed of functionally equivalent stimuli with or without perceptual similarities. The relations between stimuli in a class can either be learned or be derived from other stimulus relations: if stimulus A is equivalent to B, and B to C, then the equivalence between A and C can be derived without explicit training. There has been little work on the mechanisms underlying equivalence class formation. Here we present a neurobiologically plausible neural network model of stimulus class learning. The network successfully models three classic studies on stimulus equivalence. The Hebbian weights in the model describe the formed equivalences and the levels of association between class members, and resulting activation patterns are correlated with the response accuracy and response latencies in the original studies. The model predicts that stimulus equivalence formation depends on the environmental regularities of stimuli occurrence and co-occurrence.",>Angel E.

2013,Coordination among edge team members during crisis management,"Crisis management (CM) situations are most-often complex and dynamic, and require team members to make optimal decisions under constraints of high risk, uncertainty, high workload, and time pressure (see, e.g., Brehmer, 2007). An Edge Organization (EO) is an adaptive, rapidly reconfigurable, and distributed team structure in which no roles are previously assigned, and resources are not distributed in advance. Such a team structure is assumed to be able to improvise and respond quickly to emerging problems. We used the C3Fire CM simulation to measure the coordination (of units and resources) efficiency amongst edge team members. Twenty-four teams of four participants completed four C3Fire scenarios, each lasting 10 minutes. Results revealed that team members achieved better coordination as they progressed through the scenarios. This learning effect suggests that it could be beneficial to train team members to coordinate their actions efficiently and fully exploit the potential agility provided by EO.",>Sebastien Tremblay>Isabelle Turcotte>Alexandre Labrecque>Jessica Desrochers-Pare>Vincent Rousseau,>Universite Laval>Universite Laval>Universite Laval>Universite Laval>University of Montreal,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0957/index.html
2013,Visual landmarks and the visual impedance effect,"According to Lynch (1960; p. 83) “the sequence [of landmarks] facilitates recognition and memorization”. Thus, under which circumstances do landmarks facilitate wayfinding? We therefore investigated the helpfulness of landmarks during route knowledge and survey knowledge retrieval from long-term memory. A field study with citizens of a street festival in a mid-size German town (Giessen) was performed. Sixty-three participants had to draw the shortest possible route between two given locations in the town. Within this experiment, two different conditions were tested respectively: drawing the route without landmarks and with additionally presented landmarks. A comparison of conditions revealed different performance groups: perfect performance (8%); performance improvement with additional landmarks (32%); equal performance in both conditions (36%); and performance decrement with additional landmarks (23%). These results were confirmed in two further experiments. We demonstrate that the decremental findings may be a result of the so-called visual impedance effect (Knauff & Johnson-Laird, 2002).",>Kai Hamburger>Florian Roeser>Cate Marie Trillmich,>Justus Liebig University Giessen; Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University Giessen; Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science>Justus Liebig University Giessen; Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0958/index.html

We manipulated the congruency of the quantifier of the conclusion with those of the two premises according to the matching strategy and the validity of the syllogism. After each syllogistic evaluation task, a lexical decision task was used to check if the semantic content of the conclusions was inhibited. The results suggested that after correctly solved conflict problems (match-invalid or mismatch-valid), the semantic priming effect of the words related to the two terms in the conclusion diminished. For no-conflict problems, the recognition time of the related words was faster than that of the unrelated words. The results suggested that inhibition on the content of a syllogism may not only be triggered by the conflict induced by the believability but also by the surface structure of the syllogisms.",>Ping Ping Tse>Sergio Moreno-Rios>Juan Antonio Garcia-Madruga>Maria Teresa Bajo,>Universidad de Granada>Universidad de Granada>Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia>Universidad de Granada,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0959/index.html
2013,Framing effects in perceptual decision-making,"Research on the psychology of simple, perceptual choices has led to an impressive progress in capturing the underlying mental processes as optimal mechanisms. Within this theoretical framework, perceptual decisions arise from a feed-forward process involving the sampling and accumulation of momentary evidence up to a decision boundary. According to this view, the stage where the information is accumulated is automatic and decision makers can exert strategic control on the decision boundary only, in order to adapt their performance to the task demands (e.g. speed-accuracy trade-offs). We present new behavioural and eye-tracking data challenging this view and suggesting that the way information is accumulated in perceptual decisions, is subject to differential weighing that depends on the task framing (e.g. select the brightest or the darkest spot). We conclude that choices are mostly influenced by extreme values, and whether positive or negative peaks are more pivotal is frame-dependent and subject to top-down control.",>Konstantinos Tsetsos>Christopher Summerfield,">Experimental Psychology, Oxford University>Experimental Psychology, Oxford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0960/index.html
2013,Differences between maximizers and satisficers in regret and counterfactual thinking during repeated versus switching decisions,"Recent research has demonstrated that with a positive prior experience, an actor who decides to switch decisions should feel more regret than one who decides to repeat (the status quo effect). Conversely, with a negative prior experience, the switcher should feel less regret than the repeater (reversal of the status quo). We tested the influence of a maximizing tendency on the strength of these two effects, measured using the Japanese version of the Regret and Maximization Scale. In the positive prior experience scenario, the maximizer group scored higher on presumed regret and counterfactual thinking than the satisficer group. In the status quo scenario, the maximizer group scored higher on counterfactual happiness than the satisficer group. Our results indicate that maximizers show a reversal of the status quo effect in some settings.",>Takashi Tsuzuki>Manabu Kikuchi>Itsuki Chiba,>Rikkyo University>Rikkyo University>Rikkyo University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0961/index.html
2013,The effects of self-explanation on science concept learning for sixth grade students: Misconceptions matter,"Self-explanation (SE) is an effective strategy for improving understanding and it relied on learners’ proper deployment of prior knowledge. Surprisingly, there is limited research on how might misconceptions affects learning despite they are inherent part of learners’ knowledge system. We examine the influence of SE on processes and outcomes of science learning for 36 sixth grade students by varying degrees of prior knowledge and relevant misconceptions. The SE group read and self-explained a text describing state changes of water requiring proper notions of molecules while the control group read twice and think aloud. The results indicated that there are no effects of SE, prior knowledge for learning outcomes. However there is significant effect of SE by misconception interaction. Low misconception students benefit from SE but not for high misconception counterparts. SE did influence amounts and types of verbal protocol students generated.

2013,Do Japanese junior high school pupils really dislike mathematics? -Discrepancies between explicit and implicit assessment measures-,"The purpose of this study is to examine whether Japanese junior high school pupils really dislike mathematics. In addition to questionnaires to inquire explicitly of the likings of school subjects, we administered the FUMIE Tests (Mori et al., 2008) to 512 junior high school pupils to assess the implicit evaluative association to the school subjects. We found a considerable proportion of pupils answered negatively to the target school subjects in the questionnaire while their implicit association scores showed somewhat positive valences. The discrepancies were larger for “mathematics” than “science”. One hundred of 512 pupils answered negatively to mathematics while their implicit measures were positive. In contrast, only five of 102 showed the same discrepancy for science. These results imply that there may exist a tendency to pretend to be a math-dislike in pupils. We discussed this tendency that may eventually lead them to real math-dislikes.",>Akitoshi Uchida>Kazuo Mori,">Togakushi Junior High School>Institute of Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0963/index.html
2013,Are you human? The engagement in real-time social interactions recruits the reward system,"An intrinsic motivation for social interaction has often been proposed and is thought to be unique to the human species. However, little is known about underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether experiencing engagement in social interaction recruits the reward system of the brain. A combined eye-tracking and fMRI paradigm was used in which participants interacted with a virtual agent in a series of gaze-based interactions in real-time. To create situations in which they experience the interaction as social or as non-social, they were made believe that during each block the agent’s gaze behavior could either be controlled by another human participant or a computer algorithm. The other participant was a confederate of the experimenter, which enabled experimental control of the agent's gaze reactions. After each block participants had to indicate whether they experienced the interaction as social or not. Results demonstrated that gaze-based interactions with a perceived human partner is associated with activity in the ventral striatum, a core component of reward-related neurocircuitry, while interactions with a computer-driven agent activate attention networks. In addition, the nature of the interaction with a human partner (naive vs. cooperative) differentially modulates striatal activity.",>Ulrich Pfeiffer>Leonhard Schilbach>Bert Timmermans>Bojana Kuzmanovic>Alexandra Georgescu>Gary Bente>Kai Vogeley,">University Hospital Cologne, Department of Psychiatry, Cologne, Germany>University Hospital Cologne, Department of Psychiatry, Cologne, Germany>University of Aberdeen, School of Psychology, Aberdeen, UK>Research Center Jülich, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-8), Ethics in the Neurosciences>University Hospital Cologne, Department of Psychiatry, Cologne, Germany>University of Cologne, Department of Psychology, Institute for Social and Media Psychology>University Hospital Cologne, Department of Psychiatry, Cologne, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0964/index.html

Quantitative analyses of eye-gazes during utterances showed that the speakers with lower linguistic expertise were observed more by the listeners in the second language conversations, whereas, the listeners' expertise level did not affect the amount of their gazes to the speakers. The analyses of a questionnaire suggested that the participants with lower expertise were not conscious of their own gazing activities; they self-evaluated the amount of their gazes to the speakers' eyes much lower in conversations in their second language than those in their native language. The participants with lower expertise evaluated the pressure they felt higher than those with higher expertise.

2013,Effects of Cultural Knowledge on Parallel Language Activation in German-English Bilinguals,"Bilinguals have been shown to activate their two languages simultaneously during spoken word recognition (e.g., Blumenfeld & Marian, 2007). We investigated whether top-down conceptual processing influences parallel language activation using the visual world eye-tracking paradigm. Cultural knowledge was used to manipulate semantic activation in L1 during L2 word processing. Critical trials contained target items that were culturally meaningful to individuals who grew up in Germany, alongside German competitor items that had word-initial phonological overlap with the target word. We hypothesized that German-English bilinguals would fixate the German competitor items more in the culturally salient condition than in the culturally neutral condition. Preliminary data from seven German-English bilinguals and 10 English monolinguals revealed a competitor effect in the culturally salient condition only for bilinguals (p=.03), with no effect in the culturally-neural condition (p>.1). Results suggest that activation of cultural knowledge in bilinguals exerts a conceptual top-down influence on parallel language activation.",>Sebnem Uzuner>Henrike Blumenfeld>Marcel Giezen,>San Diego State University>San Diego State University>San Diego State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0966/index.html

We investigate if this testing-effect can be applied to word learning during reading by manipulating the sentence context in which words are presented. In a within-subject experiment, adult learners without prior knowledge of Swahili studied 80 Swahili words and then repeatedly read the words either in an L1-context that was uninformative and required the retrieval of word meanings from memory to be understood (e.g., “I use the =funguo=”) or in a rich context that enabled the readers to derive word meanings (e.g., “I use the =funguo= to unlock the door”). Recall-accuracy and speed for the newly learned words were measured during reading as well as immediately and seven days after practice to evaluate effects of sentence context and retrieval success during reading on the retention of word form and meaning.",>Gesa S.

2013,When do PDP neural networks learn localist representations?,"One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) approach to cognitive modeling is that representations are distributed across a large set of units. However, this is not always the case. In a series of simulations we show that PDP neural networks tend to form localist representations under certain conditions. First, localist representations are developed when the mapping between the input and output patterns is arbitrary. A second pressure to learn localist codes comes from having to keep multiple representations active at the same time. Introducing biologically plausible constraints on the network architecture also fosters developing local codes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the widespread assumption that PDP neural networks learn distributed representations is often wrong. Moreover, exploring the computational reasons for which PDP learn localist representations provides insight into why selective neurons are often found in the brain.",>Ivan Vankov>Jeffrey Bowers,>University of Bristol>University of Bristol,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0968/index.html

We develop a graph theoretical methodology inspired in this concept to study behavioral data. Having a similarity measure appropriate to the data, we propose to build a graph connecting each agent its nearest n neighbors, having that their similarity exceeds a threshold p. From here, graph theoretical indicators such as connectivity and clustering can be studied as functions of p and n. We apply this methodology to a psychological experiment where 97 participants estimate the typicality of 8 objects with respect to the concept “Hat”, in 2 contexts. Using correlation distance as a similarity function, we compute clustering properties, and average path length as functions of n and p. Interestingly, only n=20 connections are required to keep the similarity structure of the system, having an average path length near 2.",>Tomas Veloz,>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0970/index.html

For animals it appears to be beneficial (for survival) to synchronize their behavior, but what are the benefits for humans to do so? There are indications that interpersonal synchrony supports social bonding. Previous studies have shown that interpersonal synchrony can have both an effect on (e.g., increases memory), and can be affected by social factors (e.g., higher likeability ratings, more interpersonal synchrony). The goal of the present study was to examine whether social factors (e.g., popularity, friendship) affect interpersonal synchrony when working together.

Previous research has repeatedly observed that inferring gravity – a top-down process – modulates spatial memory. The present study found that differences in the eye gaze orientation of the man by a cliff such as facing up or facing down, and linguistic information such as ‘Jumped’ or ‘Fell’, independently influence the spatial memory of the man’s location.

The current study addressed how the eye gaze direction of a highly simplified face influences decisions made regarding questions with no obvious answer.

2013,Visitors from outer space: On picking up relevance in inductive reasoning,"In the last decade, numerous studies in inductive reasoning have shown that people are remarkably quick at picking up the relevant features that allow generalizations. One formal account of (some instances of) cases where this ability emerges, relies on the assumptions people make about the manner in which the observations are sampled from the world. According to a weak sampling scheme, observations are randomly drawn from the environment. However, a reasoner can also assume that the observations are sampled deliberately from the intended hypothesis (strong sampling). In the present contribution, we compare these assumptions in a inductive reasoning task using semantic stimuli from 4 superordinate concepts (animals, clothes, vehicles,musical instruments). Model analyses are performed to examine the sampling assumptions of reasoners in this context. We find that people generally assume a strong sampling scheme.

2013,New methods for assessing ontological and representational changes in the conceptual system of children and adults,"Cognitive developmental research has documented that children acquire rich knowledge about the physical and psychological world before they are exposed to science, and that learning science requires substantial ontological, epistemological and representational changes to happen in the conceptual system of the child. For example, Vosniadou & Skopeliti (2005) showed that while the majority of third grade children categorized the earth as a physical object distinct from solar objects like the sun and the moon, 90% percent of 5th graders categorized the earth as an astronomical object, belonging to the same category as the sun and the moon. In the present research we will present two novel, chronometric, tasks for assessing the conceptual re-organizations that take place as children are exposed to systematic science instruction and for further exploring the question of whether naive theories are overwritten or survive and continue to exist together with the scientific theories.

2013,Feeling Guilt vs. Regret about Own Decisions: What are the Psychological and Neurobiological Differences?,"Humans use counterfactual thinking in order to evaluate their previous choices, comparing the actual outcome of a choice with what would have happened if they had chosen another action option. Two prototypical emotions resulting from such counterfactual evaluations are guilt and regret, both of which play an important role in regulating human choice behavior. Guilt is thought to refer specifically to social choices, while regret occurs for both individual and social choices. Here, we introduce an fMRI compatible new experimental paradigm to differentially induce guilt and regret under controlled conditions as a result of real decision. Behavioral data confirm that guilt but not regret specifically occurs in a social context (i.e. after harm for another person caused by own choices). On the neural level, initial results point to a critical involvement of different sub-regions within the prefrontal cortex in the processing of guilt vs. regret.",>Ullrich Wagner>Lisa Handke>Henrik Walter,">Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Division of Mind and Brain Research, Charitéplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany>Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Division of Mind and Brain Research, Charitéplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany>Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Division of Mind and Brain Research, Charitéplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0977/index.html
2013,Word Segmentation Without Statistics,"A critical step in language acquisition is segmenting speech into words. Prior cross-linguistic research demonstrates the importance of language specific segmentation strategies (Gervain & Erra, 2012). English-learning infants can use statistical information to segment words in laboratory experiments (Saffran et al., 1996), but its informativeness in segmenting English is unclear (Yang & Gambell, 2004; Swingley, 2005). We analyzed one corpus of 611,837 child-directed utterances (Theakston et al, 2000; MacWhinney, 2000), and one corpus of 50,776 adult-directed utterances (Pitt et al., 2007) and found that, in both corpora, a simple strategy that assumes that each syllable is a word would be highly effective in segmenting words. Accuracy was 69.68% and 61.7% in the child and adult corpora, respectively, segmenting 87.44% and 87.90% of the corpora. These findings should guide further investigations into the processes infants actually use to segment speech, and more broadly how they learn appropriate language-specific word segmentation strategies.",>Felix Wang>Toben Mintz,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0978/index.html

We hypothesize that implicit word segmentation by Chinese readers is developed via the statistical learning mechanism that is universal. Twenty non-Chinese speakers were exposed to a sequence of 3600 characters constructed from six disyllabic words with 6 different characters. The transitional probabilities between any two characters were .46 to 1 within words, and 0 to .29 between words. The sequence was presented one character every half a second. Occasionally, the presentation rate doubled. The participants’ task was to detect the instances of double presentation. Upon completing the task, a surprise test followed that consisted of a word and a nonword (reversals of the characters in a word) from the sequence. The participants had to decide which one had appeared before. The averaged accuracy rate was greater than chance (.53).

2013,Closer than you think?: Options for efficiently approximating optimal analogies under Structure Mapping Theory,"Structure Mapping Theory (SMT) is an important and influential theory in cognitive science. One unresolved issue is this theory's intractability. It is known that finding optimally systematic analogies under SMT is NP-hard, making it unrealistic that human analogizing is characterized by optimality. Yet, experimental studies suggest that the optimality assumption gives the best fit to human performance data. A solution to this paradox may be that SMT can be efficiently approximated to such a degree that, for practical intents and purposes, human analogies appear to be optimal. However, outside of a limited empirical evaluation of the commonly-used greedy SME heuristic given in Forbus and Oblinger (1990), no analyses of the approximability of SMT have been done to date. We fill this void by providing both the first theoretical analyses of the types of efficient approximability available for SMT and the first systematic empirical evaluation of the greedy SME heuristic.",>Todd Wareham>Tijl Grootswagers>Iris van Rooij,">Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada>Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0980/index.html
2013,Robust social learning to babble in a spiking neural network model,"Three humans interacted with a spiking neural network model that controls the lip and jaw muscles of a speech synthesizer. The model learns using spike-timing dependent plasticity that is greater when reinforcement is received. First the humans each selectively reinforced the model, encouraging it to more frequently produce vocalizations with speech-like syllabic elements. Afterwards, for each human-reinforced simulation a yoked control simulation was generated. All the sounds produced during the course of learning for all human-reinforced and all yoked control simulations were then judged on a four-point syllable quality scale by all three listeners (sounds were presented in random order). In all cases, these judgments indicated that the human-reinforced models produced more sophisticated babbling over the course of learning whereas the yoked control simulations did not. The results support this model of how canonical babbling, a major developmental milestone, may develop.",>Anne S. Warlaumont>Sophia R.

2013,Emotion and Decision-Making: Modeling Strategy Selection,"Models of decision making neglect the impact of emotions on information processing. Here we present a model of decision strategy selection that can account for the differences in the use of two strategies, the take-the-best heuristic (TTB) and the Weighted Additive rule (WADD) in a probabilistic inference task. How can such a model incorporate emotions? Our model assumes attentional weighting of cues, controlled by the activity of locus coeruleus – a brainstem nucleus associated with physiological arousal. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, the model was evaluated on data from a study where participants performed a probabilistic inference task and emotional stress was manipulated with highly aversive slides. For each participant we estimated the parameter that controls cue weighting. This parameter correlated positively with the proportion of choices consistent with TTB and negatively with the proportion of choices consistent with WADD. Moreover, this parameter was sensitive to the emotional stress manipulation.",>Szymon Wichary>Tomasz Smolen,">Interdisciplinary Center for Applied Cognitive Studies, Warsaw University of Social Sciences and Humanities>Department of Psychology, Krakow Pedagogical University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0982/index.html
2013,Television network attitudes toward political candidates implicit in lexical statistics,"Languages exhibit statistical regularities concerning the frequencies and co-occurrences of words. Language users learn from such patterns without being consciously aware of them. We investigated statistical properties of the language used on television news in discussing politicians. We compiled corpora consisting of language used on four networks (MSNBC, ABCNews, CNN, FOXNews) from 2007-2012. We analyzed the frequencies with which 500 affectively-valenced words co-occurred with politicians' names (Obama, McCain, Romney) during the run-ups to the 2008 and 2012 elections. We used these co-occurrences to derive a summary measure, their net positivity score. Positivity scores for candidates changed over time in ways that reflect real-world events. Positivity towards candidates differed across networks. Net positivity toward President Obama during his first term was strongly correlated with approval ratings. The results show that statistical aspects of language, of which people are not consciously aware, convey varying attitudes on network news.",>Jon Willits>Mark Seidenberg,>Indiana University>University of Wisconsin Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0983/index.html
2013,The effect of accent on the perception of American and British English fluent speech in Chinese second language learners,"Spoken words are phonologically reduced through various processes (e.g., assimilation) in fluent speech. The reduced forms of words give rise to perceptual difficulties for nonnative speakers. This study examined whether accent types (General American and Received Pronunciation (PR) British Englishes) of native English fluent speech affect fluent speech perception in Chinese speakers. A representative sample of sixty undergraduate students were tested with listening comprehension tests (recordings produced by American and British English speakers), reduced forms dictation test (with American- and British-accented speech as stimuli) and fluent speech production task. Based on correlational analyses, it is shown that listening comprehension was significantly correlated with both fluent speech perception and production skills among the Chinese speakers. Importantly, these correlations were observed within the same accent type and across the two accents. However, our regression analyses showed that speech perception rather than production significantly predicted the outcome of listening comprehension.",>Simpson WL Wong>Peggy Mok>Vina W.H.

2013,The deficits of visual encoding processes in Chinese Dyslexics,"The present research aimed at identifying cognitive processing that works at the initial stage of letter identification. First, we used the word superiority effect task to set the baseline of visual detection rate and then we used the letter matching task to evaluate the phonemic transference rate of the particpants. It was hypothesized that physically-different letters required longer processing time as the judgment depended not only on visual detection, but also on a process of phonemic transference. Our results found that the control group had a higher letter identification rate than the dyslexic group, showing that visual detection rate was a good predictor of reading disability. However, phonemic transference rate was not a good predictor of dyslexia. One of the reasons may be that the process of letter identification involved cognitive skills other than that of phonemic transference alone.",>Orieta H. Y. Wong>Michael C. W.

2013,Inflection from form versus meaning: Developmental and computational evidence,"Inflectional morphology has proven a test case for evaluating theoretical approaches to language processing. The bulk of empirical data has been acquired using the inflection from stem task, which approximates more naturalistic speech production only if mandatory stem retrieval is assumed. Yet work with adults reveals quite different results when inflection proceeds instead from meaning. Connectionist computational models of inflection have simulated these task differences, but the extent to which they accurately reflect development remains unknown. For the first time, we consider the impact of task type upon inflectional development of 908 children aged between 2 and 4 years. We then present a revised version of a connectionist model of inflection, which has been trained in a manner consistent with child directed speech in order to capture the children’s performance. Taken together, this work demonstrates the progression of the field to more ecologically and developmentally valid approaches to inflection.",>Anna Woollams>Joanna Moy>Sarah Keeble>Grzegorz Krajewski>Anna Theakston,">School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester>School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester>School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester>Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw>School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0986/index.html
2013,Mnemonic convergence in a social network:,"Selective rehearsal of memories through conversation shapes subsequent recall for both speakers and listeners. Interactional memory acts have typically been studied in dyadic conversation or small groups; however, as Christakis and Fowler (2009) point out, humans don’t just belong to groups, we are more precisely enmeshed in social networks. This study extends Coman and Hirst’s (2012) work on propagation of socially-shared retrieval-induced forgetting (Cuc, Koppel, and Hirst, 2007) and social contagion (Roediger, Meade, & Bergman, 2001) across a series of conversations. We move from dyadic networks to a dynamically self-assembling social network of 46 undergraduates over a nine-week period. Using a framework derived from Kauffman’s (1994) models of adaptive fitness landscapes in evolution, we trace mnemonic convergence as it emerges from the interplay of “internal” cognitive factors and dynamics attributable to network connectivity.

2013,How to rectify the confirmation bias in Wason(1960)'s 2-4-6 task,"People have a strong confirmatory bias, which is remarkably difficult to overcome. In this research, we investigated how we could help people rectify the confirmatory bias, using Wason(1960)’s 2-4-6 task. 195 University and middle school students participated in our study, in which they were to find out the rule “increasing 3 numbers,” starting from the 2-4-6 number sequence. Prior to the task, the participants were assigned to one of the four training conditions: (1)“Counter-Examples”, in which participants were instructed to create the positive and counter-examples for the current hypothesis; (2) “Two-Hypotheses”, in which participants were instructed to create examples for two different hypotheses; (3) “Counter-Examples-AND-Two-Hypotheses; (4) Control, in which participants were told to think about examples consistent with their hypothesis. We found that the training to think counter-examples facilitates attempts to falsify the current hypothesis and subsequent hypothesis change, but creating examples for two different hypothesis did not.",>Tomohito Yamazaki>Mutsumi Imai,>Keio University>Keio University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0988/index.html
2013,Computational modeling of inference generation during reading comprehension,"This research presents a computational model that simulates inference generation during reading comprehension. Inferences refer to information that readers generate from their background knowledge in order to clarify, connect, and elaborate textual information. The computational model integrates Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which simulates general knowledge by computing the strength of semantic association between concepts (Landauer & Dumais, 1997), with the Landscape Model, a dynamic model of reading comprehension that simulates fluctuations of concepts' activation and the emergence of episodic connections between them (Yeari and van den Broek, 2011). The extended model was used to simulate behavioral data from a large number of studies on inference generation. Successful simulations of the various findings demonstrate the unique roles of semantic associations, episodic inter-textual relations, and working memory (limitation of concepts' activation sum) in the activation of different types of inferences (i.e., elaborative and bridging inferences).",>Meni Yeari>Paul van den Broek,">Bar-Ilan Univeristy, Ramat-Gan, Israel>Leiden University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0989/index.html
2013,Argument order as an expectation trigger in Korean,"Expected words/constituents are often processed faster than unexpected words/constituents. In languages like English that verbs are placed before arguments that they encode, the occurrence of verbs pre-activates upcoming arguments, suggesting that verbs’ arguments are expected upon the recognition of verbs. However, this is not the case for languages like Korean that verbs are placed after the arguments associated with verbs. This study investigated whether argument order might play a role in cuing upcoming arguments. Using Hong et al.’s materials, we conducted a completion study. We found that patients were expected when recipients were introduced before, whereas recipients were not expected when patients were introduced before, suggesting that comprehenders might expect encountering patients after recipients but not vice versa. The probability of patients/recipients was correlated with the frequency of regressions that Hong et al. observed. We will further examine the role of probability and uncertainty in processing in terms of expectation.",>Hongoak Yun>Uphong Hong>Yun-Ju Nam>Hyunjung Kim,>Konkuk University>Konkuk University>Konkuk University>Konkuk University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0990/index.html
2013,Social interaction and cognition: from L. Vygotsky and M. Bakhtin tradition to computer agents’ interactivity,"Social-interactive cognition in Russia builds on the ideas of cultural-historical psychology by L. Vygotsky, A. Leontyev, A. Luria, as well as communicative aspect of cognition introduced by M. Bakhtin in his theory of dialogism which, in its turn, laid the ground for the studies of social and situated cognition. Since 1980-s cognitive-discursive paradigm in Russia, introduced by E. Kubryakova, has attracted attention of cognitive science scholars. Within this paradigm cognitive approaches to pragmatics of communication and agentivity have been developed (V.Zabotkina, E. Pozdnyakova). The given study introduces further development of the field, based on a multi-modal corpus built with recorded live communication data. Presently it’s the biggest multi-modal corpus of emotional communication, so it ensures completeness and accuracy of research, conducted on its basis. Two- and three-dimensional computer agents (A. Kotov) operate a set of speech patterns in a complex of restricted communication situations, simulating real-life emotional social interaction.",>Vera Zabotkina>Elena Pozdnyakova>Artemy Kotov,">Russian State University for the Humanities>Russian State University for the Humanities>Russian Research Centre ""Kurchatov Institute""",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0991/index.html
2013,Metacognitive Judgments in Category Learning,"The aim of the study was to investigate confidence in classification accuracy during category learning with three levels of categorization difficulty based on a simple logical, conjunctive or complex rule. Twenty five psychology students participated in the study. Stimuli were geometrical figures that varied on three dimensions: shape, colour, and size. We analysed differences in absolute accuracy of confidence judgments with respect to task difficulty (three levels), learning phase (early, late) and performance groups (slow and fast learners). For the simple logical task, we obtained a significant main effect of phase and a significant interaction between phase and group, suggesting that fast learners achieved higher accuracy earlier. For the conjunctive task, the significant main effect of the group showed higher accuracy of fast learners. For the complex task, there was a significant interaction between phase and group showing that judgment accuracy in slow learners did not improve during learning.",>Valnea Zauhar>Igor Bajšanski>Drazen Domijan,>University of Rijeka>University of Rijeka>University of Rijeka,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0992/index.html
2013,Effects of Strategy and Rule Complexity on Multivariable Inductive Judgments,"We investigated the effects of strategy use and rule complexity on multivariable inductive judgments. Participants (N=274) made judgments about which of two cars presented on a computer screen was faster. Participants were randomly assigned to a complex rule or a simple rule. For the complex rule, three of five variables affected speed; for the simple rule one variable affected speed. Participants were instructed to make explicit (try to discover the rules governing speed) or implicit (speeded intuitive) judgments for 300 trials with feedback. A 2 (complexity) x 2 (strategy instruction) ANOVA revealed main effects of complexity, F(1,270)=6.17, p=.014, and task instruction, F(1,270)=11.69, p=.001, and a significant interaction, F(1,270)=7.38, p=.007. The explicit strategy led to better performance for the simple rule only, but no differences were found for the implicit strategy. These findings run counter to recent work showing an advantage for implicit processing of complex rules (Zimmerman & Pretz, 2012).",>Corinne Zimmerman>Steve Croker,>Illinois State University>Illinois State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0993/index.html
2013,"Difference in Single vs. Pair judgements on Deception Detection, Confidence and Bias based on the Level of Communication","When people judge whether others are telling the truth, they act differently if they are working alone or in a group. The current experiment explored this finding. Participants (working alone or in pairs) provided either a binary truth/lie decision, or a binary decision and a set of reasons chosen from a list, or an open ended discussion/explanation. Being alone or in a pair had no significant effect on accuracy, but confidence was higher in pairs. A truth bias was found in the single condition but was eliminated for pairs when they specified a reason or had a discussion. Accuracy was highest when stating a reason chosen from a list, while confidence increased with the amount of information provided. These findings improve our understanding of the effect of pair decision making, illustrating how varying levels of information can have different effect on decision making and deception detection.",>Mircea Zloteanu>Daniel Richardson,">University College London, London, United Kingdom>University College London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0994/index.html
2013,Progressive Development of the Number Sense in a Deep Neural Network,"What are the developmental bases of the number sense? This ability could arise through evolution or experience. Stoianov & Zorzi (2012, Nature Neuroscience, 8, 194-196) showed that a neural network could learn number sense from visual examples containing varying numbers of elements. However, the layer-wise training regime is unrealistic from a developmental standpoint. A key observation is that number acuity progressively develops from infancy to adulthood (as reflected by a decreasing Weber fraction). This development involves accumulation of single examples, each of which updates the connection weights in a hierarchical system. We present an unsupervised deep network that learns all weights as it observes one `number example’ at a time. As on-line training progresses, neurons representing numerosity start to emerge in the deeper layers, and the Weber fraction progressively sharpens. These results establish that a generic learning algorithm in a deep network gives rise to a clear developmental trajectory of the number sense.",>Will Y. Zou>James L.

2013,On the different types of information stored in the lexicon and their neural bases,We explore the idea that the neuropsychological organization of memory explains contradictory results about the lexicon. We believe that a semantic component stores the prototypic information and an ‘episodic’ component stores both the exceptions to the prototypes and the exceptionally common stimuli. With this theoretical insight we studied the different types of information that are accessed when a word is presented to a subject. To this end we first reproduced some results from Hare and coworkers showing that the presentation of a word for a noun facilitates the recognition of words related to the context of the word usage more than what could count as a semantic definition. The same pattern is observed for the neurophysiologically determined facilitation of the N400 component. Some of the results can be explained by corpus linguistic tools such as LSA. We present evidence from bimodal priming experiments supporting part of our theoretical proposition.,>Camila Zugarramurdi>Álvaro Cabana>Juan Valle-Lisboa,">Facultad de Psicología, Universidad de la República, Uruguay.>Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la República, Uruguay.>Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la República, Uruguay.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0996/index.html

2016,"Active learning: Cognitive development, education, and computational models","In this workshop, we invite speakers from a variety of approaches to broadly inform our understanding of active learning, including cognitive development, education, and computational modeling. We examine what “active” means in active learning, and present talks on the cognitive mechanisms that might support active learning, including attention, hypothesis-generation, explanation, pretend play, and question asking. We also explore how efficient learners are when planning and executing actions in the service of learning, and whether there are developmental or socioeconomic differences in active learning. We integrate the problem of active learning with teaching to investigate the similarities and differences involved in selecting evidence for oneself and others. Throughout we ask how we can capture these processes with computational models that spell out the underlying assumptions and potential algorithms.",>Elizabeth Bonawitz>Fei Xu,">Rutgers University - Newark>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0001/index.html
2016,Learning to Talk about Events: Grounding Language Acquisition in Intuitive Theories and Event Cognition,"Language is a powerful tool for moving thoughts from the mind of one person to another. Thus, any theory of language must make contact with theories of thought and conceptual representation. Any theory of language acquisition must explain how children link words to concepts, whether those concepts were pre-existing or created during the process of language acquisition. Conversely, theories of conceptual representation are constrained by the need to support language and language acquisition. Indeed, there is a rich tradition of cognitive science research that explicitly tackles these issues.",>Eva Wittenberg>Melissa Kline>Joshua Hartshorne,>UC San Diego>Harvard University>Boston College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0002/index.html
2016,Proposal of the Second Workshop on Physical and Social Scene Understanding,"Computer vision has made significant progress in locating and recognizing objects in real images. However, beyond the scope of this “what is where” challenge, it lacks the abilities to understand scenes characterizing human visual experience. The mission of this workshop is to (a) identify the key domains in which human visual perception and cognition outperform computer vision; (b) formalize the computational challenges in these domains; and (c) provide promising frameworks for solving these challenges by conducting cognitive science and computer vision studies.",>Tao Gao>Chenfanfu Jiang>Yixin Zhu>Yibiao Zhao>Lap-Fai (craig) Yu,">MIT>University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States>UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, United States>MIT>University of Massachusetts Boston",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0003/index.html
2016,Tutorial Workshop on Contemporary Deep Neural Network Models,"Neural network models were exploited in the late 80’s and 90’s to model human cognition, based on developments such as the back propagation learning algorithm. Over the last 10 years, massive data sets, enhanced computational resources, and new developments in algorithms have led to explosive growth in use of such models in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We propose a workshop to bring the tools, methods, and insights from this research into contemporary cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience.",>James L. McClelland>Steven S.

2016,"Workshop on Corpus Collection, (Semi)-Automated Analysis, and Modeling of Large-Scale Naturalistic Language Acquisition Data","The main goal of this full-day workshop is to bring together researchers from several distinct fields: behavioral psychologists studying language acquisition, speech technology researchers, linguists, and computational modelers of cognitive development. These groups are broadly interested in the same questions, i.e. what is the nature of speech and language, and how might a system learn to process it in supervised or unsupervised ways? Since the groups interested in these questions work on different analysis levels, cross-pollination has been sparse.",>Elika Bergelson,>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0005/index.html
2016,"Interactive spatiotemporal cognition: Data, theories, architectures, and autonomy","Everyday interactions often depend on reasoning about space and time: collaborators need to know where events take place – and in what order – to, e.g., communicate driving directions, build pieces of furniture, or carry out strategic operations in military and sports settings (Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013). A simple set of driving directions may require a listener to interpret and reason about the spatial relations – such as next to and behind – and the temporal relations – such as after and during – that a speaker describes. The speaker may also use gestures to substitute, supplement, or disambiguate linguistic descriptions (Holle & Gunter, 2007; Perzanowski, Schultz, & Williams, 1998). Such rapid, rich, and productive interactions are transient and difficult to analyze behaviorally, and so they pose a challenge for experimenters.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Greg Trafton,">Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA>Naval Research Laboratory",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0006/index.html
2016,Full Day Tutorial on Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision,"This tutorial is an exposition of a rapidly growing new alternative approach to building computational models of cognition based on quantum theory. The cognitive revolution that occurred in the 1960’s was based on classical computational logic, and the connectionist/neural network movements of the 1970’s were based on classical dynamical systems. These classical assumptions remain at the heart of both cognitive architecture and neural network theories, and they are so commonly and widely applied that we take them for granted. Quantum theory provides a different approach to logic, reasoning, probabilistic inference, and dynamical systems. For example, quantum logic does not follow the distributive axiom of Boolean logic; quantum probabilities do not obey the disjunctive axiom of Kolmogorov probability; quantum reasoning does not obey the principle of monotonic reasoning. It turns out that humans do not obey these restrictions either, which is why we consider a quantum approach.",>Jennifer Trueblood>James Yearsley>Peter Kvam>Zheng Wang>Jerome Busemeyer,">Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA>Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, U.S.>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0007/index.html
2016,Wallace: Automating Cultural Evolution Experiments Through Crowdsourcing,"The experimental study of cultural evolution, social learning, cooperation, and collective decision-making asks fundamental questions about our capacities to learn, decide, and communicate in a world that is shared with other people. Experimental studies of cultural evolution have revealed a wealth of findings, including how structured forms of communication emerge from individual learning and decision-making (Verhoef, Kirby, & Padden, 2011; Claidière, Smith, Kirby, & Fagot, 2014), the inductive biases underlying human decision making (Griffiths et al., 2008), how innovations accumulate in populations to produce technologies that go beyond what any one individual could create (Caldwell, & Millen, 2008; Derex & Boyd, 2015), and how the mode of communication affects transmission and acquisition of new skills (Morgan et al., 2015).",>Jordan W.

2016,Analysing discourse relations in natural language: The case of space and time,"Discourse relations are links between utterances and sentences or sentence parts. These can be implicit or explicit through markers such as because, before, but, etc. Thus, the causal discourse relation between the two clauses that is explicit in 'He fell because he stumbled over a stone' can be inferred in the sentence 'He stumbled over a stone and fell'. Much research in this field focuses on the range of ways in which these connections can be established and inferred by the recipient (or analyst). However, the use of such markers in discourse also shows how a speaker conceptualizes the relationships between various aspects of what they are saying. Whenever they occur in discourse, they are therefore reflections of the speakers' mind in this respect.",>Thora Tenbrink,">Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0009/index.html
2016,Cognitive models of transfer of cognitive skills,"If you learn mathematics in school, but then proceed to become a lawyer, will you have any benefit from mathematics, for example in terms of abstract reasoning? Very little is know about the cognitive mechanisms behind such transfer of knowledge, and most psychological theories assume that very little transfer exists (Singley & Anderson, 1989, Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901). Nevertheless it is undisputable that many of our cognitive skills build upon each other, and have benefits beyond just the skill itself. Moreover, the new controversial industry of Brain Training games has emerged where spectacular improvements on various cognitive measures is promised, even though empirical evidence for such improvements is rather weak (Chein & Morrison, 2010, Jaeggi et al, 2008, Karbach & Kray, 2009, Owen et al., 2010).",>Niels Taatgen,>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0010/index.html
2016,Tutorial: Meta-Analytic Methods for Cognitive Science,"Meta-analysis is a powerful yet underused tool in cognitive science. It allows researchers to leverage entire bodies of literature to get a broad and quantitative overview of a particular phenomenon, thereby promoting theory development, and to make more precise estimates of effect sizes, which enables robust planning of prospective studies (e.g. through power-analyses). In this tutorial, we will introduce meta-analysis as a tool with which to inform everyday research, and provide participants with hands-on experience conducting their own meta-analysis. We will also present an online platform we have developed for conducting meta-analyses in the field of language development: MetaLab (http://metalab.stanford.edu).",>Sho Tsuji>Molly Lewis>Christina Bergmann>Mike Frank>Alejandrina Cristia,">Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France>Stanford University, Stanford , California, USA>Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France>Stanford University,  Stanford , California, USA>Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0011/index.html
2016,Empirical and Computational Approaches to Metaphor and Figurative Meaning,"One of the hallmarks of human intelligence is the ability to go beyond literal meanings of utterances to infer speakers' intended meanings, a feat that remains elusive to the most advanced artificial systems. Figurative language such as metaphor, in particular, provides a striking case where complex meanings arise that cannot be derived from the literal semantics alone. For example, ""My lawyer is a shark"" is a literally false sentence, yet communicates relevant features of the lawyer in question (e.g. ""ruthless,"" but not ""swims"").",>Justine Kao>Noah Goodman,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0012/index.html

2016,Effecting re-representation: revising false beliefs and fostering creativity,"Perhaps the greatest challenge to successful learning and problem solving is when learners initially represent the novel problem or concept in a way that conflicts with the proper solution or content to be learned. For example, naïve conceptions of force often lead to failure to show any learning gains from lessons on Newton’s laws of motion (e.g., Muller, Sharma, & Reiman, 2008), and knowledge of typical functions prevent using familiar artefacts in novel ways to solve otherwise simple problems (Adamson, 1952). Further, rampant society-wide misconceptions, such as the belief that vaccines cause autism, or deny the causal role of humans in global warming, are having disastrous effects on public health and environmental policy. On the flip side, overcoming the constraints of an initial representation can spark creative innovation. For example, the Dyson vacuum cleaner is famously based on the re-conception of the vacuum mechanism via an analogy to saw mills.",>Micah Goldwater>Zachary Horne>Jeffrey Loewenstein>Robert Goldstone,">University of Sydney, NSW Australia>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States of America>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States of America>Indiana University, Bloomington IA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0014/index.html
2016,The Emergence of Conventions,"Much of our everyday behavior is governed by conventions. The shape of the line we form at the cafe, the language we use to order our coffee, and the money we use to pay for it are all partly arbitrary but self-sustaining solutions to recurring coordination problems. This definition, first formalized by David Lewis (1969), has provided a potent means of characterizing conventions. For cognitive scientists, however, the outstanding question is how these solutions emerge and adapt in populations of learning, reasoning agents.

2016,The cultural evolution of cognition,"As humans, we share most of our biological make-up with our closest primate relatives, yet we stand out not just from them but from all other species with respect to our cultural diversity, our capacity for language, and particularly our cognitive skills. While of prime interest for the field of cognitive science, the still-open question of which factors gave rise to human uniqueness has rarely surfaced at its conferences or in its journals. A hallmark of humankind, our propensity for engaging in social interactions and cultural transmission, is likely one of the most essential pre-conditions of cognitive evolution, accompanied by both language (Christiansen & Kirby, 2003) and material culture (Malafouris, 2013). Accounting for evolutionary change in human cognition thus requires new conceptual frameworks that view our psychological, behavioral, and material capabilities as interacting in complex manners in a continuous process of co-evolution (Richerson & Christiansen, 2013).",>Sieghard Beller>Andrea Bender>Christine Caldwell>Morten Christiansen>Karenleigh Overmann>Kenny Smith,">University of Bergen, Norway>University of Bergen, Norway>University of Stirling, UK>Cornell University, US>University of Oxford, United Kingdom>University of Edinburgh, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0016/index.html

2016,Beyond the language explosion: What gradual word learning tells us about conceptual development,"For the past 50 years, language acquisition researchers have explored the fascinating question of “the language explosion”: how children are able to rapidly acquire hundreds to thousands of new words in a brief period of time. Focusing primarily on how basic-level nouns, such as “cup,” are quickly mapped to visible objects, researchers have proposed several constraints guiding early word learning. Their insights include the principle of mutual exclusivity, the whole object bias, the principle of contrast, fast mapping, and the notion of “comprehension before production.” In striking contrast, we here explore the claim that in some cases, despite early production, children require additional months or even years to achieve adult-like comprehension. This symposium brings together researchers studying five conceptual domains in which children’s word meanings evolve gradually, to explore the inferential processes children use to overcome their early assumptions and acquire adult meanings.",>Katharine Tillman>Katie Wagner>Junyi Chu>Mutsumi Imai>Barbara Malt>Sherri Widen>Marilyn Shatz,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>Kaio University, Japan>Lehigh University>Stanford University>University of Michigan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0019/index.html

2016,Higher-Level Goals in the Processing of Human Action Events,"The concept of a goal critically separates dynamic events involving humans from other events. Human behaviours are motivated by goals, which are known to the actor but typically inferred on the part of the observer. Goals can be hierarchical in nature, such that a collection of sub-goals (e.g., getting a mug, boiling water) can be nested under a higher-level goal (e.g., making tea), which can be further nested under an even higher-level goal (e.g., making breakfast).

2016,Investigating the Effects of Transparency and Ambiguity on Idiom Learning,"The purpose of this study was to learn how transparency and ambiguity affect idiom learning. To start, 157 French idioms were translated to English and normed for familiarity, transparency, and ambiguity. Experiment 1 was a training study in which 32 of these idioms were taught to 25 native English speakers over two days of training. A cued recall test during a third session showed a reliable effect of transparency, but performance was close to ceiling. In Experiment 2, the amount of training was reduced to one session and a semantic relatedness test was included after the cued recall test. The results of Experiment 2 suggest that high transparency idioms are recalled with greater accuracy in a cued-recall test but low transparency idioms are recalled with greater accuracy in a semantic relatedness test. No significant effect of or interaction with ambiguity was found.",>Mehrgol Tiv>Evelyn Milburn>Tessa Warren,">University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0023/index.html

2016,"Modeling category learning using a dual-system approach: A simulation of Shepard, Hovalnd and Jenkins (1961) by COVIS","This paper examines the ability of a dual-system, formal model of categorization COVIS (Ashby, Paul & Maddox, 2011) to predict the learning performance of participants on the six category structures described in Shepard, Hovland and Jenkin’s (1961) seminal study. COVIS assumes that category learning is mediated by two dissociable neural systems that compete to control responding. The verbal system explicitly tests verbalizable rules, whereas the implicit system gradually associates each stimulus with the appropriate response. Although COVIS is highly influential, there are no published evaluations of the formal model against classic category learning data (COVIS is most typically applied heuristically to the design of new experiments). In the current paper, we begin to address this gap in the literature. Specifically, we demonstrate that COVIS is able to accommodate the ordinal pattern found by Shepard et al., provided that adjustments consistent with the model’s theoretical framework are made.",>Charlotte Edmunds>Andy Wills,">Plymouth University, Plymouth, Devon, United Kingdom>Plymouth University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0025/index.html
2016,Using Prior Data to Inform Model Parameters in the Predictive Performance Equation,"The predictive performance equation (PPE) is a mathematical model of learning and retention that attempts to capitalize on the regularities seen in human learning to predict future performance. To generate predictions, PPE’s free parameters must be calibrated to a minimum amount of historical performance data, leaving PPE unable to generate valid predictions for initial learning events. We examined the feasibility of using the data from other individuals, who performed the same task in the past, to inform PPE’s free parameters for new individuals (prior-informed predictions). This approach could enable earlier and more accurate performance predictions. To assess the predictive validity of this methodology, the accuracy of PPE’s individualized and prior-informed predictions before the point in time where PPE can be fully calibrated using an individual’s unique performance history. Our results show that the prior data can be used to inform PPE’s free parameters, allowing earlier performance predictions to be made.",>Michael Collins>Kevin Gluck>Matthew Walsh>Michael Krusmark>Glenn Gunzelmann,>Air Force Research Laboratory>Air Force Research Laboratory>TiER1 Performance Solutions>Air Force Research Laboratory>Air Force Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0026/index.html
2016,Using Statistics to Learn Words and Grammatical Categories: How High Frequency Words Assist Language Acquisition,"Recent studies suggest that high-frequency words may benefit speech segmentation (Bortfeld, Morgan, Golinkoff, & Rathbun, 2005) and grammatical categorisation (Monaghan, Christiansen, & Chater, 2007). To date, these tasks have been examined separately, but not together. We familiarised adults with continuous speech comprising repetitions of target words, and compared learning to a language in which targets appeared alongside high-frequency marker words. Marker words reliably preceded targets, and distinguished them into two otherwise unidentifiable categories. Participants completed a 2AFC segmentation test, and a similarity judgement categorisation test. We tested transfer to a word-picture mapping task, where words from each category were used either consistently or inconsistently to label actions/objects. Participants segmented the speech successfully, but only demonstrated effective categorisation when speech contained high-frequency marker words. The advantage of marker words extended to the early stages of the transfer task. Findings indicate the same high-frequency words may assist speech segmentation and grammatical categorisation.",>Rebecca Frost>Padraic Monaghan>Morten Christiansen,>Lancaster University>Lancaster University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0027/index.html
2016,Modeling Impairments in Lexical Development,"We implemented the connectionist model of social-pragmatic word learning (Caza & Knott, 2012) to test the hypothesis that reduced joint attention between infant and mother would increase the difference in acquisition between nouns and verbs as observed in Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The ratio of objects to actions in the observed event stream was manipulated to create an original noun-verb asymmetry. Ten simulations were run for each of the combinations of three conditions of communicative reliability and two conditions of unfiltered random associative learning, which is regarded by some researchers as the primary mechanism of language learning in ASD. The simulations indicated that the reduction in the reliability of communicative actions does not lead to increased noun-verb asymmetry within the originally planned training epochs. A trend in the predicted direction appeared toward the end of training, suggesting that further simulations may help resolve the issue within the current architecture.",>Michael Vinos>Angeliki Andrikopoulou>Christina F.

2016,Monolinguals’ and Bilinguals’ Use of Language in Forming Novel Object Categories,"Monolinguals and bilinguals differ along a number of dimensions, including the way they label existing object categories (Pavlenko & Malt, 2011). In the present study, we asked whether English monolinguals, Spanish-English bilinguals, and English-Spanish bilinguals also differ in the way they use language when forming novel categories. Previous research with monolinguals shows that a shared label encourages children (e.g., Waxman & Markow, 1995) and adults (e.g., Lupyan, Rakison, & McClelland, 2007) to place objects together. Extending this work, we demonstrate that, when two objects shared a Licit Word label like “zeg,” monolinguals and bilinguals alike were encouraged to group them together. Illicit Words like “gxz,”, on the other hand, only influenced the categorization decisions of bilinguals. Thus bilinguals appear to be more flexible in their use of linguistic information in categorization. Neither group made use of non-linguistic cues (patterned frames), suggesting a unique role for language in category formation.",>Sarah Fairchild>Anna Papafragou,>University of Delaware>University of Delaware,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0029/index.html
2016,Learning How To Throw Darts: The Effect Of Modeling Type And Reflection On Dart-Throwing Skills,"In this study we investigate the effect of modeling type and reflection on the acquisition of dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy beliefs and self-reaction scores by replicating a study by Kitsantas, Zimmerman, and Cleary (2000). Participants observing a coping model were expected to surpass participants observing a mastery model who in turn were expected to outperform participants who learned without a model. Reflection was hypothesized to have a positive effect. Ninety undergraduate students were tested three times on dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy beliefs, and self-reaction scores. Contrary to what was expected, we found no main effects of modeling type and reflection. No interaction effects were found either. There was an effect of trial, indicating that participants improved dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy beliefs, and self-reaction scores over time. Furthermore, self-efficacy beliefs and dart-throwing skill were highly correlated. Our results suggest that learners do not benefit from observing a model and reflecting, but practice makes perfect.",>Janneke van der Loo>Eefje Frissen>Emiel Krahmer,">Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0030/index.html
2016,On the Tragedy of Personnel Evaluation,"In social-dilemma situations (public-good games) people may pursue their local, egoistic interests and thereby lower the global, overall payoff of their group and, paradoxically, even their own resulting payoff. One may also speak of intra-individual dilemmas, where people pursue local goals at the expense of their overall utility. Our experiments transfer this idea to personnel evaluation. Participants were put in the position of a Human Resources manager, who should for instance select workers who optimize the overall payoff of the company, rather than those who optimize only their specific payoffs. The results, however, suggest that most, albeit not all, participants tended to focus on directly comparing individuals without considering the overall contribution to a group. Thus employees with the best overall effects for a company may be evaluated the most negatively. This possible ‘tragedy of personnel evaluation’ may have a substantial negative impact on the effectiveness of companies or organizations.",>Momme von Sydow>Niels Braus,">University of Munich, Munich, Germany>University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0031/index.html
2016,Are we ON the same page? Monolingual and bilingual acquisition of familiar and novel relational language,"Verbs and prepositions pose significant challenges in second language learning, as languages differ in how they map these relational terms onto events. Second language learners must put aside their language-specific lens to uncover how a new language operates, perhaps having to rediscover semantic distinctions typically ignored in the first language. The current study examines how the acquisition of these novel mappings are affected by characteristics of the learner and of the language to be learned. English monolinguals and Dutch-English bilinguals learned novel terms that corresponded to containment and support relations of either English, Dutch, or Japanese. Results show that English distinctions are learned best across groups, potentially reflecting predispositions in human cognition. No differences were found between monolinguals and bilinguals in any language condition. The characteristics of the language to be learned appear to play a prominent role in the acquisition of novel semantic categories.",>Nathan George>Junko Kanero>Dorothee Chwilla>Daniel Weiss,">Department of Psychology, Penn State University, University Park, PA, 16802 USA>Department of Psychology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19122 USA>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University

2016,Dissociable effects of cue validity on bias formation and reversal,"In two experiments we manipulated the prior probability of occurrence for two alternatives. After a first learning session, in a second session the cue to bias the decision was reversed. Our investigation shows that subjects are able to learn the reverse bias only when the bias of the first session is in line with their expected outcome. When, during the first session, the actual outcome of the bias is not in line with the expected outcome, there is an inhibition for the reversal bias learning in the second session. We investigate this phenomenon with computational models of choice showing that the inhibition of reversal is due to an increase in the rate at which subjects accumulate evidence for repeated, unexpected stimuli. We discuss a possible theoretical explanation that links this phenomenon to similar results found in the literature on reversal learning and to the effect of novelty on learning.",>Angelo Pirrone>Qi Zhang>Sheng Li,">University of Sheffield, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, United Kingdom>Peking University>Peking University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0033/index.html
2016,Effects of experience in a developmental model of reading,"There is considerable evidence showing that age of acquisition (AoA) is an important factor influencing lexical processing. Early-learned words tend to be processed more quickly compared to later-learned words. The effect could be due to the gradual reduction in plasticity as more words are learned. Alternatively, it could originate from differences within semantic representations. We implemented the triangle model of reading including orthographic, phonological and semantic processing layers, and trained it according to experience of a language learner to explore the AoA effects in both naming and lexical decision. Regression analyses on the model’s performance showed that AoA was a reliable predictor of naming and lexical decision performance, and the effect size was larger for lexical decision than for naming. The modelling results demonstrate that AoA operates differentially on concrete and abstract words, indicating that both the mapping and the representation accounts of AoA were contributing to the model’s performance.",>Ya-Ning Chang>Padraic Monaghan>Stephen Welbourne,">Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom>Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom>Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0034/index.html
2016,Differentiating between Encoding and Processing during Sequential Diagnostic Reasoning: An Eye tracking study.,"When finding a best explanation for observed symptoms a multitude of information has to be integrated and matched against explanations stored in memory. Although assumptions about ongoing memory processes can be derived from the process models, little process data exists that would allow to sufficiently test these assumptions. In order to explore memory processes in diagnostic reasoning, 29 participants were asked to solve a visual reasoning task (the Black Box paradigm) where critical information had to be retrieved from memory. This study focused on differentiating between processes that take place during the encoding and the evaluation of symptom information by comparing eye movement measures (the number of fixation and fixation duration per dwell). Results will be discussed in light of existing theories on sequential diagnostic reasoning. Further, it will be discussed to which extent eye movements can be informative about memory processes underlying sequential diagnostic reasoning.",>Anja Klichowicz>Agnes Scholz>Sascha Strehlau>Josef F.

2016,Young children and adults integrate past expectations and current outcomes to reason about others’ emotions,"Reasoning about others’ emotions is a crucial component in social cognition. Here, we tested the ability of preschool children to reason about an agent’s emotions following an unexpected outcome. Importantly, we controlled for the actual payoff of the outcome, while varying the prior expectation of the agents. Five year olds, but not four year olds, were able to correctly judge an agent’s emotions following an unexpected outcome (Experiment 1). However, when explicitly provided with the agent’s expectations, four year old children were then able to correctly judge the agent’s feelings (Experiment 2). Thus, our results suggest that the ability to reason about emotions given outcomes and prior expectations develops by 4 years of age, while the ability to spontaneously infer such prior expectations develops soon after. We discuss our results in light of the developmental literature on emotion understanding and counter- factual reasoning.",>Desmond Ong>Mika Asaba>Hyowon Gweon,">Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0036/index.html
2016,Language does not explain the wine-specific memory advantage of wine experts,"Although people are poor at naming odors, naming a smell helps to remember that odor. Previous studies show wine experts have better memory for smells, and they also name smells differently than novices. Is wine experts’ odor memory is verbally mediated? And is the odor memory advantage that experts have over novices restricted to odors in their domain of expertise, or does it generalize? Twenty-four wine experts and 24 novices smelled wines, wine-related odors and common odors, and remembered these. Half the participants also named the smells. Wine experts had better memory for wines, but not for the other odors, indicating their memory advantage is restricted to wine. Wine experts named odors better than novices, but there was no relationship between experts’ ability to name odors and their memory for odors. This suggests experts’ odor memory advantage is not linguistically mediated, but may be the result of differential perceptual learning.",>Ilja Croijmans>Asifa Majid,">Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands

The present study examines whether the advantage is due to other sub-categorical properties (e.g., orthographic similarity and word frequency) rather than an artifact of stimuli used in previous studies (e.g., numbers vs. nouns). Participants were presented with numeric stimuli and nouns from a variety of semantic categories while their orthography and word frequency were systematically manipulated. The results suggest that a large portion of the COE can be attributed to the sub-categorical properties of the items.",>Jordan Schoenherr>Robert Thomson,>Carleton University>United States Military Academy,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0038/index.html
2016,Causal Learning With Continuous Variables Over Time,"When estimating the strength of the relation between a cause (X) and effect (Y), there are two main statistical approaches that can be used. The first is using a simple correlation. The second approach, appropriate for situations in which the variables are observed unfolding over time, is to take a correlation of the change scores – whether the variables reliably change in the same or opposite direction. The main question of this manuscript is whether lay people use change scores for assessing causal strength in time series contexts. We found that subjects’ causal strength judgments were better predicted by change scores than the simple correlation, and that use of change scores was facilitated by naturalistic stimuli. Further, people use a heuristic of simplifying the magnitudes of change scores into a binary code (increase vs. decrease). These findings help explain how people uncover true causal relations in complex time series contexts.",>Kevin Soo>Benjamin Rottman,">University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0039/index.html
2016,Viewing time affects overspecification: Evidence for two strategies of attribute selection during reference production,"Speakers often produce definite referring expressions that are overspecified: they tend to include more attributes than neces- sary to distinguish the target referent. The current paper inves- tigates how the occurrence of overspecification is affected by viewing time. We conducted an experiment in which speakers were asked to refer to target objects in visual domains. Half of the speakers had unlimited time to inspect the domains, while viewing time was limited (1000 ms) for the other half. The results reveal that limited viewing time induces the occurrence of overspecification. We conjecture that limited viewing time caused speakers to rely heavily on quick heuristics during attribute selection, which urge them to select attributes that are perceptually salient. In the case of unlimited inspection time, speakers seem to rely on a combination of heuristic and more deliberate selection strategies.",>Ruud Koolen>Albert Gatt>Roger Van Gompel>Emiel Krahmer>Kees Van Deemter,>Tilburg University>University of Malta>University of Dundee>Tilburg University>University of Aberdeen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0040/index.html
2016,Trump supported it?! A Bayesian source credibility model applied to appeals to specific American presidential candidates’ opinions,"The credibility of politicians is crucial to their persuasiveness as election candidates. The paper applies a parameter-free Baysian source credibility model (integrating trustworthiness and epistemic authority) in a real-life test predicting participants’ posterior belief in the goodness of an unnamed policy after a named candidate has publically supported or attacked it. Two studies test model predictions against policy support and attack of five presidential candidates from the USA. Model predictions were measured against observed posterior belief in the goodness of the policy. The results strongly suggest the model captures essential traits of how participants update beliefs in policies given appeals to a candidates’ support of attack. Further, individual differences suggest that people consider other factors than the ones elicited for the study. More studies into appeals to specific candidates are warranted to construct more accurate models of the influence of source credibility on political reasoning",>Jens Koed Madsen,">Birkbeck, University of London, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0041/index.html
2016,Expressive faces are remembered with less pictorial fidelity than neutral faces,"A repeated finding in the literature of face recognition is that expressive faces are remembered better than neutral faces. However, a better facial-identity recognition may come at a cost of a reduced precision with which the pictorial facial features, irrelevant for identity recognition, are represented in memory. By means of a continuous-report task, we tested this hypothesis by measuring the memory precision of expressive and neutral faces. Commensurable face-identity and facial-expressions variations were generated with the method of Fechnerian scaling. The results confirm our hypothesis, but only under conditions of high memory load. We interpret the present findings as due to the effects of the categorical processes required for facial-identity recognition.",>Martina Lorenzino>Giorgio Gronchi>Corrado Caudek,>University of Florence>University of Florence>University of Florence,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0042/index.html

We assumed that during decision making process, there is a transit from an exploration to a decision-making period, and this behavior can be better captured with a Switching HMM (SHMM). Through clustering individual eye movement patterns described in SHMMs, we automatically discovered two groups of participants with different decision making behavior. One group showed a strong bias to look more often at the to-be chosen stimulus (i.e., the gaze cascade effect; Shimojo et al., 2003) with a short decision-making period. The other group showed a weaker cascade effect with a longer decision-making period. The SHMMs also showed capable of inferring participants’ preference choice on each trial with high accuracy. Thus, our SHMM approach made it possible to reveal individual differences in decision making and discover individual preferences from eye movements.",>Tim Chuk>Antoni B.

2016,Semantic Contamination of Visual Similarity Judgments,"The roles of semantic and perceptual information in cognition are of widespread interest to many researchers. However, disentangling their contributions is complicated by their overlap in real-world categories. For instance, attempts to calibrate visual similarity based on participant judgments are undermined by the possibility that semantic knowledge contaminates these judgments. This study investigated whether inverting stimuli attenuates semantic contamination of visual similarity judgments in adults and children. Participants viewed upright and inverted triads of familiar animals, and judged which of two test items looked most like the target. One test item belonged to the same category as the target, and one belonged to a different category. Test items’ visual similarity to the target either corresponded or conflicted with category membership. Across age groups, conflicting category membership reduced accuracy and slowed reaction times to a greater extent in upright than inverted triads. Therefore, inversion attenuates semantic contamination of visual similarity judgments.",>Layla Unger>Anna Fisher,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0045/index.html

We modify the trajectory serial reaction time (SRT) task, used to teach people a consistent sequence of mouse movements by cueing them with the next target response. We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) version of the paradigm in which no cue appears. Instead, learners must explore response alternatives, receiving penalties when incorrect and rewards when correct. Learners are not told that they will learn a single deterministic sequence of responses, nor that it will repeat (nor how often), nor how long it is. Performance was bimodal: half performed poorly, and yet half performed remarkably well, acquiring the full 10-item sequence within 10 repetitions. We compare these groups’ detailed results in this RL task with a cued trajectory SRT task, finding both similarities and discrepancies. Human learners outperform three standard RL models and have different patterns of errors.",>George Kachergis>Floris Berends>Roy de Kleijn>Bernhard Hommel,">New York University>Leiden University>Leiden University / Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, Netherlands>Leiden University / Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0046/index.html
2016,The Role of the Prefrontal Cortex in Inductive Reasoning: An fNIRS Study,"This study examined neural activity associated with inductive inference using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Induction is a powerful way of generating new knowledge by generalizing known information to novel items or contexts. Two key bases for identifying targets for induction are perceptual similarity, and rules that specify category-relevant features. Similarity- and rule-based induction have been argued to represent distinct mechanisms, such that only rule-based induction requires executive function processes associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), namely: active maintenance of representations and inhibition of salient but irrelevant features. Here, we address the lack of direct empirical evidence supporting this possibility by recording PFC activity using fNIRS while adult participants (n=24) performed an inductive inference task. We found that PFC activity during induction was greater when participants had been taught a category-inclusion rule versus when participants could only rely on overall similarity.",>Layla Unger>Jaeah Kim>Theodore Huppert>Julia Badger>Anna Fisher,">Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>University of Pittsburgh, Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Clinical Science Translational Institute, Departments of Radiology and Bioengineering>University of Oxford>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0047/index.html

To develop the models, we consider a total of 8 previously proposed cue measures, based on cue validity and discriminability, and develop simple Bayesian and biased-Bayesian learning mechanisms for inferring these measures from experience. We evaluate the model predictions against people’s search behavior in an experiment in which people could freely search cues for information to decide between two stimuli. Our results show that people’s behavior is best predicted by models relying on cue measures maximizing short-term accuracy, rather than long-term exploration, and using the biased learning mechanism that increases the certainty of inferences about cue properties, but does not necessarily learn true environmental contingencies.",>Percy Mistry>Michael Lee>Ben Newell,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine>University of New South Wales",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0049/index.html

We hypothesize that people’s beliefs about the real world can be changed similarly to the way systematic incorrect memories and systematic incorrect beliefs (which we call memory-based false belief) are generated. We also predict that since memory-based false beliefs are consistent with abstract knowledge that is consisted with prototypical patterns and organization found in the real world, false beliefs work adaptively in making inferences about environmental information in the real world. We conducted behavioral and simulation studies in order to examine our hypotheses on people’s beliefs and inferences about the real world. The results showed that participants had systematic false beliefs about cities’ attributes (e.g., whether they have a professional baseball team), and that such false beliefs worked adaptively in making inferences about population size.",>Hidehito Honda>Toshihiko Matsuka>Kazuhiro Ueda,>The University of Tokyo>Chiba University>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0051/index.html

In contrast to other dynamic events in the natural world, human actions involve mental processes that enable willful bodily movements. We reported two experiments to demonstrate that human observers spontaneously assign the role of cause to relative limb movements, and the role of effect to body motion (i.e., the position changes of the body center of mass) when observing actions of others. Experiment 1 showed that this causal action constraint impacts people’s impression on the naturalness of observed actions. Experiment 2a/b revealed that the causal constraint guides the integration of different motion cues within a relational schema. We developed an ideal observer model to rule out the possibility that these effects resulted from the learning of statistical regularity in action stimuli. These findings demonstrate that causal relations concerning bodily movements play an important role in perceiving and understanding actions.",>Yujia Peng>Steven Thurman>Hongjing Lu,">Psychology Department, UCLA>Psychology Department, UCLA>Psychology and Statistics Department, UCLA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0052/index.html

Many studies suggest that, in addition to looking at quantitative differences in block design speed or accuracy, observing qualitative differences in individuals' problem-solving strategies can provide valuable information about a person's cognition. However, it can be difficult to tie theories at the level of problem-solving strategy to predictions at the level of externally observable behaviors such as gaze shifts and patterns of errors. We present a computational architecture that is used to compare different models of problem-solving on the block design task and to generate detailed behavioral predictions for each different strategy.

2016,Preferring the Mighty to the Meek: Toddlers prefer Superior to Subordinate Individuals.,"Every human society includes social hierarchies—relationships between individuals and groups of unequal rank or status. Recent research has shown that even preverbal infants represent hierarchical relationships, expecting larger agents and agents from larger groups to win dominance contests. However, to successfully navigate social hierarchies, infants must also integrate information about social rank into their own behavior, such as when deciding which individuals to approach and which to avoid. Here we demonstrate that two-year-old children (ages 21-31 months) preferred novel dominant agents to subordinates. That is, by the age of 21 months, toddlers not only use phylogenetically stable cues to predict the winner of dominance contests, they also like the dominant agents better. This finding suggests that young children use their ability to infer relative rank to selectively approach dominant individuals.",>Ashley J.

We also extend prior research by including both measures of sharing behavior and children’s evaluations of sharing scenarios, and by investigating a larger sample (N=164) with a broader age range than is typical of prior research (5- to 9-year-olds). We found that, across the entire age range tested, children were generous when observed and gave more to in-group members than out-group members, and that there was no interaction between these effects.

While such practice has been shown to be effective in educational research, previous findings in the memory literature suggest that exposure to an incorrect solution may lead students to later believe that it is correct due to increased familiarity. We designed a two-session experiment with 1-week delay in which students studied correct and incorrect worked out examples. We found only small changes in students’ ability to successfully distinguish between correct and incorrect solutions over time. Students did rate the previously studied incorrect examples as being more correct after the 1-wk delay, but this did not affect their correctness ratings of new correct and incorrect worked examples or their problem solving accuracy. We conclude that the unique nature of mathematical problem solving may protect students from the dangers of using incorrect worked examples.",>Min Kyung Hong>Darren J.

Verbal labels for the stimuli and stimulus individuation have been shown to facilitate the formation, testing, and application of category membership rules (Fotiadis & Protopapas, 2014). We sought to replicate the phenomenon of facilitation due to verbal names for the stimuli by training participants for two consecutive days to either learn new names for abstract shapes, or learn shape-ideogram pairings; a third group was unexposed to the shapes. After training, participants were given a Type II categorization task—thought to be mediated by verbal processes of rule discovery—utilizing the trained shapes. We hypothesized that verbal labels for the shapes and shape individuation would provide facilitative effects in learning to categorize. Results revealed no effect of training on categorization performance.

If we take these objections seriously, and I will argue that we should, there are two possible responses: 1. We are mistaken that representation is the locus of our cognitive capacities; or, 2. Our representational capacities do give us critical cognitive advantages, but they are not fundamental to us qua human beings. As Andy Clark has convincingly argued, anti-representationalism, option one, is explanatorily weak. Consequently, I will argue, we need to take the second option seriously. In the first half of the paper I rehearse the problems with the current representational view and in the second half of the paper I defend and give a sketch of a two-systems view of cognition – a non-representational perceptual system coupled with a representational language-dependent one – and look at some consequences of the view.",>Nancy Salay,>Queen's University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0063/index.html

Here we extend such effects to the political domain and investigate the temporal persistence of induced preferences, as well as, the possible role the length of confabulatory justifications may play. We conducted a two-day choice blindness experiment using political statements, with sessions being roughly one week apart. Changes in political preferences remained one week after initial responses, and were most prominent in participants who were allowed to confabulate freely. These findings, being the first to demonstrate lasting preference change using choice blindness, are discussed in light of constructivist approaches to attitude formation through a process of self-perception.",>David Sivén>Thomas Strandberg>Lars Hall>Petter Johansson>Philip Pärnamets,">Lund University Cognitive Science, Lund, Sweden>Lund University Cognitive Science, Lund, Sweden>Lund University Cognitive Science, Lund, Sweden>Lund University Cognitive Science, Lund, Sweden; Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study, Linneanum, Uppsala, Sweden>Lund University Cognitive Science, Lund, Sweden; Division of Psychology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0064/index.html
2016,How should autonomous vehicles behave in moral dilemmas? Human judgments reflect abstract moral principles,"Self-driving autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to make the world a safer and cleaner place. A challenge confronting the development of AVs is how these vehicles should behave in traffic situations where harm is unavoidable. It is important that AVs behave in ethically appropriate ways to mitigate harm. Ideally, they should obey a system of principles that both concur with human moral judgments and are ethically defensible. Here we compare people’s moral judgments of AV programming with their judgments about the behavior of human drivers, with the goal of beginning to identify such principles. As many debates within ethics remain unresolved, empirical investigations like ours may guide the development of ethical AVs (Bonnefon et al., 2015). In addition, people’s judgments about the behavior of AVs may serve as a window into the abstract principles people apply in their moral reasoning.",>Derek Powell>Patricia Cheng>Michael Waldmann,">University of California, Los Angeles, California>University of California, Los Angeles>University of Göttingen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0065/index.html
2016,Examining Search Processes in Low and High Creative Individuals with Random Walks,"The creative process involves several cognitive processes, such as working memory, controlled attention and task switching. One other process is cognitive search over semantic memory. These search processes can be controlled (e.g., problem solving guided by a heuristic), or uncontrolled (e.g., mind wandering). However, the nature of this search in relation to creativity has rarely been examined from a formal perspective. To do this, we use a random walk model to simulate uncontrolled cognitive search over semantic networks of low and high creative individuals with an equal number of nodes and edges. We show that a random walk over the semantic network of high creative individuals “finds” more unique words and moves further through the network for a given number of steps. Our findings are consistent with the associative theory of creativity, which posits that the structure of semantic memory facilitates search processes to find creative solutions.",>Yoed Kenett>Joseph Austerweil,">Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, United States>Brown University, Providence, RI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0066/index.html
2016,Determining the alternatives for scalar implicature,"Successful communication regularly requires listeners to make pragmatic inferences --- enrichments beyond the literal meaning of a speaker's utterance. For example, when interpreting a sentence such as ""Alice ate some of the cookies,"" listeners routinely infer that Alice did not eat all of them. A Gricean account of this phenomenon assumes the presence of alternatives (like ""all of the cookies"") with varying degrees of informativity, but it remains an open question precisely what these alternatives are. To address this question, we collect empirical measurements of speaker and listener judgments about varying sets of alternatives across a range of scales and use these as inputs to a computational model of pragmatic inference. This approach allows us to test hypotheses about how well different sets of alternatives predict pragmatic judgments by people. Our findings suggest that comprehenders likely consider a broader set of alternatives beyond those logically entailed by the initial message.",>Benjamin Peloquin>Mike Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0067/index.html
2016,The Role of Similarity in Constructive Memory: Evidence from Tasks with Children and Adults,"Literature on memory research shows that when memorizing, people may blend two situations, i.e. when memorizing one story, they add elements from another story. Most of the cognitive models assume that the superficial similarity between two episodes is the primary factor for blending. However, there is evidence that people blend dissimilar stories as well, if these stories share the same relational structure. We contrasted the two factors in a single study and performed experiments with the same design and stimuli with adults and with 4-5-year-old children. The results show that there is no qualitative difference between the performance of adults and children. Also, both adults and children blend either pictures that have surface or structural similarity depending on the abstractness of the objects in them.",>Georgi Petkov>Margarita Pavlova,>New Bulgarian University NBU>New Bulgarian University NBU,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0068/index.html

2016,A neurocomputational model of the effect of learned labels on infants’ object representations,"The effect of labels on nonlinguistic representations is the focus of substantial debate in the developmental literature. A recent empirical study (Twomey & Westermann, under review) suggested that labels are incorporated into object representations, such that infants respond differently to objects for which they know a label relative to unlabeled objects. However, these empirical data cannot differentiate between two recent theories of integrated label-object representations, one of which assumes labels are features of object representations, and one which assumes labels are represented separately, but become closely associated with learning. We address this issue using a neurocomputational (autoencoder) model to instantiate both theoretical approaches. Simulation data support an account in which labels are features of objects, with the same representational status as the objects’ visual and haptic characteristics.",>Arthur Capelier-Mourguy>Katherine Twomey>Gert Westermann,">Lancaster University, UK>Lancaster University, UK>Lancaster University, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0070/index.html
2016,A neural network model of hierarchical category development,"Object recognition and categorization is a fundamental aspect of cognition in humans and animals. Models have been implemented around the idea that categories are sets of frequently co-occurring features. Out of these models a question has been raised, namely what is the mechanism by which we learn a hierarchically organized set of categories, including types and subtypes? In this paper we introduce such a model, the Dominant Property Assembly Network (DPAN). DPAN uses an unsupervised neural network to model an agent which develops a hierarchy of object categories based on highly correlated object features. Initially, the network generates representations of high-level object types by identifying commonly co-occurring sets of features. Over time, the network will start to use an inhibition of return (IOR) operation to examine the features of a categorized object that make it unusual as an instance of its identified category.",>Chris Gorman>Alistair Knott,>University of Otago>University of Otago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0071/index.html
2016,Improving Visual Memory with Auditory Input,"Can input in one sensory modality strengthen memory in a different sensory modality? To address this question, we asked participants to encode images presented in various locations (e.g., a dog in the top left corner of the screen) while they heard spatially uninformative sounds. Some of these sounds matched the image (e.g., the word “dog” or a barking sound) while others did not. In a subsequent memory test, participants were better at remembering the locations of images that were encoded with a matching sound, even though these sounds were spatially uninformative – an effect that was mediated by whether the sounds were verbal or non-verbal. Because the sounds did not provide any relevant location information, better spatial memory cannot be attributed to auditory memory; rather, it is attributed to visual memory being strengthened by the matching auditory input. These findings provide the first behavioral evidence for cross-modal interactions in memory.",>Scott R.

2016,Measuring lay theories of parenting and child development,"Parenting practices are known to play an important role in shaping children’s outcomes. For example, children whose parents engage them in high-quality conversations and who are given opportunities for free play are at an advantage for learning and later academic outcomes. However, communicating the results of relevant scientific findings to parents remains a challenge. One possible moderator of uptake of parenting information is the implicit theories parents hold with regard to child development and parenting. As a first step in investigating this possibility, the present work establishes a new measure of parenting attitudes including three subscales corresponding to attitudes about rules and respect, affection and attachment, and early learning. We then examine whether subscale scores predict uptake of new information about children’s learning. Scores on the Early Learning subscale, but not the Rules and Respect subscale, predicted generalization from the article, providing initial evidence of the validity of this measure.",>Emily Hembacher>Michael C Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0073/index.html

Previous work in lay psychology of behavior have tended to treat emotion as causing primarily unintentional behavior (e.g., being sad causes one to cry), neglecting how people incorporate emotions into explanations of rational, intentional actions. Here, we provide preliminary explorations into integrating emotions into a theory of folk psychology. Specifically, we show that in the lay theory, people are willing to endorse emotions as causes of intentional actions. Moreover, people readily attribute beliefs and desires as explanations for emotional expressions. This work provides a first step in elaborating people’s rich understanding of emotions as an important component of intuitive social cognition.",>Desmond Ong>Jamil Zaki>Noah Goodman,">Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0074/index.html
2016,But vs. Although under the microscope,"Previous experimental studies on concessive connectives have only looked at their local facilitating or predictive effect on discourse relation comprehension and have often viewed them as a class of discourse markers with similar effects. We look into the effect of two connectives, but and although, for inferring contrastive vs. concessive discourse relations to complement previous experimental work on causal inferences. An offline survey on AMTurk and an online eye-tracking-while-reading experiment are conducted to show that even between these two connectives, which mark the same set of relations, interpretations are biased. The bias is consistent with the distribution of the connective across discourse relations. This suggests that an account of discourse connective meaning based on probability distributions can better account for comprehension data than a classic categorical approach, or an approach where closely related connectives only have a core meaning and the rest of the interpretation comes from the discourse arguments.",>Fatemeh Torabi Asr>Vera Demberg,">Indiana University, Bloomington, USA>Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0075/index.html

We investigated: 1) Can we measure improvement on core concepts? 2) Do lessons with 3D models improve student outcomes on these measures? and 3) What factors mediate learning?

2016,Structure-sensitive Noise Inference: Comprehenders Expect Exchange Errors,"Previous research has found that comprehenders are willing to adopt non-literal interpretations of sentences whose literal reading is unlikely. Several studies found evidence that comprehenders decide whether a given utterance should be taken at face value in accordance with principles of Bayesian rationality, by weighing the prior probability of potential interpretations against the degree to which they are (in)consistent with the literal form of the utterance. While all of these results are consistent with string-edit noise models, many error processes are known to be sensitive to the underlying linguistic structure of the intended utterance. Here, we explore the case of exchange errors and provide experimental evidence that comprehenders' noise model is structure-sensitive. Our results add further support to the noisy-channel theory of language comprehension, extend the set of known noise operations to include positional exchanges, and show that comprehenders' noise models are well-adapted to structure-sensitive sources of signal corruption.",>Till Poppels>Roger Levy,">University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0077/index.html

Previous research has focussed on the low representation of women in chess. We replicate and extend previous analysis (Chabris and Glickman, 2006) on an international level. We find no support for differential variability, differential drop-out between male and female players, or social context (in the form of proportion of female players at a national level) as drivers of drivers of male-female differences. Further, we examine games between mixed and same gender pairs for evidence of a `stereotype threat' effect. Contrary to previous reports, we find no evidence of stereotype threat. Though this analysis contradicts one specific mechanism whereby gender stereotype may influence players, the persistent differences between male and female players suggests that systematic factors do exist and remain to be uncovered.",>Tom Stafford,>University of Sheffield,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0078/index.html

Using the ‘which outcome’ methodology (Teigen & Filkuková, 2013), we examined the effect of using verbal, numerical and mixed communication formats, as well as investigating whether marking outcomes as salient would alter the outcomes people perceived as ‘unlikely’ or having a 20% chance of occurring. We observed no effect of saliency, but replicated previous findings, with general preference for values at the high end of a distribution (including maximum/above maximum values) present in both verbal and mixed communication formats. This demonstrates the relevance of these findings for real-world consequential risk communication. Whilst the estimates differed between the mixed and numerical formats, we found that the mixed format yielded the more accurate estimates.",>Sarah Jenkins>Adam Harris>Murray Lark,>University College London>University College London>British Geological Survey,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0079/index.html
2016,Visual Statistical Learning Deficits in Children with Developmental Dyslexia: an Event Related Potential Study,"Extensive research suggests that individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD) perform below typical readers on non-linguistic cognitive tasks involving the learning and encoding of statistical-sequential patterns. However, research investigating the neural mechanisms underlying such a deficit is inadequate. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ERP correlates of sequence processing in a sample of children diagnosed with DD using a probabilistic visual serial learning paradigm. Behavioral results revealed that whereas age-matched typically developing (TD) children (n=12) showed learning in the task as reflected by their reaction times, the children with dyslexia (n=8) showed no effects of learning. Additionally, ERPs of the TD children showed a P300-like response indicative of this paradigm (Jost et al., 2015); whereas, children diagnosed with a reading disorder showed no such ERP effects. These findings are consistent with the idea that differences in statistical-sequential learning ability might underlie the reading deficits observed in DD.",>Sonia Singh>Anne Walk>Christopher Conway,">Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0080/index.html

Since inception multiple solutions have been proposed, including the influential expected utility theory. Criticisms remain due to the lack of a priori justification for the utility function. Here we report a new solution to the long-standing paradox, which focuses on the probability weighting component (rather than the value/utility component) in calculating the expected value of the game.

Both models assume that people estimate probability using formal processes that follow or subsume standard probability theory. The quantum probability model predicts people's estimates should agree with one set of probability theory identities, while the probability theory plus noise model predicts a specific pattern of violation of those identities. Experimental results show just the form of violation predicted by the probability theory plus noise model. These results suggest that people's probability judgments do not follow quantum probability: instead, they follow the rules of standard probability theory, with the systematic biases seen in those judgments due to the effects of random noise.",>Fintan Costello>Paul Watts,>University College Dublin>National University of Ireland Maynooth,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0082/index.html

The results of the study indicated that using a 3D-printed object produced more accurate task performance and faster mental model construction of a liver structure than a 3D image.

The present study sought to identify whether the right-frontal fMRI activation seen in a number of case studies in patients with left-sided brain lesions exists as a group-level trend in patients with left-frontal tumors. It also sought to examine the possible compensatory nature of this activation. Thus, a retrospective analysis of 197 brain tumor patients who had undergone pre-surgical fMRI language mapping was conducted. Patients with left-frontal tumors were found to be more likely to show right- or co-dominant fMRI activation during language mapping tasks compared to patients who had tumors elsewhere in the brain.

We extend these ideas to the case of metaphorical descriptions of emotion in Spanish – some of them featuring the emotion as a located entity in the person´s body, and some of them featuring emotion as the ground in which the person´s body stands.

But what determines explanatory power remains unclear. Our study clarifies this issue by asking: How does the explanatory power of a hypothesis cohere with other cognitive factors? How does probabilistic information affect explanatory judgments? To answer these questions, we conducted an experiment, where participants made judgments about a potentially explanatory hypothesis and its cognitive virtues. In the responses, we isolated three constructs: Explanatory Value, Rational Acceptability, and Entailment. While explanatory judgments strongly cohered with judgments of causal relevance and with a sense of understanding, Explanatory Value was sensitive to manipulations of statistical relevance relations between hypothesis and evidence, but not to explicit information about the prior probability of the hypothesis. These results indicate that probabilistic information about statistical relevance is a strong determinant of Explanatory Value, and that abductive and probabilistic reasoning are two distinct modes of inference.",>Matteo Colombo>Marie Nilsenova>Jan Sprenger,">Tilbug Center  for Logic and Philosophy of Science, University of Tilburg>Tilburg University>Tilbug Center  for Logic and Philosophy of Science, University of Tilburg",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0086/index.html
2016,Item Learning vs. High-Level Categorization in Consistent-Mapping Memory Search,"We explore the ways long-term learning improves short-term memory search. In varied mapping (VM) targets on one trial are foils on the next and vice versa; in consistent mapping (CM), targets and foils never change roles. CM training leads to highly efficient search. Two mechanisms may underlie the effect: ‘Item Learning’ in which each item comes to be associated to the appropriate ‘target’ or ‘foil’ response, and ‘Category Learning’ in which all items come to be coded as members of a category. Categorical varied mapping (CV) allows these to be distinguished: Members of a category have the same role on each trial, but the role switches between trials. Using arbitrary pictures as stimuli we show that, during early stages of practice, item learning and not category learning governs responding in both CM and CV.

2016,The impact of biased hypothesis generation on self-directed learning,"Self-directed learning confers a number of advantages relative to passive observation, including the ability to test hypotheses rather than learn from data generated by the environment. However, it remains unclear to what extent self-directed learning is constrained by basic cognitive processes and how those limits are related to the structure of the to-be-learned material. The present study examined how hypothesis generation affects the success of self-directed learning of categorical rules. Two experiments manipulated the hypothesis generation process and assessed its impact on the ability to learn 1D and 2D rules. Performance was strongly influenced by whether the stimulus representation facilitated the generation of hypotheses consistent with the target rule. Broadly speaking, the findings suggest that the opportunity to actively gather information is not enough to guarantee successful learning, and that the efficacy of self-directed learning closely depends on how hypothesis generation is shaped by the structure of the learning environment.",>Doug Markant,>Max Planck Institute for Human Development,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0088/index.html

2016,Attractivity Weighting: Take-the-Best's Foolproof Sibling,"We describe a prediction method called ""Attractivity Weighting"" (AW). In the case of cue-based paired comparison tasks, AW's prediction is based on a weighted average of the cue values of the most successful cues. In many situations, AW's prediction is based on the cue value of the most successful cue, resulting in behavior similar to Take-the-Best (TTB). Unlike TTB, AW has a desirable characteristic called ""access optimality"": Its long-run success is guaranteed to be at least as great as the most successful cue. While access optimality is a desirable characteristic, concerns may be raised about the short-term performance of AW. To evaluate such concerns, we here present a study of AW's short-term performance. The results suggest that there is little reason to worry about the short-run performance of AW. Our study also shows that, in random sequences of paired comparison tasks, the behavior of AW and TTB is nearly indiscernible.",>Paul Thorn>Gerhard Schurz,">HHU Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, NRW, Germany>HHU Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, NRW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0090/index.html

Participants engaged in the triad task after a priming phase where they either interacted with a series of objects for their functional capacity, grouped them into or moved them from one table to another.

As the number of doors increased, participants converged on the optimal switch strategy, as well as increasing their confidence in their strategy.

By enabling learners to infer the goal of each step, the causal-contrast approach substantially improved high-school algebra problem solving compared to a traditional instructional control (Walker et al., 2014).

This form then allows us to more transparently see the correspondence between the effect of prior history and current context in the two theories. The results provide insights into the workings of the two theories and open an avenue for future attempts of theory integration, not only between the two theories, but also to related theories of memory. Moreover, we hope these results will be important steps toward testing ACT-R's capabilities of accounting for judgment phenomena.",>Cvetomir Dimov,>University of Lausanne,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0096/index.html
2016,Distributed Cognition in the Past Progressive: Narratives as Representational Tools for Clinical Reasoning,"Cognition may require access to past events, for example to understand undesirable outcomes or diagnose failures. When cognition is distributed between multiple participants, a particular representational challenge occurs because not all of the participants may have directly experienced the focal event. Language can transcend temporal and physical limitations on event accessibility. We suggest that people create complex linguistic constructs as tools to facilitate retrospective cognition. We illustrate this process by analyzing the use of a particular linguistic construct (narrative) in the domain of clinical reasoning. Results demonstrated that narratives support clinical cognition during practitioner-patient interactions. Narratives extended access to clinically relevant events providing information about circumstances, subjective experiences, patient functioning, and prior decisions. Whereas, the hermeneutic nature of narrative allowed collaborative hypothesis testing and creation of meaning. The use of narrative in clinical cognition challenges Bruner’s (1991) distinction between narrative and paradigmatic reasoning and enriches the understanding of medical narratives.",>Katherine Lippa>Valerie Shalin,>Wright State University>Wright State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0097/index.html
2016,Predicting Overprecision in Range Estimation,"Overprecision (overconfidence in interval estimation) is a bias with clear implications for economic outcomes in industries reliant on forecasting possible ranges for future prices and unknown states of nature, such as mineral and petroleum exploration. Prior research has shown the ranges people provide are too narrow given the knowledge they have; that is, they underestimate uncertainty and are overconfident in their knowledge. The underlying causes of this bias are, however, still unclear and individual differences research has shed little light on traits predictive of susceptibility. Taking this as a starting point, this paper directly contrasts the Naïve Sampling Model and Informativeness-Accuracy Tradeoff accounts of overprecision, seeing which better predicts performance in an interval estimation task. This was achieved by identifying traits associated with these theories – Short Term Memory and Need for Cognitive Closure, respectively. Analyses indicate that NFCC but not STM predicts interval width and thus, potentially, impacts overprecision.",>Matthew Kaesler>Matthew Welsh>Carolyn Semmler,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0098/index.html
2016,A Dynamic Neural Field Model of Speech Cue Compensation,"Categorical speech content can often be perceived directly from continuous auditory cues in the speech stream, but human-level performance on speech recognition tasks requires compensation for contextual variables like speaker identity. Regression modeling by McMurray and Jongman (2011) has suggested that for many fricative phonemes, a compensation scheme can substantially increase categorization accuracy beyond even the information from 24 un-compensated raw speech cues. Here, we simulate the same dataset instead using a neurally rather than abstractly implemented model: a hybrid dynamic neural field model and connectionist network. Our model achieved slightly lower accuracy than McMurray and Jongman’s but similar accuracy patterns across most fricatives. Results also compared similarly to more recent models that were also less neurally instantiated but somewhat closer fitting to humans in accuracy. An even less abstracted model is an immediate future goal, as is expanding the present model to additional sensory modalities and constancy/compensation effects.",>Gavin Jenkins>Paul Tupper,>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0099/index.html
2016,The face-space duality hypothesis: a computational model,"Valentine's face-space suggests that faces are represented in a psychological multidimensional space according to their perceived properties. However, the proposed framework was initially designed as an account of invariant facial features only, and explanations for dynamic features representation were neglected. In this paper we propose, develop and evaluate a computational model for a twofold structure of the face-space, able to unify both identity and expression representations in a single implemented model. To capture both invariant and dynamic facial features we introduce the face-space duality hypothesis and subsequently validate it through a mathematical presentation using a general approach to dimensionality reduction. Two experiments with real facial images show that the proposed face-space: (1) supports both identity and expression recognition, and (2) has a twofold structure anticipated by our formal argument.",>Jonathan Vitale>Mary-Anne Williams>Benjamin Johnston,">University of Technology, Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia>University of Technology, Sydney>University of Technology, Sydney",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0100/index.html
2016,Fuse to be used: A weak cue's guide to attracting attention,"Several studies examined cue competition in human learning by testing learners on a combination of conflicting cues rooting for different outcomes, with each cue perfectly predicting its outcome. A common result has been that learners faced with cue conflict choose the outcome associated with the rare cue (the Inverse Base Rate Effect, IBRE). Here, we investigate cue competition including IBRE with sentences containing cues to meanings in a visual world. We do not observe IBRE. Instead we find that position in the sentence strongly influences cue salience. Faced with conflict between an initial cue and a non-initial cue, learners choose the outcome associated with the initial cue, whether frequent or rare. However, a frequent configuration of non-initial cues that are not sufficiently salient on their own can overcome a competing salient initial cue rooting for a different meaning. This provides a possible explanation for certain recurring patterns in language change.",>Zara Harmon>Vsevolod Kapatsinski,>University of Oregon>University of Oregon,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0101/index.html
2016,Stereotype-Based Intuitions: A Psycholinguistic Approach to Experimental Philosophy’s ‘Sources Project’,"Experimental philosophy’s ‘sources project’ seeks to develop psychological explanations of philosophically relevant intuitions which help us assess their evidentiary value. This paper develops a psycholinguistic explanation of intuitions prompted by brief philosophical case-descriptions. For proof of concept, we target intuitions underlying a classic paradox about perception (‘argument from hallucination’). We trace them to stereotype-driven inferences automatically executed in verb comprehension. We employ a forced-choice plausibility-ranking task to show that contextually inappropriate stereotypical inferences are made from less salient uses of the verb “to see”. This yields a debunking explanation which resolves the philosophical paradox.",>Eugen Fischer>Paul Engelhardt,>University of East Anglia>University of East Anglia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0102/index.html

The current study aimed at examining what cues learners use to regulate their effort among multiple sources in a multitext environment. By manipulating the amount of new information and conceptual overlap across texts within a topic, we created three types of text environments to generate different trajectories of two cues to perceived learning, new information (measured by rating of perceived new information) and encoding fluency (measured by ratings of reading ease). Results showed that the dominant cue to gauge perceived learning was the perceived amount of new information.

2016,A Tale of Two Disasters: Biases in Risk Communication,"Risk communication, where scientists inform policy-makers or the populace of the probability and magnitude of possible disasters, is essential to disaster management – enabling people to make better decisions regarding preventative steps, evacuations, etc. Psychological research, however, has identified multiple biases that can affect people’s interpretation of probabilities and thus risk. For example, availability (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973) is known to confound probability estimates while the description-experience gap (D-E Gap) (Hertwig & Erev, 2009) shows low probability events being over-weighted when described and under-weighted when learnt from laboratory tasks. This paper examines how probability descriptions interact with real world experience of events. Responses from 294 participants across 8 conditions showed that people’s responses, given the same described probabilities and consequences, were altered by their familiarity with the disaster (bushfire vs earthquake) and its salience to them personally. The implications of this for risk communication are discussed.",>Matthew Welsh>Sandy Steacy>Steve Begg>Daniel Navarro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0105/index.html

We looked at (i) how individual subjects’ pupil size changes over the course of time and (ii) how well pupil size is predicted by the frequency of the stimuli. The time course of the pupil size was analysed with generalized additive modeling. The results show large individual variations in the pupil response pattern in this very simple task. Although, we see a pupil response to both stimulus onset and articulation onset and offset, both the amplitude of change and the direction of change differ substantially between subjects. This raises the question of what makes the pupil response functions so diverse, and one factor indicated by the frequency effect or the lack thereof might be shallow reading versus reading for content.",>Kaidi Lõo>Jacolien van Rij>Juhani Järvikivi>Harald Baayen,">University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada>University of Groningen, The Netherlands>University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Baden-Würtemberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0106/index.html

Prior work has proposed analogy as a mechanism for commonsense reasoning, with prior simulations focusing on reasoning about continuous behavior of physical systems. This paper examines how analogy might be used in commonsense more broadly. The two contributions are (1) the idea of common sense units, intermediate-sized collections of facts extracted from experience (including cultural experience) which improves analogical retrieval and simplifies inferencing, and (2) analogical chaining, where multiple rounds of analogical retrieval and mapping are used to rapidly construct explanations and predictions. We illustrate these ideas via an implemented computational model, tested on examples from an independently-developed test of commonsense reasoning.",>Joseph Blass>Kenneth Forbus,">Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States>Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0107/index.html
2016,Social Cues Modulate Cognitive Status of Discourse Referents,"We use visual world eye-tracking to test if a speaker’s eye gaze to a potential antecedent modulates the listener’s interpretation of an ambiguous pronoun. Participants listened to stories that included an ambiguous pronoun, such as “The dolphin kisses the goldfish… He….” During the pre-pronominal context, an onscreen narrator gazed at one of the two characters. As expected, participants looked more at the subject character overall. However, this was modulated by the narrator’s eye gaze and the amount of time the participant spent looking at the gaze cue. For trials in which participants attended to the narrator’s eye gaze for > 500ms, participants were significantly more likely to interpret the pronoun as referring to the object if the narrator had previously looked at the object. Results suggest that eye gaze – a social cue – can temper even strong linguistic/cognitive biases in pronoun resolution, such as the subject/first-mention bias.",>Kara Hawthorne>Anja Arnhold>Emily Sullivan>Juhani Järvikivi,>University of Mississippi>University of Konstanz>University of Alberta>University of Alberta,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0108/index.html

Our perceptual system has to make predictions about the sources of the sensory information, based on concepts from perceptual memory in order to create stable and reliable percepts. We presented ambiguous and disambiguated lattice stimuli (variants of the Necker cube) in order to measure a hysteresis effects in visual perception. Fifteen healthy participants observed two periods of ordered sequences of lattices with increasing and decreasing ambiguity and indicated their percepts, in two experimental conditions with different starting stimuli of the ordered sequence. We compared the stimulus parameters at the perceptual reversal between conditions and periods and found significant differences between conditions and periods, indicating memory contributions to perceptual outcomes on three different time scales from milliseconds over seconds up to lifetime memory.

Animations of interacting action pairs (partners in human interactions) and non-interacting action pairs (individual actors sampled from different interaction sequences) were shown in the experiment. Participants were asked to rate how likely the two actors were interacting. The rating data were then analyzed using multidimensional scaling to recover a two-dimensional psychological space for representing joint actions. A descriptive model based on ordinal logit regression with a sparseness constraint was developed to account for human judgments by identifying critical features that signal joint actions. We found that identification of joint actions could be accomplished by assessing inter-actor correlations between motion features derived from body movements of individual actions. These critical features may enable rapid detection of meaningful inter-personal interactions in complex scenes.",>Tianmin Shu>Steven Thurman>Dawn Chen>Song-Chun Zhu>Hongjing Lu,">University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States>University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0110/index.html
2016,Visual constraints modulate stereotypical predictability of agents during situated language comprehension,"We investigated how constraints on the concurrent visual context modulate the use of prior gender and action cues and stereotypical knowledge during situated language comprehension. Participants saw videos of hands performing actions, then inspected the pictures of potential agents (one female one male) during auditory German OVS sentences. Unlike in Rodríguez et al. 2015, the concurrent context included a picture of the videotaped object and a ‘competitor object’. Fixations to the agents' faces were measured during comprehension. We manipulated the match between videotaped actions and those described by the sentence and the stereotypicality match between the described actions and the gender of videotaped agents. We replicated the preference for the target agent's face (gender-matching the videotaped hands). Action-verb mismatch effects emerged earlier and were modulated by stereotypicality.

In addition, pie charts may show some advantages above number lines when translating between representations. Lastly, our findings suggest that the translation between number lines and fractions may be particularly error-prone.

Prior research links intrinsic motivation for learning math with mathematics achievement, particularly during adolescence. The current study measured middle school students’ interest in algebra and their procedural skills across the span of an algebra unit to determine whether students who show declines in algebraic problem-solving also show a decline in a particular type of intrinsic motivation – interest in algebra. Pretest and posttest scores were used to categorize participants into those who showed declines in problem-solving skills and those who did not.

Using a novel measure of noun richness, it is shown that the ratio of nouns to verbs in young children’s speech is considerably higher than in adult speech. Simulations with MOSAIC show that this effect can be partially (but not completely) explained by an utterance-final bias in learning.

2016,The comprehension of English Garden-path sentences by Mandarin and Korean learners of English as a second language,"The present study investigated the relative contributions of verb bias and plausibility in sentence processing in native English speakers and L2 learners. Ten direct-object-biased and ten sentential-complement-biased verbs were used in Experiment 1 to construct 80 items containing embedded clauses in ambiguous and unambiguous versions. Verb bias and complementizer cues were each sufficient for native speakers for disambiguation, but both had to be present for L1-Mandarin learners. Both higher and lower proficiency L1-Mandarin learners could use verb bias cues but only higher proficiency L1-Korean learners could do so (Lee, Lu, & Garnsey, 2013), suggesting that L1 word order (Mandarin SVO; Korean SOV) influences how quickly L2 learners learn word-order-dependent cues about L2 structures. Experiment 2 showed that neither native speakers nor L2 learners (L1-Mandarin & L1-Korean) used plausibility cues, replicating previous findings in English and challenging the claim that L2 learners rely primarily on lexical-semantic cues during on-line sentence processing.",>Zhiying Qian,>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0116/index.html

We report the results of an experiment where participants were asked to choose between two options: a dynamic and risky option that resulted in either a high or a low outcome, and a stationary and safe option that resulted in a medium outcome. The probability of the high outcome in the risky option decreased or increased linearly over the course of the task while the probability of the medium outcome stayed the same throughout. We find that adaptation to change is related to the direction of that change, and that the way people adapt to changing probabilities relates to their willingness to explore available options.

Recent empirical work suggests people might also reason using qualitative causal networks. In two studies, participants read a realistic trial transcript and judge guilt and witness credibility. Study 1 varied testimonial consistency and defendant character. Guilt and credibility assessments were affected by consistency but not prior convictions. Study 2 constructed a BN to represent consistency issues. Individual parameter estimates were elicited for the corresponding BN to compute posterior predictions for guilt and credibility.

In Experiment 1 5-year-olds and adults learned rule-based categories. They were then presented with an Induction-then-Recognition task. Similar to previous results with familiar categories, children exhibited better memory for items than adults. In Experiment 2, adults learned similarity-based categories and then were presented with an Induction-then-Recognition task.

Thus far, studies have focused on behavioral effects, rather than examining the neural underpinnings of different behaviors shown in human-agent interactions. Here, we used a multi-round negotiation platform, instead of the more common single-shot negotiation, and were able to find distinct brain patterns in emotion-related regions of the brain during different types of offers. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis to analyze brain imaging data acquired during functional MRI scanning, we show that it is possible to predict whether the negotiator concedes, does not change, or asks for more during the negotiation. Most importantly, we demonstrate that left dorsal anterior insula, which is known to be an emotion-related brain region, shows a different pattern of activity for each of the three offer types.",>Eunkyung Kim>Sarah Gimbel>Aleksandra Litvinova>Jonas Kaplan>Morteza Dehghani,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0121/index.html

Such tasks afford diverse means to tradeoff one type of performance for another, combining task elements in novel ways to yield method variations and strategy discoveries that, if mastered, might produce large or small leaps in performance. For the researcher interested in the development of extreme expertise in the wild, the problem posed by such tasks is “where to look” to capture the explorations, trials, errors, and successes that eventually lead to the invention of superior performance. In this paper, we present several successful discoveries of methods for superior performance.

In line with child data, the mechanism shows early development of a noun category, and later development of a verb category. It is furthermore shown that the mechanism can maintain high performance at lower computational overhead by disregarding token frequency information, thus improving the plausibility of the mechanism as something that is used by language-learning children.",>Daniel Freudenthal>Julian Pine>Gary Jones>Fernand Gobet,>University of Liverpool>University of Liverpool>Nottingham Trent University>University of Liverpool,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0127/index.html

We asked parents to play with their 10-month-old infants with two novel toys for three minutes, every day for a week, teaching infants a novel word for one toy but not the other. After a week infants participated in a familiarization task in which they saw each object for 8 trials in silence, followed by a test trial consisting of both objects accompanied by the trained word. Infants exhibited a faster decline in looking times to the previously unlabeled object.

In the experiment, we controlled the time of presentation of a key fact that contradicts an initial explanation and has a central role in its reconstruction (bottom-up condition), reflective thinking (top-down condition), and the two together (bidirectional condition). The results are summarized as follows. First, when the prior explanation was rejected, attention to the key fact was inhibited although a new explanation was required. Second, the successful group increased their attention on the key fact just before the explanatory shift. Third, protection of the preceding explanation with unobserved facts was inhibited by guiding the participants’ attention toward the key fact. Finally, although the initial explanation was not completely shifted, a quasiexplanatory shift was achieved by activating reflective thinking with attention to the key fact.",>Hitoshi Terai>Kazuhisa Miwa>Naohiro Toyama,>Kindai University>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0129/index.html
2016,Gesture reveals spatial analogies during complex relational reasoning,"How do people think about complex relational phenomena like the behavior of the stock market? Here we hypothesize that people reason about such phenomena in part by creating spatial analogies, and we explore this possibility by examining people’s spontaneous gestures. Participants read a written lesson describing positive and negative feedback systems and then explained the key differences between them. Though the lesson was highly abstract and free of concrete imagery, participants produced spatial gestures in abundance during their explanations. These spatial gestures, despite being fundamentally abstract, showed clear regularities and often built off of each other to form larger spatial models of relational structure—that is, spatial analogies. Importantly, the spatial richness and systematicity revealed in participants’ gestures was largely divorced from spatial language. These results provide evidence for the spontaneous use of spatial analogy during complex relational reasoning.",>Kensy Cooperrider>Dedre Gentner>Susan Goldin-Meadow,">University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States>Northwestern University>University of Chicago",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0130/index.html
2016,What Determines Human Certainty?,"Previous work on concept learning has focused on how concepts are acquired, without addressing metacognitive aspects of this process. An important part of concept learning from a learner's perspective is knowing subjectively when a new concept has been effectively learned. Here, we investigate learners' certainty in a classic Boolean concept-learning task. We collected certainty judgements during the concept-learning task from 552 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We compare different models of certainty in order to determine exactly what learners' subjective certainty judgments encode. Our results suggest that learners' certainty is best explained by local accuracy rather than plausible alternatives such as total entropy or the maximum a posteriori hypothesis of an idealized Bayesian learner. This result suggests that certainty predominately reflects learners' performance and feedback, rather than any metacognition about the inferential task they are solving.",>Louis Marti>Steven Piantadosi>Francis Mollica>Celeste Kidd,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0131/index.html
2016,Moral Judgments: Studying People with Helping Professions,"While a considerable amount of research is done in the field of moral psychology, to our best knowledge, no systematic study of moral judgments made by professional groups who make moral decisions as part of their occupational duties exists (e.g. firefighters, medical doctors, midwives, police officers). By their training and practice, such professionals are expected to exhibit differences in moral judgment compared to the general population. Here we report data about moral judgments of firefighters and midwives using moral dilemmas in which one person must be sacrificed in order to save more people. The study reveals that midwives and firefighters are considerably less utilitarian compared to a control group of students. Midwives almost never find the utilitarian action to be permissible. This striking result demonstrates that further understanding of the specific mechanisms involved in special professional groups’ moral judgment is needed.",>Maurice Grinberg>Evgeniya Hristova>Veselina Kadreva,">New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Bulgaria>New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Bulgaria>New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Bulgaria",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0132/index.html
2016,Children consider others' expected costs and rewards when deciding what to teach,"Humans have an intuitive sense of how to help and inform others even in the absence of a specific request. How do we achieve this? Here we propose that even young children can reason about others’ expected costs and rewards to flexibly decide what is best for others. We asked children to choose one of two toys to teach to another agent while systematically varying the relative costs and rewards of discovering each toy’s functions. Children’s choices were consistent with the predictions of a computational model that maximizes others’ utilities by minimizing their expected costs and maximizing their expected rewards. These results suggest that even early in life, children draw rational inferences about others’ costs and benefits, and choose to communicate information that maximizes their utilities.",>Sophie Bridgers>Julian Jara-Ettinger>Hyowon Gweon,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, CA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0133/index.html
2016,Disfluency production in speech and gesture,"The cognitive architecture and function of co-speech gesture has been the subject of a large body of research. We investigate two main questions in this field, namely, whether language and gesture are the same or two inter-related systems, and whether gestures help resolve speech problems, by examining the relationship between gesture and disfluency in neurotypical speakers. Our results support the view of separate, but inter-related systems by showing that speech problems do not necessarily cause gesture problems, and on many occasions, gestures signal an upcoming speech problem even before it surfaces in overt speech. We also show that while gestures are more common on fluent trials, speakers use both iconic and beat gestures on disfluent trials to facilitate communication, although the two gesture types support communication in different ways.",>Niloofar Akhavan>Tilbe Goksun>Nazbanou Nozari,">Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey>Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0134/index.html

At the same time, humans often find themselves in situations where the categories of the objects they perceive are uncertain. How do people make predictions about unobserved features in such situations? We propose a rational model that solves this problem. Our model complements existing models in that it is applicable in settings where the conditional independence assumption does not hold (features are correlated within categories) and where the features are continuous as opposed to discrete.

We found that the three numeric competencies were associated with different anchoring tasks. SMap was associated with none of the three anchor tasks, while ONS consistently predicted stronger susceptibility to self-generated anchoring. The role of ONS and SNS in experimenter-given and valuation tasks were inconsistent. In Experiment 1, where the direction of adjustment from an anchor is specified, ONS and SNS were positively associated with anchor susceptibility in a valuation task, while they were not in an experimenter-given anchor task. On the other hand, in Experiment 2 where the direction of adjustment from an anchor is uncertain, ONS and SNS were positively associated with anchor susceptibility in an experimenter-given anchor task, while they were not in a valuation task.",>Sangsuk Yoon>Nathan Fong,>Temple University>Temple University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0136/index.html
2016,A perspective on all cognition? A study of everyday environments from the perspective of distributed cognition,"Distributed cognition is a perspective that primarily has been applied to complex socio-technical systems such as flight decks of commercial airliners, or operating rooms where professionals perform cognitive tasks in environments specifically designed for this. For some scholars distributed cognition is exactly this kind of specialized cognitive system. On the other hand it has been claimed by some workers in the field that distributed cognition is not a kind of cognition but a perspective on all cognition. We have therefore studied an environment very different from the systems previously studied, namely single people’s homes. We find that there are many similarities between the home and the specialized socio-technical environments. To us this suggests that the specially designed complex environments can be seen as specialized cases of the general principles of distributed cognition which are not reflections of “particular work practices” but of general features of human cognition.",>Nils Dahlbäck>Mattias Kristiansson,>Linköping University>Linköping University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0137/index.html
2016,Temporal Structure Modulates ERP Correlates of Visual Sequential Learning,"Sequential learning (SL) refers to the ability to learn the temporal and ordinal patterns of one’s environment. The current study examines the effects of synchronous and asynchronous temporal patterns on visual sequential learning. We hypothesize that entrainment allows for better processing of the ordinal structure of sequential events. Twenty healthy adult participants performed two versions (synchronous and asynchronous) of a visual sequential learning paradigm while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Reaction time data demonstrated that learning occurred in both temporal conditions. On the other hand, the mean ERP amplitudes between 350 and 750ms post-predictor onset in the posterior regions of interest revealed that learning of the statistical contingencies between stimuli was disrupted for the asynchronous temporal condition but intact for the synchronous condition. These neurophysiological data suggest that the brain processes regular and irregular timing events differently, with statistical learning of ordinal patterns being improved by a synchronous temporal structure.",>Kimberly Ross>Christopher Conway,">Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA>Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0138/index.html
2016,Knowledge and use of price distributions by populations and individuals,"How much do individuals, compared to the population, know about the distribution of values in the world? Participants reported the prices of consumer goods such as watches and belts and we compared how accurately individuals vs. the overall population knew the mean and dispersion of prices. Although individuals and the population both knew objects’ average prices and relative standard deviations, the population was more sensitive to the absolute standard deviation of prices. In a second experiment, we examined whether individuals’ impoverished distribution knowledge impairs their ability to interpret advertisements. Consistent with people using Bayesian inference, the higher an object’s actual price dispersion, the more participants relied on advertisements; however, this effect is considerably smaller than a simple proportional offset, suggesting again that individuals underestimate dispersion. Thus, despite having a sense of the distribution of real world quantities, individuals tend to know only a fraction of the world distribution.",>Timothy Lew>Edward Vul,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0139/index.html
2016,A Unified Framework for Bounded and Unbounded Numerical Estimation,"Representations of numerical value have been assessed using bounded (e.g., 0-1000) and unbounded (e.g., 0-?) number-line tasks, with considerable debate regarding whether one or both tasks elicit unique cognitive strategies (e.g., addition or subtraction) and require unique cognitive models. To test this, we examined 86 5- to 9-year-olds' addition, subtraction, and estimation skill (bounded and unbounded). Against the measurement-skills hypothesis, estimates were even more logarithmic on unbounded than bounded number lines and were better described by conventional log-linear models than by alternative cognitive models. Moreover, logarithmic index values reliably predicted arithmetic scores, whereas model parameters of alternative models failed to do so. Results suggest that the logarithmic-to-linear shift theory provides a unified framework for numerical estimation with high descriptive adequacy and yields uniquely accurate predictions for children’s early math proficiency.",>Dan Kim>John Opfer,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0140/index.html

Two experiments tested a hypothesis that people focus on events in which the target cause changes and all other factors remain stable. In both four-cause (Experiment 1) and eight-cause (Experiment 2) scenarios, participants learned causal relations more accurately when they viewed datasets in which only one cause changed at a time. However, participants in the comparison condition, in which multiple causes changed simultaneously, performed fairly well; in addition to focusing on events when a single cause changed, they also used events in which multiple causes changed for updating their beliefs about causal strength. These findings help explain how people are able to learn causal relations in situations when there are many alternative factors.",>Cory Derringer>Benjamin Rottman,">University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0141/index.html

2016,The Relationship Between Inhibitory Control and Free Will Beliefs in 4-to 6-Year-Old-Children,"This study explores the relationship between beliefs about self-control and the ability to exercise self-control in 4- to 6- year-old children. Sixty-eight children were asked a series of questions to gauge whether they believed that they could freely choose to act against their desires or inhibit themselves from performing desired actions. Children were also asked to provide qualitative explanations for why they could or could not exercise free will, and to complete two inhibitory control tasks: forbidden toy and day/night. Choice responses were negatively correlated with performance on the forbidden toy task, when children performed that task first. There was also a negative correlation between a belief in an internal locus of control, and success on the forbidden toy measure. Refraining from touching a forbidden toy appears to be correlated to less belief in free will.

2016,Explanatory Biases in Social Categorization,"Stereotypes are important simplifying assumptions we use for navigating the social world, associating traits with social categories. These beliefs can be used to infer an individual’s likely social category from observed traits (a diagnostic inference) or to make inferences about an individual’s unknown traits based on their putative social category (a predictive inference). We argue that these inferences rely on the same explanatory logic as other sorts of diagnostic and predictive reasoning tasks, such as causal explanation. Supporting this conclusion, we demonstrate that stereotype use involves four of the same biases known to be used in causal explanation: A bias against categories making unverified predictions (Exp. 1), a bias toward simple categories (Exp. 2), an asymmetry between confirmed and disconfirmed predictions of potential categories (Exp. 3), and a tendency to treat uncertain categorizations as certainly true or false (Exp. 4).",>Samuel Johnson>Haylie Kim>Frank Keil,">Yale University, New Haven, CT>University of California - Berkeley, Berkeley, CA>Yale University, New Haven, CT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0144/index.html

We asked whether children adapt their event descriptions depending on (a) the typicality of event components, and (b) the listener’s visual access to the events. We found that children’s ability to use information about the listener’s visual perspective to make specific adjustments to event descriptions emerged only in highly interactive contexts, in which participants collaborated towards mutual goals.",>Myrto Grigoroglou>Anna Papafragou,>University of Delaware>University of Delaware,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0145/index.html

Our hypothesis is that a limited set of primary metaphors and image schemas underlies a wide range of gestures. Our analysis of a video corpus supports this view: over 90% of the gestures in the corpus are structured by image schemas via a limited set of primary metaphors.

In the field of practice, instructors teach learners how to maintain balance on a swinging flat belt (slackline), such as by moving their hands in parallel. We hypothesized that bimanual coordination in the horizontal direction might contribute to dynamic balancing on a slackline. In our pilot study, two participants at different skill levels were asked to maintain their balance on a slackline as long as possible. The dynamic stability of bimanual coordination was assessed by a nonlinear time series analysis (cross recurrence quantification analysis), then compared among the participants. Bimanual coordination stability was higher in the experienced player than in the novice player. The results suggest that the single-leg standing skill might be correlated with bimanual coordination stability.

We propose that distal causes are only perceived to be explanatory if the causal mechanism is insensitive to inessential variations of boundary conditions. In two experiments, subjects first observed deterministic A->B->C relationships in a single exemplar of an unknown kind. They judged A to be crucial for C by default. However, when they subsequently learned that the causal mechanism fails to generate the A->C dependency in other exemplars of the same kind, subjects devalued A as a crucial explanation for C even within the first exemplar. We relate these findings to the idea that good explanations pick out portable dependency relations, and that sensitive causes fail to meet this requirement.",>Jonas Nagel>Simon Stephan,">University of Göttingen, Germany>University of Göttingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0149/index.html
2016,The Variable Relationship Between On-Task Behavior and Learning,"The Time-on-Task hypothesis asserts that learning is a function of time one allocates to a learning task. Thus, time off-task reduces learning opportunities and is therefore thought to be detrimental to learning. To date, the available research suggests a positive relationship between time on-task and achievement; however, the strength of the correlation fluctuates dramatically. One potential explanation that has been put forth to account for the mixed results is differences in the operational definition of time. The present study tests this hypothesis by examining whether a more stable relationship between on-task behavior and learning can be obtained if time is operationalized in a uniform way. The results of the present study indicate that while on-task behavior was positively correlated with learning outcomes overall, marked variability was still found across classrooms suggesting that the divergent results obtained in previous research are not driven solely by differences in how time is measured.",>Karrie Godwin>Howard Seltman>Ma.

The present study investigates two factors in an experimental setting: (1) groups with a single opposing perspective (maverick) would hold an advantage over groups and (2) groups with positive moods would hold an advantage over groups with negativity. We investigate the factors influencing perspective taking in problem-solving groups using conversational agents.

The available evidence with children and adults, however, suggests that the mechanism or set of mechanisms that underpins causal perception and causal reasoning are not well understood; that is, it is unclear whether causal perception and causal reasoning are underpinned by a Bayesian mechanism, associative mechanism, or both. It has been suggested that a Bayesian mechanism, rather than an associative mechanism, underpins causal reasoning because such a mechanism can better explain the putative backward-blocking finding in children and adults (e.g., Sobel, Tenenbaum, & Gopnik, 2004). In this paper, we report two experiments to examine to what extent infants and adults exhibit backward blocking and whether humans’ ability to reason about causal events is underpinned by an associative mechanism, a Bayesian mechanism, or both.",>Deon Benton>David Rakison,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0153/index.html

Although generics are pervasive in natural language, there is no unique linguistic marker of genericity, making the identification of generics a challenge. We investigate the morphosyntactic cues that listeners use to identify whether a sentence should receive a generic interpretation or not. We find that two factors – the definiteness of a sentence’s subject NP and the tense of the sentence – are extremely important in guiding intuitions about whether a sentence should receive a generic interpretation. We argue that the importance of these factors can be explained by taking generic interpretations to arise due to a failure to ground expressions as referring to specific entities or events.",>Philip Crone>Mike Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0155/index.html

However, previous research investigating inhibitory control in older adults has not evaluated the extent to which irrelevant information is processed and later recognized. Using a dual task paradigm with young adults, Dewald, Sinnett, and Doumas (2011) demonstrated inhibited recognition for previously ignored words, provided they had appeared infrequently with targets in the primary task, compared to words that did not appear with targets. The current study adapted this paradigm to examine inhibitory mechanisms in a sample of older adults. Here, older adults exhibited inhibited recognition for all words while young adults continued to show greater inhibition for words that had appeared with targets compared to words that had not.

The present study investigated the neural correlates of these two patterns through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A more holistic pattern was associated with more activation in the face-selective perceptual areas, including the occipital face area and fusiform face area. In contrast, participants using a more analytic pattern demonstrated more activation in areas important for top-down control of visual attention, including the frontal eye field and intraparietal sulcus. In addition, participants using the analytic strategy had better recognition performance than those showing holistic patterns. These results suggest that analytic eye movement patterns are associated with more engagement of top-down control of visual attention, which may consequently enhance recognition performance.",>Cynthia Y.

Most social robots currently being used are light-weight and much smaller in size compared to people. In this work, we investigate designing interactions for larger and more physically capable robots as they have more potential to assist people physically. A modified version of Baxter robot was used, by sitting Baxter on top of an electronic wheelchair. Two experiments were designed for studying the role of facial expressions and body movements in establishing trust with the user and for expressing attitudes.

Here, the results of a novel behavioral task are offered as an additional challenge for these approaches. Participants were presented with a familiar analogy problem (A:B::C:?), but with a twist. Each of the possible completions (D1, D2, D3), could be considered valid: There was no unambiguously “correct” answer, but an array of equally good candidates. We find that participants’ recent experience categorizing objects (i.e., manipulating the salience of the features), systematically affected performance in the ambiguous analogy task. The results are consistent with a dynamic, context sensitive approach to modeling analogy that continuously updates feature weights over the course of experience.",>Paul Thibodeau>David Myers>Stephen Flusberg,>Oberlin College>Oberlin College>Purchase College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0159/index.html

Recent adult studies have revealed better memory for trivia facts that elicit more curiosity. The current study modifies the methods used in previous adult studies in order to make them more appropriate for children.

2016,The Effects of Discourse Cues on Garden Path Processing,"We report a self-paced reading study that investigated garden-path sentences like While the man hunted {a/the} deer ran into the woods. In such sentences, the critical noun (deer) tends to be misparsed as an object of the preceding verb, and has to be re-analyzed as a subject of the following clause when the disambiguating verb (e.g. ran) is encountered. We build on earlier corpus work which found a relationship between syntactic function and information status: Subjects tend to be already-mentioned information/definite, while objects are typically new/indefinite. We investigated whether the noun’s information status influences processing and whether this effect depends on the verb’s argument structure. Results showed that information status matters when processing the noun after optionally transitive verbs (hunt) but not after reflexive absolute verbs (wash). These results suggest that access to discourse-level representations during noun phrase re-analysis is modulated by verb argument structure.",>Ana Besserman>Elsi Kaiser,">University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA>University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0161/index.html
2016,Children’s Use of Orthographic Cues in Language Processing,"This study investigated factors responsible for the developmental discontinuity of children's language processing in Japanese. We conducted an experiment using cross-modal linguistic stimuli (prosody & orthography) to see whether children’s orthographic knowledge affects their rendaku strategy or not. Our results showed that orthographic cues affected literate children’s rendaku processing. They were aware the correspondence between types of orthography and word categories in Japanese. Children define the rendaku category and redefine it, resulting in the qualitative change in children’s rendaku strategies.",>Takayo Sugimoto,">Aichi University, 1-1 Machihatakemachi, Toyohashi, 441-8522 Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0162/index.html
2016,Modeling language discrimination in infants using i-vector representations,"Experimental research suggests that at birth infants can discriminate two languages if they belong to different rhythmic classes, and by 4 months of age they can discriminate two languages within the same class provided they have been previously exposed to at least one of them. In this paper, we present a novel application of speech technology tools to model language discrimination, which may help to understand how infants achieve high performance on this task. By combining a Gaussian Mixture Model of the acoustic space and low-dimensional representations of novel utterances with a model of a habituation paradigm, we show that brief exposure to French does not allow to discriminate between two previously unheard languages with similar phonological properties, but facilitates discrimination of two phonologically distant languages. The implications of these findings are discussed.",>M. Julia Carbajal>Radek Fér>Emmanuel Dupoux,">Laboratoire de Sc.

Evidence on Trust, Advice, and Risk Taking in Delegated Asset Management","We test the effects of advice and trust on risk-taking in three online experiments designed to elucidate under what conditions financial advice may increase risk-taking, irrespective of advisor performance. In our study, investors made 100 decisions, selecting between one of two alternatives: risky or conservative. We manipulate the suggestion of an advisor (risky vs. non-risky investments), the fee of the advice, as well as the trustworthiness of the advisor (by increasing the transparency of the advice presented) to test the effect of the advice on risk-taking. The results show that individuals asymmetrically follow the advice they received, with a bias towards following more risky than conservative advice.

2016,A Recurrent Network Approach to Modeling Linguistic Interaction,"What capacities enable linguistic interactions? While several proposals have been advanced, little progress has been made in comparing and articulating them within an integrative framework. In this paper, we take initial steps towards a connectionist framework designed to compare different cognitive models of social interactions. The framework we propose couples two simple-recurrent network systems (Chang, 2002) to explore the computational underpinnings of interaction, and apply this modeling framework to predict the semantic structure derived from transcripts of an experimental joint decision task (Bahrami et al., 2010; Fusaroli et al., 2012). In an exploratory application of this framework, we find (i) that the coupled network approach is capable of learning from noisy naturalistic input but (ii) that integration of production and comprehension does not increase the network performance. We end by discussing the value of looking to traditional parallel distributed processing as flexible models for exploring computational mechanisms of conversation.",>Rick Dale>Riccardo Fusaroli>Kristian Tylén>Joanna Rączaszek-Leonardi>Morten Christiansen,">University of California, Merced>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS)>Cornell University and Aarhus University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0165/index.html
2016,The Aging Lexicon: Differences in the Semantic Networks of Younger and Older Adults,"How does the mental lexicon, the network of learned words in our semantic memory, change in old age? To address this question, we employ a new network inference method to infer networks from verbal fluency data of a group of younger and older adults. We find that older adults produce more unique words in verbal fluency tasks than younger adults. In line with recent theorizing, this suggests a larger mental lexicon for older than for younger adults. Moreover, we find that relative to the mental lexicon of younger adults, the mental lexicon of older adults is less small-world-like. Based on several findings linking network clustering to processing speed, this finding suggests that not only the size, but also the structure of the mental lexicon may contribute to apparent cognitive decline in old age.",>Dirk U.

Awareness of one’s lexicon may encourage word learning if children pay more attention to the definition of unknown words. Here, we tested 3-4-year-old children (N = 91) on a word learning task embedded in an e-book. When a novel word was read, children were either asked if they knew the word, asked a question about the storyline, or asked no question. Then they were given a description without visual input and asked to identify the referent’s picture from three choices. Participants who were asked if they knew a word before being provided with the definition identified more referents than children in the other conditions.

2016,Collective search on rugged landscapes: A cross-environmental analysis,"In groups and organizations, agents use both individual and social learning to solve problems. The balance between these two activities can lead collectives to very different levels of performance. We model collective search as a combination of simple learning strategies to conduct the first large-scale comparative study, across fifteen challenging environments and two different network structures. In line with previous findings in the social learning literature, collectives using a hybrid of individual and social learning perform much better than specialists using only one or the other. Importantly, we find that collective performance varies considerably across different task environments, and that different types of network structures can be superior, depending on the environment. These results suggest that recent contradictions in the social learning literature may be due to methodological differences between two separate research traditions, studying disjoint sets of environments that lead to divergent findings.",>Daniel Barkoczi>Pantelis Pipergias Analytis>Charley Wu,">Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0168/index.html

Prosocial and selective perspective taking in four-year-olds","To successfully navigate the complex social world, people often need to solve the problem of perspective selection: Between two conflicting viewpoints of the self and the other, whose perspective should one take? In two experiments, we show that four-year-olds use others’ knowledge and goals to decide when to engage in visual perspective taking. Children were more likely to take a social partner’s perspective to describe an ambiguous symbol when she did not know numbers and wanted to learn than when she knew numbers and wanted to teach. These results were shown in children’s own responses (Experiment 1) and in their evaluations of others’ responses (Experiment 2). By preschool years, children understand when perspective taking is appropriate and necessary and selectively take others’ perspectives in social interactions. These results provide novel insights into the nature and the development of perspective taking.",>Xuan Zhao>Bertram F.

We prepared five types of monaural auditory displays consisting of triangle wave sounds and conducted an experiment to investigate which kinds of displays succeeded in conveying the four pieces of information to participants. As a result, we could confirm that one of the prepared monaural auditory displays, designed as a “progress bar” on the basis of the mental-number line and spatial-number association of the response code effect, succeeded in conveying the four pieces of information more effectively compared with the other candidate sets (its average correct rates were 0.88). This result thus strongly shows that this monaural auditory display was quite useful for conveying primitive spatial information to users.",>Takanori Komatsu>Seiji Yamada,">Meiji University, Tokyo, Japan>National Institute of Informatics",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0170/index.html
2016,Spatial Attention to Social Cues is not a Monolithic Process,"Social stimuli are a highly salient source of information, and seem to possess unique qualities that set them apart from other well-known categories. One characteristic is their ability to elicit spatial orienting, whereby directional stimuli like eye-gaze and pointing gestures act as exogenous cues that trigger automatic shifts of attention that are difficult to inhibit. This effect has been extended to non-social stimuli, like arrows, leading to some uncertainty regarding whether spatial orienting is specialized for social cues. Using a standard spatial cueing paradigm, we found evidence that both a pointing hand and arrow are effective cues, but that the hand is encoded more quickly, leading to overall faster responses. We then extended the paradigm to include multiple cues in order to evaluate congruent vs. incongruent cues. Our results indicate that faster encoding of the social cue leads to downstream effects on the allocation of attention resulting in faster orienting.",>Samuel Harding>Ty Boyer>Bennett Bertenthal,>Indiana University>Georgia Southern University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0171/index.html
2016,When High WMC Promotes Mental Set: A Model of the Water Jar Task,"Differences in working memory capacity (WMC) relate to performance on a variety of problem solving tasks. High WMC is beneficial for solving analytical problems, but can hinder performance on insight problems (DeCaro & Beilock, 2010). One suggested reason for WMC-related differences in problem solving performance is differences in strategy selection, in which high WMC individuals tend toward complex algorithmic strategies (Engle, 2002). High WMC might increase the likelihood of non-optimal performance on Luchins’ (1942) water jar task because high WMC solvers tend toward longer solutions, not noticing when shorter solutions become available. We present empirical data showing this effect, and a computational model that replicates the findings by choosing among problem solving strategies with different WM demands. The high WMC model used a memory-intensive strategy, which led to long solutions when shorter ones were available. The low WMC model was unable to use that strategy, and switched to shorter solutions.",>Erin Sovansky>Stellan Ohlsson,>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0172/index.html
2016,Thermodynamics and Cognition: Towards a Lawful Explanation of the Mind,"An argument is developed to show that the theoretical methods of description for biological and physical systems can be corroborated by appealing to the second law of thermodynamics. The separation dates back to Modern western philosophy, but we show that the second law’s influence on the evolutionary history of life at the scale of the global Earth system—a system that has demonstrated an exponential increase of entropy production over time— justifies rescinding this separation. From this perspective it appears that the necessity of ever increasing entropy in nature may constrain the organization and behavior of living organisms and cognitive processes. We suggest a new framework for understanding cognition by explaining memory at the scale of the brain-body-environment system with respect to its role in increasing entropy in nature. This framework, if developed further, may lead to a fruitful understanding of cognition by appealing to the necessity of physical laws.",>Larry Moralez>Luis Favela,>University of Central Florida>University of Central Florida,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0173/index.html

2016,Our morals really depends on our language: The foreign language effect within participants,"Recent research has suggested that using a foreign language to present hypothetical moral dilemmas increases the rate of utilitarian judgments about those dilemmas (e.g., Greene et al, 2001) and decreases incoherency between judgments in framing effect tasks (e.g., Costa, Foucart, Hayakawa, Aparici, Apesteguia, Heafner, & Keysar, 2014; Keysar, Hayakawa, & An, 2012). However, existing research has mainly investigated this effect using between-participants designs (i.e., different participants in the foreign and native language conditions). Such designs are unable to exclude non-equivalent conditions as a confounding variable. In contrast, this study examined the foreign language effect using a within-subjects design (i.e., all participants responded to moral dilemmas (Greene et al, 2001) and framing effect tasks in both their native and foreign languages. The “foreign language effect” was replicated, excluding semantic non-equivalence between language conditions as a potential confound.

In this study, we directly contrast two tasks with different goals: identification and instruction giving. Speakers had to refer to a target building nearby or further away, so that their addressee would distinguish it between other buildings (identification) or give route directions and use the same building as a landmark (instructions). Our results showed that irrespective of goals, the referring expressions consisted of the same types of attributes, yet the attribute frequency and formulation differed. In the identification task, references were longer, contained more locative and more post-nominal modifiers. In addition, referential choices were influenced by the visual distance between the speaker and the target: when the speaker observed the target from far, references were longer and contained more often locative modifiers.",>Adriana Alexandra Baltaretu>Emiel Krahmer>Alfons Maes,">TiCC, Tilburg University, Tilburg, Noord Brabant, The Netherlands>TiCC,Tilburg University, Tilburg, Noord Brabant, The Netherlands>TiCC,Tilburg University, Tilburg, Noord Brabant, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0178/index.html
2016,Statistical learning creates novel object associations via transitive relations,"A remarkable ability of the cognitive system is the creation of new knowledge based on prior experiences. What cognitive mechanisms support such knowledge creation? We propose that statistical learning not only extracts existing relationships between objects, but also generates new associations between objects that have never been directly associated. Participants viewed a continuous color sequence consisting of base pairs (e.g., A-B, B-C), and learned these pairs. Importantly, they also successfully learned a novel pair (A-C) that could only be associated through transitive relations between the base pairs (Exp1). This learning, however, was not successful with three base pairs (e.g., learning A-D from A-B, B-C, C-D), revealing a limit in this transitive process (Exp2). Beyond temporal associations, novel transitive associations can also be formed across categorical hierarchies (Exp3), but with limits (Exp4&5). The current findings suggest that statistical learning provides an efficient scaffold through which new object associations are transitively created.",>Yu Luo>Jiaying Zhao,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0179/index.html

We investigated the effect of patch distribution (depleting or non-depleting) and ability to return to previously searched patches on participants’ decision to switch from one patch to another while searching. Whether or not a participant could return after leaving a patch led to fewer samples and fewer relevant items found. Whether or not the patches depleted and whether it was possible to return to a patch influenced stopping rules, indicating that these factors may alter the size of the increment applied through the Incremental Rule.",>Amber Bloomfield>J.

The correlation between the causes in the data was either positive, zero, or negative. The data was judged as most likely in the positive condition and least likely in the negative condition, a finding that obtained even though all other statistical properties of the data (e.g., causal strengths, outcome density) were controlled.

Whether or not estimations of integers plays a role in probability judgments has yet to be investigated. In the present study we use data from two adult experiments as well as results from comparisons of two computational models to argue that simple probability judgments based on proportion may involve a division operation, a finding that could explain why previous research has yielded little evidence supporting the role of the ANS in probability judgments.",>Shaun O'Grady>Tom Griffiths>Fei Xu,">University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CALIFORNIA, United States>University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CALIFORNIA, United States>University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CALIFORNIA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0183/index.html
2016,Social Affordance Tracking over Time - A Sensorimotor Account of False-Belief Tasks,"False-belief task have mainly been associated with the explanatory notion of the theory of mind. However, it has often been pointed out that this kind of high-level reasoning is computational and time expensive. Viewed from an embodied intelligence perspective, the failing in a false-belief test can be the result of the impairment to recognize and track others' sensorimotor contingencies and affordances. Thus, social cognition is explained in terms of low-level signals instead of high-level reasoning. In this work, we present a generative model for optimal action selection which simultaneously can be employed to make predictions of others' actions. We demonstrate how the tracking of others' sensorimotor signals can give rise to correct false-belief inferences, while a lack thereof leads to failing. With this work, we want to emphasize the importance of sensorimotor contingencies in social cognition, which might be a key to artificial, socially intelligent systems.",>Judith Bütepage>Hedvig Kjellström>Danica Kragic,">CVAP, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden>CVAP, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden>CVAP, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0184/index.html

The illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) exemplifies these failures: people believe they understand the world more deeply than they actually do and only realize that this belief is an illusion when they attempt to explain elements of the world. An unexplored factor of the IOED is how people may become overconfident by confusing their own understanding with others’ understanding. In two experiments, we examine the IOED in mental disorders, a domain where society has a limited understanding. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that people display an IOED for mental disorders as well as devices, but that it is smaller for mental disorders.

The speech perception literature offers examples of disruption of comprehension for unfamiliar speech and also of listeners’ rapid accommodation to unfamiliar accents. Much of this research uses a single measure and/or focuses on isolated word perception. We investigated listeners’ abilities to comprehend and shadow connected speech spoken in a familiar or unfamiliar accent. We found increases in shadowing latencies and comprehension errors in the Dissimilar Speech relative to Similar Speech conditions—especially for relatively informal rather than more academic style speech. Additionally, there was less accommodation over time to Dissimilar than Similar Speech. These results suggest that there are costs both in the immediate timescale of processing speech (necessary for shadowing) and in the longer time scale of listening comprehension when accent and other speech quality is very different from one’s own speech.",>Lynn Perry>Emily Mech>Maryellen MacDonald>Mark Seidenberg,">University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States>University of Wisconsin Madison>University of Wisconsin Madison>University of Wisconsin Madison",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0186/index.html

2016,Structural Alignment in Incidental Word Learning,"Young children can sometimes acquire new vocabulary words with only limited, indirect exposure (Carey & Bartlett, 1978). We propose that structural alignment processes lead to fluent detection of commonalities and differences that facilitate incidental word learning. To test this, we adapted the Carey and Bartlett paradigm, varying the alignability of the objects that 4-year-olds saw while hearing the novel word chromium. In Experiment 1, children in the High-Alignment condition were significantly better than those in the Low-Alignment condition at identifying chromium objects in a subsequent task. In Experiment 2, we ruled out an alternative account by equalizing the overall amount of information presented to the two groups. We also found that the advantage of high alignment persisted after two-to-four days. These results suggest that structural alignment is a mechanism by which children can learn word meanings even in incidental word learning situations.",>Ruxue Shao>Dedre Gentner,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0188/index.html
2016,Reflexive Spatial Attention to Goal Directed Reaching,"Social interaction involves cues such as gaze direction, head orientation, and pointing gestures that serve to automatically orient attention to a specific referent or spatial location. In this paper we demonstrate that an observed reaching action similarly results in a reflexive shift in attention as evidenced by faster responses that are congruent with the direction of the reach, than responses that are incongruent. When the task involves a saccadic response (Experiment 1) this prediction is inhibited and results in a reverse-congruence, faster responses to incongruent than congruent cues, when the cue occurs after the reach is completed. This reverse-congruence is not present when the task involves a key press (Experiment 2) or a mouse movement (Experiment 3). We propose that the inhibition of the predictive saccade is overcome when the eye movements toward the goal are activated to guide the mouse movement.",>Alexis Barton>Bennett Bertenthal>Samuel Harding,">Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States>Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States>Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0189/index.html

The study focuses on individual learners, tracking their learning trajectories through their writings in the EF-Cambridge Open Language Database (EFCAMDAT), an open access learner corpus. We draw from 17,859 writings by 1,280 learners and ask whether article accuracy in individual learners fluctuates randomly or whether learners can be clustered according to their developmental trajectories. In particular, we apply k-means clustering to automatically cluster in a bottom up fashion learners with similar learning curves. We follow learners for a period covering one CEFR level. Given the relatively short learning window, the majority of learners follow a horizontal line. Nevertheless, we also identify groups of learners showing a power-function and U-shaped curve.

2016,Spatializing emotion: A mapping of valence or magnitude?,"People implicitly associate different emotions with different locations in left-right space. Which dimensions of emotion do they spatialize? Across many studies people spatialize emotional valence, mapping positive emotions onto their dominant side of space and negative emotions onto their non-dominant side. Yet, other results suggest a contradictory mapping of emotional intensity (a.k.a., emotional magnitude), according to which people associate more intense emotions with the right and less intense emotions with the left, regardless of valence. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we first tested whether people implicitly spatialize whichever dimension of emotion they attend to. Results showed the predicted valence mapping, but no intensity mapping. We then tested an alternative explanation of findings previously interpreted as showing an intensity mapping; these data may reflect a left-right mapping of spatial magnitude, not emotion. People implicitly spatialize emotional valence, but there is no clear evidence for an implicit lateral mapping of emotional intensity.",>Benjamin Pitt>Daniel Casasanto,>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0191/index.html

Some words are lexically suggestive regarding the taxonomic position of their referent (e.g., bumblebee, starfish). However, this information differs from language to language (e.g., in Dutch the equivalent words hold no taxonomic information: hommel, vlinder). Three language groups, Dutch, English, and Indonesian speakers, were tested in similarity and typicality judgment tasks.

2016,"A Developmental Shift in the Relationship Between Sequential Learning, Executive Function, and Language Ability as Revealed by Event-Related Potentials","Previous research has shown a link between sequential learning (SL) and language as well as links between executive function (EF) and both language and SL. However, little research has focused on both the development of the relationship between these factors and their neurological underpinnings. Here we report a study of the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of SL and behavioral measures of language and EF in a sample of 7-12-year-old children. Results revealed that both SL and EF had independent associations with language development but that the contribution that both made toward language development shifted dramatically between the ages of 7 to 11-12 years. The results furthermore suggest that this developmental shift may be due in part to the maturation of EF abilities and changes due to neural entrenchment and commitment as a consequence of language acquisition.",>Joanne Deocampo>Christopher Conway,">Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States>Georgia State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0194/index.html
2016,Ambiguity and Representational Stability: What is the role of embodied experiences?,"The influence of embodied experiences on cognition is not yet fully understood. To explore its effects, we analyzed the responses of adults in a high-ambiguity prediction task: Adults had to decide which of two objects would sink faster (or slower) in water. Ambiguity was achieved by pitting object volume and object mass against buoyancy: The winning object was sometimes heavy and big, and sometimes it was light and small. Thus, the task could not be solved with a simplistic rule alone. The crucial manipulation was whether adults haptically explored the objects, either prior to feedback training or afterward. Findings showed a clear disadvantage of hands-on experiences: When allowed to hold the objects, participants were likely to show a simplistic focus on object heaviness. These results call for a more a nuanced understanding of the effect of embodied experiences on the stability of representations.",>Ramon D.

2016,Questions in informal teaching: A study of mother-child conversations,"Questioning is a core component of formal pedagogy. Parents commonly question children, but do they use questions to teach? Research has shown that informal pedagogical situations elicit stronger inferences than the same evidence observed in non-pedagogical situations. Certain questions (“pedagogical questions”) have similar features. We investigate the frequency and distribution of pedagogical questions from mother-child conversations documented in the CHILDES database. We show that pedagogical questions are commonplace, are more frequent for middle-class mothers compared to working-class mothers, are more frequent during free play than during daily routines, and are more frequent in mothers who ask more questions. The results serve as a first step towards understanding the role of questions in informal pedagogy.",>Yue Yu>Elizabeth Bonawitz>Patrick Shafto,>Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0196/index.html
2016,Comparing Predictive and Co-occurrence Based Models of Lexical Semantics Trained on Child-directed Speech,"Distributional Semantic Models have been successful at predicting many semantic behaviors. The aim of this paper is to compare two major classes of these models – co-occurrence-based models, and prediction error-driven models – in learning semantic categories from child-directed speech. Co-occurrence models have gained more attention in cognitive research, while research from computational linguistics on big datasets has found more success with prediction-based models. We explore differences between these types of lexical semantic models (as representatives of Hebbian vs. reinforcement learning mechanisms, respectively) within a more cognitively relevant context: the acquisition of semantic categories (e.g., apple and orange as fruit vs. soap and shampoo as bathroom items) from linguistic data available to children. We found that models that perform some form of abstraction outperform those that do not, and that co-occurrence-based abstraction models performed the best. However, different models excel at different categories, providing evidence for complementary learning systems.",>Fatemeh Torabi Asr>Jon Willits>Michael Jones,">Indiana University>University of California, Riverside>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0197/index.html
2016,Geometric representations of evidence in models of decision-making,"Traditionally, models of the decision-making process have focused on the case where a decision-maker must choose between two alternatives. The most successful of these, sequential sampling models, have been extended from the binary case to account for choices and response times between multiple alternatives. In this paper, I present a geometric representation of diffusion and accumulator models of multiple-choice decisions, and show how these can be analyzed as Markov processes on lattices. I then introduce psychological relationships between choice alternatives and show how this impacts the sequential sampling process. I conclude with two examples showing how one can predict distributions of responses on a continuum as well as response times by incorporating psychological representations into a multi-dimensional random walk diffusion process.",>Peter Kvam,">Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0198/index.html
2016,Centering and the meaning of conditionals,"The centering inference - p & q, therefore if p then q - is important in reasoning research because it is logically valid for some accounts of conditionals (e. g. the material and the probability conditionals), but not for others (e. g. the inferential conditional, according to which a conditional is true if and only if there is an inferential connection between p and q). We tested participants' acceptance of centering compared to valid and invalid inferences not containing conditionals, varying the presence of an inferential connection and of a common topic of discourse between p and q. Participants' acceptance of centering was more similar to valid inferences than to invalid inferences, and there was no reliable effect of a connection between p and q. Acceptance rates were higher when there was a common topic of discourse, independently of the type of inference. The findings support the probability conditional account.",>Nicole Cruz>David Over>Mike Oaksford>Jean Baratgin,">EPHE, Paris, France; Birkbeck, University of London, UK>Durham University, UK>Birkbeck, University of London, UK>Paris 8 University, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0199/index.html
2016,A rational speech-act model of projective content,"Certain content of a linguistic construction can project when the construction is embedded in entailment-canceling environments. For example, the conclusion that John smoked in the past from ""John stopped smoking"" still holds for ""John didn't stop smoking,"" where the original utterance is embedded under negation. There are two main approaches to account for projection. The semantic approach adds restrictions of the common ground to the conventional meaning. The pragmatic approach tries to derive projection from general conversational principles. In this paper we build a probabilistic model of language understanding in which the listener jointly infers the world state and the common ground the speaker has assumed. We take change-of-state verbs as an example and model its projective content under negation. Under certain assumptions, the model correctly predicts the projective behavior and its interaction with the question under discussion, without any special semantic treatment of projective content.",>Ciyang Qing>Noah Goodman>Daniel Lassiter,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0200/index.html

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a fundamental role in context dependent behaviour. We model the PFC at the level of single spiking neurons, to explore the underlying computations which determine its contextual responses. The model is built using the Neural Engineering Framework and performs input selection and integration as a nonlinear recurrent dynamical process. The results obtained from the model closely match behavioural and neural experimental data obtained from macaque monkeys that are trained to perform a context sensitive perceptual decision task. The close match suggests that the low-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical model we suggest captures central aspects of context dependent decision making in primates.",>Sugandha Sharma>Brent Komer>Terrence Stewart>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0202/index.html

The texts of published research articles from these investigations are the focus of a discourse analysis described in the present article. The results of the discourse analysis suggest that claims about what a person knows are actually generalized descriptions of behavior.

These situations sometimes require us to avoid certain outcomes at all cost, for example because they are poisonous, harmful, or otherwise dangerous. We test participants' behavior in scenarios in which they have to find the optimum of a function while at the same time avoid outputs below a certain threshold. In two experiments, we find that Safe-Optimization, a Gaussian Process-based exploration-exploitation algorithm, describes participants' behavior well and that participants seem to care firstly whether a point is safe and then try to pick the optimal point from all such safe points. This means that their trade-off between exploration and exploitation can be seen as an intelligent, approximate, and homeostasis-driven strategy.",>Eric Schulz>Quentin Huys>Dominik Bach>Maarten Speekenbrink>Andreas Krause,">University College London, London, London, United Kingdom>ETH Zürich/University of Zürich>University of Zürich>University College London>ETH Zürich",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0205/index.html

In a categorization task, we found that adults were more likely to use labels to determine category boundaries compared to numbers or symbols, and that these effects persisted in all intentionality manipulations. These findings suggest that labels have a powerful effect on categorization compared to other cues; most strikingly, labels (but not other cues) are used during categorization even when people are specifically asked to ignore them. These results provide novel support for the position that labels indicate category membership.",>Felix Gervits>Megan Johanson>Anna Papafragou,>Tufts University>University of Delaware>University of Delaware,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0206/index.html

Our experimental results show that a Hebbian learner and a model that relies on hypothesis testing fail to account for the behavioral data obtained from both populations.

In Experiment 1, we test the assumptions of our model in a gridworld that requires coordination and contrast it with a “best response” model.

Natural language metaphors may act as frames that encourage people to reappraise an emotional situation, changing the way they respond to it. Recovery from cancer is one type of adversity that many people face, and it can be mediated by the mindset people adopt. We investigate whether two common metaphors for describing a cancer experience – the battle and the journey – encourage people to make different inferences about the patient’s emotional state. After being exposed to the battle metaphor participants inferred that the patient would feel more guilt if he didn’t recover, while after being exposed to the journey metaphor participants felt that he had a better chance of making peace with his situation.

Here we demonstrate that inequality can covary reliably with other cooperative behavior, despite a lack of exogenous cause or deliberation. Under simulated cultural evolution via social learning selecting for trust and cooperative exchange, we find both cooperation and inequality to be more prevalent in contexts where the same agents play both the roles of the trusting investor and the trusted investee, in contrast to conditions where roles are divided between subpopulations. Cooperation is more likely in contexts of high transparency about potential partners and with a high amount of partner choice; while inequality is more likely with high information but no choice in partners.

As new adaptive learning technologies become ubiquitous in education, they bring opportunities both to facilitate conceptual development in more focused ways and to gather data that may yield new insights into students’ learning processes. The present study analyzes data archives from a perceptual learning intervention designed to help students master key concepts related to linear measurement and fractions. Using algorithmic data coding on a database of 78,034 errors from a sample of sixth graders, both conceptual errors and other errors were captured and analyzed for change over time. Results indicate that conceptual errors decreased significantly. This approach suggests additional ways that such datasets can be exploited to better understand how the software impacts different students and how next generations of adaptive software may be designed to code and respond to common error patterns in real time.",>Christine Massey>Jennifer Kregor>Laura Cosgrove>Himchan Lee,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0211/index.html
2016,Generalisable patterns of gesture distinguish semantic categories in communication without language,"There is a long-standing assumption that gestural forms are geared by a set of modes of representation (acting, representing, drawing, moulding) with each technique expressing speakers’ focus of attention on specific aspects of referents (Müller, 2013). Beyond different taxonomies describing the modes of representation, it remains unclear what factors motivate certain depicting techniques over others. Results from a pantomime generation task show that pantomimes are not entirely idiosyncratic but rather follow generalisable patterns constrained by their semantic category. We show that a) specific modes of representations are preferred for certain objects (acting for manipulable objects and drawing for non-manipulable objects); and b) that use and ordering of deictics and modes of representation operate in tandem to distinguish between semantically related concepts (e.g., “to drink” vs “mug”).

2016,Singular Interpretations Linger During the Processing of Plural Noun Phrases,"Plural nouns do not strictly refer to more than one object, which suggests that they are not semantically marked to mean “more than one” and that plurality inferences are made via a scalar implicature. Consistent with that hypothesis, recent evidence using a picture-matching paradigm supports founds that participants were equally fast to respond to a picture of a single object as a picture of multiple objects after reading a sentence containing a plural. This suggests that comprehenders activate both a semantic (i.e., singular) and a pragmatic interpretation (i.e., plural). The current study found that even after a 1500 ms delay, comprehenders still maintain activation of both meanings after reading a sentence containing a plural. This suggests that the activation of the singular meaning may not be due to the processing of a scalar implicature, but rather may be due to the nature of plural conceptual representations.",>Nikole Patson,>Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0213/index.html
2016,Using determiners as contextual cues in sentence comprehension: A comparison between younger and older adults,"Younger adults use both semantic and phonological cues to quickly localize the referent during sentence comprehension. ERP studies have shown that older adults, as a group, are less apt at using contextual semantic cues to predict upcoming words. The current study extends the investigation of contextual cue processing beyond semantic cues, by comparing younger and older adults in their ability to use phonological cues in indefinite articles (a/an) in an eye-tracking paradigm. Our results suggest that both age groups use such contextual phonological information, but with different timelines: younger adults use the cues to anticipate an upcoming word, whereas older adults show delayed cue processing after the target word has been spoken. Together with past research, these findings support a model of sentence comprehension in which the use of contextual cues continues with aging, but is no longer as efficient as in the young system for anticipatory word retrieval.",>Nazbanou Nozari>Daniel Mirman,">Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore>Drexel University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0214/index.html
2016,Scarcity captures attention and induces neglect: Eyetracking and behavioral evidence,"Resource scarcity poses challenging demands on the human cognitive system. Budgeting with limited resources induces an attentional focus on the problem at hand. This focus enhances processing of relevant information, but it also comes with a cost. Specifically, scarcity may cause a failure to notice beneficial information that helps alleviate the condition of scarcity. In three experiments, participants were randomly assigned with a small budget (“the poor”) or a large budget (“the rich”) to order a meal from a restaurant menu. The poor participants looked longer at the prices of the items and recalled the prices more accurately, compared to the rich participants. Importantly, the poor neglected a useful discount that would save them money. This neglect may arise as a result of attentional narrowing, and help explain a range of counter-productive behaviors of low-income individuals.

We predicted that religious people would be more inclined to remember fabricated news events positively depicting religion and less likely to remember events negatively depicting religion compared to non-religious people. Opposite effects were predicted for events depicting atheism. In contrast, we found that religious people were more likely to falsely remember both events depicting religion positively and negatively compared to non-religious individuals. However, the extent to which individuals felt positively about the events interacted with religious beliefs to predict reported false memories.

This suggests that its users should be sensitive to failures of communication, such as utterances that are blatantly incoherent with respect to an ongoing conversation. We present experimental work suggesting that, in fact, people are surprisingly tolerant of conversational incoherence. In two previous studies, participants engaged in instant-messaging conversations that were either repeatedly crossed with other conversations or had lines inserted into them that deliberately contradicted available information. In both cases, a substantial proportion of participants failed to notice. In a new study, confederates inserted unexpected, nonsensical lines into face-to-face conversations. The majority of participants failed to notice.

An experiment with 71 6th and 7th grade students compared fraction addition instruction and practice with a magnitude representation to a tightly controlled non-magnitude condition. In the magnitude condition, students with better fraction magnitude estimation skills benefitted more from the conceptual instruction and this relationship was moderated by students’ knowledge of how magnitude relates to fraction addition and equivalence. However, students with better fraction magnitude estimation skills benefitted less from the practice problems with magnitude. In the non-magnitude condition, fraction magnitude estimation was not predictive of learning. This study indicates that students with magnitude knowledge can leverage it to learn fraction addition concepts from magnitude representations, but, for those students, magnitude representations may be a distraction from practicing the procedure.",>Eliane Wiese>Rony Patel>Kenneth Koedinger,">University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0220/index.html

Here we present a new memory model, termed Primary and Convergent Retrieval (PCR) that assumes successful recall leads to a selective enhancement for the second stage of recall (Convergent Retrieval). We applied this model to existing testing effect data. In two new experiments, we confirmed novel predictions of the PCR model for transfer between retrieval cues and for recall latencies.

To explore this interaction we present an agent-based model in which an individual simultaneously learns a lexicon and learns about the speaker's perspective, given a shared context and the speaker's utterances, through Bayesian inference. Simulations with this model show that (i) lexicon-learning and perspective-learning are interdependent: learning one is impossible without some knowledge of the other, (ii) lexicon- and perspective-learning can bootstrap each other, resulting in successful inference of both even when the learner starts with no knowledge of the lexicon and unhelpful assumptions about the minds of others, and (iii) receiving initial input from a `helpful' speaker (who adopts the learner's perspective on the world) paves the way for later learning from speakers with perspectives which diverge from the learner's.

Research has shown that young children and adults treat categories very differently, with young children favoring whole objects while adults focus on the key information in most cases. If so, then how can young children learn categories requiring focused attention to key features? Studies have shown that drawing attention to rules had facilitative effects. We sought to identify whether the effect was driven by instruction about rules or by stimulus-driven factors. Our results suggest that even with instruction, 4-year-olds were not able to attend to key information.

Our approach involves comparing the model-making strategies of architects with students to expose the creative extras architects bring to working with physical models. To study this we coded students and architects performing a design task. Architects differed from students along three dimensions. First, architects were more selective; they used fewer blocks overall and fewer variations. Second, architects appear to think more about spatial relationships and material constraints. Lastly, architects more often experiment with re-orientations: they position a block one way to see its relations to its neighbors; they reposition it another way to see how that changes how things look and feel. These findings suggest that designers interact with the material more effectively than students.

We evaluate this probabilistic language-of-thought model with data from an abstract rule learning experiment carried out with adults.

2016,Integrating physical reasoning and visual object recognition for fully occluded scene interpretation,"Conventional theories of visual object recognition treat objects effectively as abstract patterns of image features. They do not explicitly represent objects as physical entities in the world, with physical properties such as three-dimensional shape, mass, stiffness, elasticity, surface friction, and so on. However, for many purposes, an object's physical existence is central to our ability to recognize it and think about it. This is certainly true for recognition via haptic perception, i.e., perceiving objects by touch, but even in the visual domain an object's physical properties may directly determine how it looks and thereby how we recognize it. Here we show how a physical object representation can allow the solution of video problems, like perceiving an object under a cloth, that are otherwise difficult to accomplish without extensive experience, and we provide behavioral and computational evidence that people can use such a representation.",>Ilker Yildirim>Max Siegel>Josh Tenenbaum,">MIT, Rockefeller University>MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States>MIT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0226/index.html
2016,“This problem has no solution”: when closing one of two doors results in failure to access any.,"We investigated what happens when the spontaneous encoding of a problem is incongruent with its solving strategy. We created word problems from which two distinct semantic representations could be abstracted. Only one of these representations was consistent with the solving strategy. We tested whether participants could recode a semantically incongruent representation in order to access another, less salient, solving strategy. In experiment 1, participants had to solve arithmetic problems and to indicate which problems were unsolvable. In experiment 2, participants received solved problems and had to decide whether the solution was appropriate or not. In both experiments, participants had more difficulties acknowledging that problems inducing an incongruent representation could be solved than they had for problems inducing a congruent representation. This was confirmed by response times. These results highlight how semantic aspects can lead even adults to fail or succeed in the solving of arithmetic problems requiring basic mathematical knowledge.",>Hippolyte Gros>Emmanuel Sander>Jean-Pierre Thibaut,">University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, 75006, France>Paragraphe Lab, EA 349, University Paris 8, Department of Psychology,  2 Rue de la Liberté, 93526 Saint-Denis Cedex 02, France.>LEAD-CNRS, UMR 5022,  UB, Univ.

2016,Analogical Generalization and Retrieval for Denominal Verb Interpretation,"The creativity of natural language poses a significant theoretical problem. One example of this is denominal verbs (those derived from nouns) such as spoon in “She spooned me some sugar”. Traditional generative approaches typically posit a unique entry in the lexicon for this usage, though this approach has difficulty scaling. Construction Grammar has evolved as a competing theory which instead allows the syntactic form of the sentence itself to contribute semantic meaning. However, how people learn syntactic constructions remains an open question. One suggestion has been that they are learned through analogical generalization. We evaluate this hypothesis using a computational model of analogical generalization to simulate Kaschak and Glenberg’s (2000) study regarding interpretation of denominal verbs.",>Clifton McFate>Ken Forbus,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0228/index.html

Research into mindfulness has greatly expanded in recent years (Davidson & Kasniak, 2015) and a growing literature has documented effects of mindfulness training on cognition. However, the specific aspects of mindfulness meditation training for novice practitioners that might influence cognition remain unexplored. The present study used a rigorous, dual-blind design to investigate whether the attention-monitoring component of mindfulness meditation reduces mind-wandering and improves performance during reading comprehension and sustained attention tasks. When compared with relaxation meditation, mindfulness training improved recall of specific details from a text but did not reduce mind-wandering or affect sustained attention. The results are discussed with respect to design considerations when studying a meditation intervention.",>Alexa Romberg>Hank Haarmann,>University of Maryland>University of Maryland,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0229/index.html
2016,Which Learning Algorithms Can Generalize Identity-Based Rules to Novel Inputs?,We propose a novel framework for the analysis of learning algorithms that allows us to say when such algorithms can and cannot generalize certain patterns from training data to test data. In particular we focus on situations where the rule that must be learned concerns two components of a stimulus being identical. We call such a basis for discrimination an identity-based rule. Identity-based rules have proven to be difficult or impossible for certain types of learning algorithms to acquire from limited datasets. This is in contrast to human behaviour on similar tasks. Here we provide a framework for rigorously establishing which learning algorithms will fail at generalizing identity-based rules to novel stimuli. We use this framework to show that such algorithms are unable to generalize identity-based rules to novel inputs unless trained on virtually all possible inputs. We demonstrate these results computationally with a multilayer feedforward neural network.,>Paul Tupper>Bobak Shahriari,>Simon Fraser University>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0230/index.html
2016,Pragmatic relativity: Gender and context affect the use of personal pronouns in discourse differentially across languages,"Speakers use differential referring expressions in pragmatically appropriate ways to produce coherent narratives. Languages, however, differ in a) whether REs as arguments can be dropped and b) whether personal pronouns encode gender. We examine two languages that differ from each other in these two aspects and ask whether the co-reference context and the gender encoding options affect the use of REs differentially. We elicited narratives from Dutch and Turkish speakers about two types of three-person events, one including people of the same and the other of mixed-gender. Speakers re-introduced referents into the discourse with fuller forms (NPs) and maintained them with reduced forms (overt or null pronoun). Turkish speakers used pronouns mainly to mark emphasis and only Dutch speakers used pronouns differentially across the two types of videos. We argue that linguistic possibilities available in languages tune speakers into taking different principles into account to produce pragmatically coherent narratives.",>Zeynep Azar>Ad Backus>Asli Ozyurek,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Tilburg University>Radboud University Nijmegen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0231/index.html

John Stuart Mill described a probabilistic underpinning for analogical inference based on the the odds of observing systemic pairwise correspondence across otherwise independent systems by mere chance. Although proponents and critics have debated its validity, Mill’s approach has yet to be implemented computationally or studied psychologically. In this paper we examine Mill’s approach and show how it can be instantiated using Bayes theorem. Then we describe two experiments that present subjects with partially-revealed, aligned binary strings with varying degrees of intra- and inter-string regularity. Experimental results are compared to a formal rational analysis of the stimuli revealing conditions whereby participants exhibit confidence patterns consistent and inconsistent with Mill’s rational basis of analogy.",>Bradley Rogers>David Landy,">Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States>Indiana University Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0232/index.html
2016,Translating testimonial claims into evidence for category-based induction,"Inductive generalizations about the properties of kinds are based on evidence. But evidence can come either from our observations, or from the testimony of knowledgeable informants. The current study explores how we combine information from these two sources to make inductive inferences. Participants learned about a novel object category, and observed the property occur with some frequency in a sample of category members. Different groups of participants also heard an informant making either Generic, Quantified, or Specific claims about the prevalence of the property. Participants who heard generic claims were more resistant to a straightforward use of statistical evidence in their generalizations. Moreover, participants who rated the informant as more knowledgeable (across conditions) gave higher prevalence estimates. The results suggest two pathways through which testimony translates into evidence for category learning, and raise questions on how to best combine evidence from these different sources into a common representational form.",>Tamar Kushnir>Susan Gelman,">Cornell University>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0233/index.html
2016,Simple Search Algorithms on Semantic Networks Learned from Language Use,"Recent empirical and modeling research has focused on the semantic fluency task because it is informative about semantic memory. An interesting interplay arises between the richness of representations in semantic memory and the complexity of algorithms required to process it. It has remained an open question whether representations of words and their relations learned from language use can enable a simple search algorithm to mimic the observed behavior in the fluency task. Here we show that it is plausible to learn rich representations from naturalistic data for which a very simple search algorithm (a random walk) can replicate the human patterns. We suggest that explicitly structuring knowledge about words into a semantic network plays a crucial role in modeling human behavior in memory search and retrieval; moreover, this is the case across a range of semantic information sources.",>Aida Nematzadeh>Filip Miscevic>Suzanne Stevenson,>University of Toronto>University of Toronto>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0234/index.html
2016,Racial Essentialism is Associated With Prejudice Towards Blacks in 5- and 6-Year-Old White Children,"Psychological essentialism is a cognitive bias that leads people to view members of a category as sharing a deep, underlying, inherent nature that causes them to be fundamentally similar to one another in non-obvious ways. Although essentialist beliefs can be beneficial, allowing people to view the social world as stable and predictable, essentialist beliefs about social categories such as race or ethnicity are also thought to underlie the development of stereotyping and prejudice. While recent studies in adults have found that racial essentialism is associated with increased prejudice, the development of this relationship has rarely been examined. The present research examines the implications of essentialism for prejudice in a population of white five- and six-year old children in the United States, finding that essentialist beliefs about race are associated with increased implicit and explicit prejudice towards members of a minority racial group.",>Tara Mandalaywala>Marjorie Rhodes,">New York University, New York City, NY, USA>New York University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0235/index.html

This classic type of model has also been extended to account for natural language sentence processing effects (Johns & Jones, 2015).

Experimental data is contradictory, and incompatible models have been proposed. Here, we examine basic assumptions regarding the acoustic signal the learner deals with: Is speaker variability a hurdle in discriminating sounds or can it easily be ignored? To this end, we summarize existing infant data. We then present machine-based discriminability scores of sound pairs obtained without any language knowledge. Our results show that speaker variability decreases sound contrast discriminability, and that some contrasts are affected more than others. However, chance performance is rare; most contrasts remain discriminable in the face of speaker variation. We take our results to mean that speaker variation is not a uniform hurdle to discriminating sound contrasts, and careful examination is necessary when planning and interpreting studies testing whether and to what extent infants (and adults) are sensitive to speaker differences.",>Christina Bergmann>Alejandrina Cristia>Emmanuel Dupoux,">Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique (ENS, EHESS, CNRS), Ecole Normale Supérieure, PSL Research University>Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique (ENS, EHESS, CNRS), Ecole Normale Supérieure, PSL Research University>Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique (ENS, EHESS, CNRS), Ecole Normale Supérieure, PSL Research University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0237/index.html
2016,A Twist On Event Processing: Reorganizing Attention To Cope With Novelty In Dynamic Activity Sequences,"Fluent event processing appears to critically involve selectively attending to information-rich junctures within continuously unfolding sensory streams (e.g., Newtson, 1973). What counts as information-rich would seem to depend on a variety of factors, however, including the novelty/familiarity of such events, as well as opportunity for repeated viewings. Using Hard, Recchia, & Tversky’s “Dwell-time Paradigm,” we investigated the extent to which viewers’ attention to unfolding activity streams is affected by novelty/familiarity and a second viewing. Viewers’ dwell times were recorded as they advanced twice each through three slideshows varying in familiarity but equated on other dimensions. Dwell time patterns revealed reorganization on a number of fronts: a) familiarity elicited decreased dwelling overall, b) dwell-time patterns changed systematically on second viewing, and c) familiarity modulated the specific nature of change associated with repeated viewing. These findings illuminate reorganization in attention as action information is first encountered and quickly incorporated to guide processing.",>Jessica Kosie>Dare Baldwin,">University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA>University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0238/index.html
2016,Recursion in Nicaraguan Sign Language,"Syntactic recursion is argued to be a key property of natural languages, allowing us to create an infinite number of utterances from a finite number of words and rules. Some have argued that recursion is uniquely human. There are at least two possibilities for the origins of recursion: 1) Recursion is a property of the language faculty. 2) Recursion is an historical accomplishment and is culturally constructed over millennia. Here we ask whether an emerging sign language, Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL), exhibits syntactic recursion by comparing the language of the first three age cohorts of signers. Signers (n=27) watched and described vignettes designed to elicit relative clauses. Results suggest that signers from all three cohorts have strategies to fulfill the discourse function of relative clauses, picking out an individual from a set. The grammatical form of the utterances differs across cohorts, with signers from later cohorts clearly producing embedded structures.",>Annemarie Kocab>Ann Senghas>Jesse Snedeker,>Harvard University>Barnard College>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0239/index.html

We then compared these results to the predictions of various models of analogical reasoning. Results revealed a picture of common search patterns with local adaptations to the specifics of each paradigm in both looking-time duration and the number and types of saccades.

This phenomenon, predicted by the CHREST computational model, was first established with chess players. Recently, it has been shown through a meta-analysis that it generalises to nearly all domains where the effect has been tested. In this paper, we carry out computer simulations to test whether the mechanism postulated with chess experts – the acquisition and use of a large number of chunks – also applies to computer programming experts. The results show that a simplified version of CHREST (without the learning and use of high-level schemata known as templates) broadly captures the skill effect with scrambled programs. However, it fails to account for the differences found in humans between different types of randomisation. To account for these differences, additional mechanisms are necessary that use semantic processing.",>Fernand Gobet>Oliver Iain,">University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom>University of Nottingham",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0241/index.html

Two visual events occurred sequentially. Participants planned an action (3-key sequence) to the first event (Action A) maintaining this action in working memory while executing a speeded response to the second event (Action B). Afterwards, participants executed Action A. We manipulated whether Action B overlapped with the first, second or final feature of Action A, and examined the pattern of correct, Action B RTs at the different overlap locations by finger (index, middle, ring), as well as error rates of both Action A and Action B. Results indicate that sequences were not activated equally or in a gradient.

2016,Modeling adaptation to a novel accent,"Listeners quickly adapt to novel accents. There are three main hypotheses for how they do so. Some suggest that listeners expand their phonetic categories, allowing more variability in how a sound is pronounced. Others argue that listeners shift their categories instead, only accepting deviations consistent with the accent. A third hypothesis is that listeners shift and expand their categories. Most work has supported the category expansion hypotheses, with the key exception of Maye et al. (2008) who argued for a shifting strategy. Here, we apply the ideal adaptor model from Kleinschmidt & Jaeger (2015) to reexamine what conclusions can be drawn from their data. We compare adaptation models in which categories are shifted, expanded, or both shifted and expanded. We show that models involving expansion can explain the data as well as, if not better than, the shift model, in contrast to what has been previously concluded from these data.",>Kasia Hitczenko>Naomi Feldman,">University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA>University of Maryland, College Park",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0243/index.html
2016,Gibson's Reasons for Realism and Gibsonian Reasons for Anti-Realism: An Ecological Approach to Model-Based Reasoning in Science,"Representational views of the mind traditionally face a skeptical challenge on perceptual knowledge: if our experience of the world is mediated by representations built upon perceptual inputs, how can we be certain that our representations are accurate and our perceptual apparatus reliable? J. J. Gibson's ecological approach provides an alternative framework, according to which direct perception of affordances does away with the need to posit internal mental representations as intermediary steps between perceptual input and behavioral output. Gibson accordingly spoke of his framework as providing “reasons for realism.” In this paper I suggest that, granting Gibson his reasons for perceptual realism, the Gibsonian framework motivates anti-realism when it comes to scientific theorizing and modeling. If scientists are Gibsonian perceivers, then it makes sense to take their use of models in indirect investigations of real-world phenomena not as representations of the phenomena, but rather as autonomous tools with their own affordances.",>Guilherme Sanches de Oliveira,">University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0244/index.html
2016,Measuring the Causal Dynamics of Facial Interaction with Convergent Cross Mapping,"The nature of the dynamics of nonverbal interactions is of considerable interest to the study of human communication and future human-computer interaction. Facial expressions constitute an important source of nonverbal social signals. Whereas most studies have focused on the facial expressions of isolated individuals, the aim of this study is to explore the coupling dynamics of facial expressions in social dyadic interactions. Using a special experimental set-up, the frontal facial dynamics of pairs of socially interacting persons were measured and analyzed simultaneously. We introduce the use of convergent cross mapping, a method originating from dynamical systems theory, to assess the causal coupling of the dyadic facial-expression dynamics. The results reveal the presence of bidirectional causal couplings of the facial dynamics. We conclude that convergent cross mapping yields encouraging results in establishing evidence for causal behavioral interactions.",>Eric Postma>Marie Postma-Nilsenová,">TiCC, Tilburg, NB, Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0245/index.html

To that end, many security agencies have begun to use ""security game"" algorithms, which optimally plan defender allocations, using models of adversary behavior that have originated in behavioral game theory. To advance our understanding of adversary behavior, this paper presents results from a study involving an opportunistic crime security game (OSG), where human participants play as opportunistic adversaries against an algorithm that optimizes defender allocations. In contrast with previous work which often assumes homogeneous adversarial behavior, our work demonstrates that participants are naturally grouped into multiple distinct categories that share similar behaviors. We capture the observed adversarial behaviors in a set of diverse models from different research traditions, behavioral game theory and Cognitive Science, illustrating the need for heterogeneity in adversarial models.",>Yasaman Abbasi>Debarun kar>Nicole Sintov>Milind Tambe>Noam Ben-Asher>Don Morrison>Cleotilde Gonzalez,">University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>IBM T.J.

2016,"Semantic, Lexical, and Geographic Cues in Recall Processes","Semantic fluency tasks have increasingly been used to probe the structure of human memory, adopting methodologies from the ecological foraging literature to describe memory as a trajectory through semantic space. Clusters of semantically related items are often produced together, and the transitions between these clusters of semantically related items are consistent with theories of optimal foraging, where the search process exhibits a balance between exploration and exploitation (Hills, Jones, & Todd, 2012). Here, we use a semantic fluency memory task in which subjects recall geographic locations. For each pairwise transition, we measure temporal, geographic, semantic, lexical, and phonetic distances. In general, the dimensions are loosely but reliably correlated with each other. Segmentation of the retrieval sequence into patches supports the notion that subjects strategically leave patches as within-patch resources diminish, but also suggests that subjects may shift their attention between different sources of information, perhaps reflecting dynamically changing patch definitions.",>Janelle Szary>Michael N.

However, the relative importance of central versus peripheral information for object, scene, and face recognition is unclear. In a behavioral study, Larson and Loschky (2009) investigated this question by measuring the scene recognition accuracy as a function of visual angle, and demonstrated that peripheral vision was indeed more useful in recognizing scenes than central vision. In this work, we modeled and replicated the result of Larson and Loschky (2009), using deep convolutional neural networks. Having fit the data for scenes, we used the model to predict future data for large-scale scene recognition as well as for objects and faces.

Experiment 1 demonstrates that listeners learn to use limited exposure to new information and their general knowledge to anticipate sentence endings that align with the action of the sentence. Experiment 2 demonstrates participants learn to use combinatorial information from stories to elicit anticipatory eye movements to the target over the general knowledge distractor. Evidence from these experiments indicates even in the presence of semantic conflict with general knowledge, listeners rapidly increase the weight of novel information rather than general knowledge.",>Angele Yazbec>Michael Kaschak>Arielle Borovsky,>Florida State University>Florida State University>Florida State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0252/index.html

Pair has the advantage of greater precision, but triplet is potentially cognitive less taxing, thus resulting in less noisy responses. Here, we introduce several information-theoretic measures of how useful the two protocols are for response prediction and parameter estimation. We demonstrate that triplet is significantly better for extracting subject-specific preferences, while the two are comparable across subjects. While the specific conclusions should be interpreted cautiously, the work provides an information-theoretic framework for quantifying how repetitions within and across subjects can help to combat noise in human responses, as well as giving some insight into the nature of similarity representation and response noise in humans. More generally, this work demonstrates that substantial noise and inconsistency corrupt similarity judgments, both within- and across-subjects, with consequent implications for experimental design and data interpretation.",>Linjie Li>Vicente Malave>Amanda Song>Angela Yu,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States>University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California, USA>University of California, San Diego>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0253/index.html

In this study we use these well-known findings to guide our analysis of over 2.2 million business review ratings. We explore how both within-reviewer and within-business (between reviewer) ratings are influenced by previous ratings.

2016,Using Motor Dynamics to Explore Real-time Competition in Cross-situational Word Learning: Evidence From Two Novel Paradigms,"Adults can use cross-situational information to learn words, but it is unclear how much information they retain about the potential referents that occur with a word on each observation. We tested this question using novel mouse-tracking and finger-tracking paradigms. Adults encountered novel words in ambiguous training trials and were then tested on the words’ referents. In some test trials, participants saw both the target and a high-probability competitor that had repeatedly occurred with the word. Participants’ mouse trajectories were slower, less accurate, and more complex when the competitor was present, indicating participants were aware that both the target and competitor had occurred with the word. This suggests that learners can retain multiple potential referents for a word and mouse tracking provides a promising way of assessing this knowledge. However, this knowledge was not evident in participants’ finger movements, suggesting that finger tracking might not capture real-time competition between referents.",>John Bunce>Drew Abney>Chelsea Gordon>Michael Spivey>Rose Scott,>University of California Merced>University of California Merced>University of California Merced>University of California Merced>University of California Merced,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0255/index.html

Olfaction is believed to be weakly linked with language, as demonstrated by our poor odor naming ability, yet olfaction seems to be particularly susceptible to linguistic descriptions. We tested the boundaries of the influence of language on olfaction by focusing on a non-lexical aspect of language (grammatical gender). We manipulated the grammatical gender of fragrance descriptions to test whether the congruence with fragrance gender would affect the way fragrances were perceived and remembered. Native French and German speakers read descriptions of fragrances containing ingredients with feminine or masculine grammatical gender, and then smelled masculine or feminine fragrances and rated them on a number of dimensions (e.g., pleasantness). Participants then completed an odor recognition test. Fragrances were remembered better when presented with descriptions whose grammatical gender matched the gender of the fragrance.

Here, we report a computational neural network model for a two-cannon task, which naturally involves multiple FORs with different levels of salience: intrinsic frame of reference (IFOR) and egocentric frame of reference (EFOR). The goal is to investigate the computational neural mechanisms underlying human spatial performance. Our simulation results fit earlier behavioral results well. The model suggests although multiple FORs may be initially represented independently, they interfere with each other by the inhibitory competition of neurons in the later process (in hidden layer) for conflict resolution. Moreover, salience may modulate the competition by prioritizing FORs with high salience levels. These results represent a connectionist support for the FORMS theory.",>Weizhi Nan>Yanlong Sun>Xun Liu>Hongbin Wang,">Key Laboratory of Behavioral Science, Institute of Psychology,  Chinese Academy of Sciences, 16 Lincui Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100101, China>Center for Biomedical Informatics, Texas A&M; University Health Science Center,   2121 West Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA>Key Laboratory of Behavioral Science, Institute of Psychology,  Chinese Academy of Sciences, 16 Lincui Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100101, China>Center for Biomedical Informatics, Texas A&M; University Health Science Center,   2121 West Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0258/index.html
2016,Syntax Accommodation in Social Media Conversations,"The psycholinguistic theory of Communication Accommodation proposes that people modify communication dynamics to minimize (or maximize) their social differences. Research on communication accommodation has shown that people who want social approval will modify their linguistic style to match that of their interactant; however, most studies have been conducted on small-scale datasets and in laboratory situations. In this work, we investigate the relationship between linguistic syntax usage and conversation participation in a more naturalistic conversational setting: social media conversations on Reddit.com. We introduce a novel approach for calculating document-level syntax similarity by relying on natural language processing methods and graph theory techniques. Using the proposed method, we present the results of two experiments which demonstrate that users who comment on a post tend to use syntax similar to that of the original post.",>Reihane Boghrati>Joe Hoover>Kate M.

2016,Developmental Differences in Children's Statistical Learning Abilities,"Infants, children and adults are capable of implicitly extracting regularities from their environment through statistical learning (SL). SL is present from early infancy and found across tasks and modalities, raising questions about its domain generality. However, little is known about SL's developmental trajectory: Is SL fully developed capacity in infancy, or does it improve with age, like other cognitive skills? While SL is well established in infants and adults, only few studies looked at SL across development with conflicting results: some find age-related improvements while others do not. Importantly, despite its postulated role in language learning, no study has examined the developmental trajectory of auditory SL throughout childhood. Here, we conduct a large-scale study of children's auditory SL across a wide age-range (5-12y, N=115). Results show that auditory SL does not change much across development. We discuss implications for modality-based differences in SL and for its role in language acquisition.",>Limor Raviv>Inbal Arnon,">The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel>The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0260/index.html
2016,Under Pressure: How Time-Limited Cognition Explains Statistical Learning by 8-Month Old Infants,"In a classic experiment, Saffran, Aslin, and Newport (1996) used a headturn preference procedure to show that infants can discriminate between familiar syllable sequences (""words”) and new syllable sequences (""non-words"" and ""part-words""). While several computational models have simulated aspects of their data and proposed that the learning of transitional probabilities could be mediated by neural-net or chunking mechanisms, none have simulated the absolute values of infants' listening times in the different experimental conditions. In this paper, we used CHREST, a model based on chunking, to simulate these listening times. The model simulated the fact that infants listened longer to novel words (non-words and part-words) than familiar words. While the times observed with the model were longer than those observed with infants, we make a novel finding with regard to phonological store trace decay. We also propose how to modify CHREST to produce data that fits closer to the human data.",>Martyn Lloyd-Kelly>Fernand Gobet>Peter Lane,>University of Liverpool>University of Liverpool>University of Hertfordshire,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0261/index.html
2016,Exploring the Neural Mechanisms Supporting Structured Sequence Processing and Language Using Event-Related Potentials: Some Preliminary Findings,"Structured sequence processing (SSP) refers to the neurocognitive mechanisms used to learn sequential patterns. SSP seems to be important for language knowledge; however, there are few neural studies showing an empirical connection between SSP and language. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between SSP and language processing by comparing underlying neural components elicited during each type of task. Healthy adults completed a visual, non-linguistic SSP task and a visual morpho-syntactic language task. Both tasks were designed to cause violations in expectations of items occurring in a series. Event-related potentials were used to examine the neural mechanisms associated with these expectancy violations. The results indicated the P3a elicited by the SSP task and the P600 elicited by the language task shared similarities in their topographic distribution. These preliminary analyses suggest the P3a and P600 may reflect processes involving detection of sequential violations in non-language and language domains.",>Gretchen Smith>Gerardo Valdez>Anne Walk>John Purdy>Christopher Conway,">Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, United States>Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0262/index.html
2016,Bifurcation analysis of a Gradient Symbolic Computation model of incremental processing,"Language is ordered in time and an incremental processing system encounters temporary ambiguity in the middle of sentence comprehension. An optimal incremental processing system must solve two computational problems: On the one hand, it has to keep multiple possible interpretations without choosing one over the others. On the other hand, it must reject interpretations inconsistent with context. We propose a recurrent neural network model of incremental processing that does stochastic optimization of a set of soft, local constraints to build a globally coherent structure successfully. Bifurcation analysis of the model makes clear when and why the model parses a sentence successfully and when and why it does not---the garden path and local coherence effects are discussed.

2016,Coalescing the Vapors of Human Experience into a Viable and Meaningful Comprehension,"Models of learning concepts or theories often invoke a stochastic search process, in which learners generate hypotheses through some structured random process and then evaluate them on some data measuring their quality or value. To be successful within a reasonable time-frame, these models need ways of generating good candidate hypotheses before the data are considered. Schulz (2012a) has proposed that studying the origins of new ideas in more everyday contexts, such as how we think up new names for things, can provide insight into the cognitive processes that generate good hypotheses for learning. We propose a simple generative model for how people might draw on their experience to propose new names in everyday domains such as pub names or action movies, and show that it captures surprisingly well the names that people actually imagine. We discuss the role for an analogous hypothesis-generation mechanism in enabling and constraining causal theory learning.",>Tomer Ullman>Max Siegel>Josh Tenenbaum>Samuel Gershman,">MIT>MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States>MIT>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0264/index.html

Participants were asked to identify music notes, English letters, Chinese characters, and novel symbols (Tibetan letters) presented at random locations on the screen while maintaining central fixation. We found that for music note reading, musicians outperformed non-musicians at some peripheral positions in both visual fields, and for English letter reading, musicians outperformed non-musicians at some peripheral positions in the RVF but not in the LVF. In contrast, in both Chinese character and novel symbol reading, musicians and non-musicians did not differ in their performance at peripheral positions. Since both music and English reading involve a left-to-right reading direction and a RVF/LH advantage, these results suggest that the modulation of music reading experience on visual spans in language reading depends on the similarities in the cognitive processes involved.",>Tze Kwan Li>Susana T.

When it is a human-directed design, this includes the expectations of its users. How do we arrive at such a design? One approach starts from first principles to evaluate the quality of proposed designs. Here, we introduce a form of human-in-the-loop computation that synthesizes a design conforming to its users’ expectations. The technique begins by constructing a transmission chain seeded with a random design. Each user in the chain is exposed to the design and then recreates it. Through this iterative process, the users’ perceptual, inductive, and reconstructive biases transform the initial design into one better matched to human cognition, being easier to learn and harder to forget. We evaluated the approach in three domains — stimulus–response mappings, vanity phone numbers, and typesetting — and show that it produces a good design in each.",>Jordan W. Suchow>Michael D.

The evaluation of the action or inaction of a human is compared to those of two artificial agents – a humanoid robot and an automated system. Ratings of rightness, blamefulness and moral permissibility of action or inaction in incidental and instrumental moral dilemmas are used. The results show that for the artificial cognitive agents the utilitarian action is rated as more morally permissible than inaction. The humanoid robot is found to be less blameworthy for his choices compared to the human agent or to the automated system. Action is found to be more appropriate, more permissible, more right, and less blameworthy than inaction only for the incidental scenarios. The results are interpreted and discussed from the perspective of perceived moral agency.",>Evgeniya Hristova>Maurice Grinberg,">New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Bulgaria>New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Bulgaria",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0267/index.html

There is considerably less agreement on what perceptual and cognitive processes are involved. While it is clear that MOT is attentionally demanding, various accounts of MOT performance centrally involve pre-attentional mechanisms as well. In this paper we present an account of object tracking in the ARCADIA framework (Bridewell & Bello 2015) that treats MOT as dependent upon both pre-attentive and attention-bound processes. We show that with minimal addition this model replicates a variety of core phenomena in the MOT literature and provides an algorithmic explanation of human performance limitations.",>Paul Bello>Will Bridewell>Christina Wasylyshyn,">Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA>Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA>Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0268/index.html
2016,How do Distributions of Item Sizes Affect the Precision and Bias in Representing Summary Statistics?,"Many studies have shown that observers can accurately perceive and evaluate the statistical summary of presented objects’ attribute values, such as the average, without attending to each object. However, it remains controversial how the visual system integrates the attribute values (e.g., information on size) of multiple items and computes the average value. In this study, we tested how distributions of item sizes affect the precision and bias in judging average values. We predicted that if observers utilize all of the available size information equally, the distribution would have no effect, and vice versa. Our results showed that, with novice observers, judgement precision differed among size distributions and that the observers overestimated the size of the average value compared to the actual size under all conditions. However, this was not the case for experienced observers, who showed no effects of distribution type on average assessment performance.",>Midori Tokita>Akira Ishiguchi,>Mejiro University>Ochanomizu University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0269/index.html

Motivated by two lines of prior work -- children's inferential and communicative capacities and strategic reputation management -- we examine how children infer what others think of them given others' observations of their performance, and how they influence these beliefs through disclosing their performance. In Experiment 1, 3-5 year-olds played a luck-based game; one confederates watched the child win and another confederate watched the child lose. We asked the child to disclose an additional, unobserved win to one of the two confederates. We find that younger children overwhelmingly choose the person who previously saw them win. However, as age increased, children were more likely to choose to disclose to someone who previously saw them lose. In Experiment 2, adults played a similar third person version and selectively chose the person who saw the main character previously lose.",>Mika Asaba>Hyowon Gweon,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0270/index.html

For instance, when crime is a beast, people suggest enforcement-oriented approaches to crime-reduction (e.g., by augmenting the police force); when crime is a virus, on the other hand, people suggest systemic reforms for the affected community. In the current study, we find that extending metaphoric language into the descriptions of policy interventions bolsters the persuasive influence of metaphoric frames for an array of important is- sues. When crime is a beast, people are even more likely to endorse “attacking” the problem with harsh enforcement tac- tics; when crime is a virus people are even more likely to to endorse “treating” the problem through social reform.",>Paul Thibodeau>Peace Iyiewuare>Matias Berretta,>Oberlin College>Oberlin College>Oberlin College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0271/index.html
2016,How Does Generic Language Elicit Essentialist Beliefs?,"Generic language (e.g., “tigers have stripes,” “girls hate math”) is a powerful vehicle for communicating essentialist beliefs. One way generic language likely communicates these beliefs is by leading children to generate kind-based explanations about particular properties; e.g., if a child hears “girls hate math,” he may infer that there must be an inherent causal basis for the generalization, which in turn supports essentialist beliefs. However, it is also possible that simply hearing a category described with generics elicits the belief that the category is an appropriate kind to generalize about. On this account, even if the generic is negated (“girls don’t hate math”), the generic language might nonetheless lead children to essentialize the category. The current study supports the latter possibility, suggesting that even hearing negated generics (“girls don’t hate math”) may still foster social essentialism.",>Emily Foster-Hanson>Sarah-Jane Leslie>Marjorie Rhodes,>New York University>Princeton University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0272/index.html

Based on the assumption that multitasking constraints arise from shared representations between individual tasks, we describe a graph-theoretic approach to analyze these constraints. Our results are consistent with previous numerical work (Feng et al., 2014), showing that even modest amounts of shared representation induce dramatic constraints on the parallel processing capability of a network architecture. We further illustrate how this analysis method can be applied to specific neural networks to efficiently characterize the full profile of their parallel processing capabilities. We present simulation results that validate theoretical predictions, and discuss how these methods can be applied to empirical studies of controlled vs. and automatic processing and multitasking performance in humans.",>Sebastian Musslick>Biswadip Dey>Kayhan Ozcimder>Mostofa Patwary>Theodore L.

2016,Fractal Scaling and Implicit Bias: A Conceptual Replication of Correll (2008),"A racial priming article claimed that, relative to a control condition, an exotic variety of variability, called 1/ƒ noise, is altered when stereotypes impact participants’ judgments in an implicit prejudice task (Correll, 2008). However, Madurski and LeBel (2014) recently described two powerful, faithfully cloned, and apparently decisive studies that each failed to return a successful literal replication of Correll’s report. Madurski and LeBel outlined and subsequently eliminated several potential extraneous reasons for their replication failures, such as different participant demographics, participant non-compliance, poor psychometrics, and hardware discrepancies. By contrast, this article reports a successful conceptual replication of the pattern reported by Correll. Notably, this conceptual replication required adjustments to Correll’s original method and statistical analyses. All the changes were dictated by a systems theory of 1/ƒ noise that was largely in place prior to Correll’s report.

2016,The Relationship Between the Numerical Distance Effect and Approximate Number System Acuity is Non-Linear,"People can estimate numerical quantities, like the number of grapes in a bunch, using the Approximate Number System (ANS). Individual differences in this ability (ANS acuity) are emerging as an important predictor in research areas ranging from math skills to judgment and decision making. One commonly used ANS acuity metric is the size of the Numerical Distance Effect (NDE): the amount of savings in RT or errors when distinguishing stimuli values as the numerical distance between them increases. However, the validity of this metric has recently been questioned. Here, we model the relationship between the NDE-size and ANS acuity. We demonstrate that the relationship between NDE-size and ANS acuity should not be linear, but rather should resemble an inverted J-shaped distribution, with the largest NDE-sizes typically being found for near average ANS acuities.",>Dana Chesney,">St, John's University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0275/index.html

Despite the different nature of these tasks, they all have a common feature - a final goal with an unknown location in a complex environment. This property of the search raises a problem of trade-off between exploration of new opportunities and exploitation of the known information. We used the data from the semantic fluency task experiment to investigate how humans switch between exploration and exploitation strategies when they search in memory. On comparing different search models, the one that assumes that humans switch strategies according to the semantic quality of the current neighbourhood best fits the data. Moreover, participants who set higher thresholds for the words with better quality of the neighbourhood tend to retrieve more words. We also used regression analysis to find out which factors affect efficiency of both strategies.",>Evgenii Nikitin>Thomas Hills,">University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom>University of Warwick",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0276/index.html
2016,"Context, but not proficiency, moderates the effects of metaphor framing: A case study in India","Metaphors suffuse language and affect how people think. A meta-analysis of metaphor framing studies conducted between 1983 and 2000 concluded that metaphors are about 6% more persuasive than literal language (Sopory & Dillard, 2002). However, each of these studies was conducted in English with samples drawn from populations of native English speakers. Here, we test whether and how language proficiency moderates the influence of metaphor frames. Sampling from a population of non-native, but generally proficient, English speakers from India, we found that metaphor frames systematically affected people who reported using English primarily in informal contexts (i.e., among friends and family and through the media) but not for people who reported using English primarily in formal contexts (i.e., for school or work).

What determines what propositions and phenomena are perceived as knowable or unknowable? We tested whether factors related to scientific methodology (a proposition’s reducibility and falsifiability), its intrinsic metaphysics (the materiality of the phenomena and its scope of applicability), and its relation to other knowledge (its centrality to one’s other beliefs and values) influence knowability. Across a wide range of naturalistic scientific and pseudoscientific phenomena (Studies 1 and 2), as well as artificial stimuli (Study 3), we found that reducibility and falsifiability have strong direct effects on knowability, that materiality and scope have strong indirect effects (via reducibility and falsifiability), and that belief and value centrality have inconsistent and weak effects on knowability. We conclude that people evaluate the knowability of propositions consistently with principles proposed by epistemologists and practicing scientists.",>Samuel Johnson>Kristen Kim>Frank Keil,">Yale University, New Haven, CT>Princeton University, Princeton, NJ>Yale University, New Haven, CT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0278/index.html

We extend this research by describing a neural model that rapidly plans action sequences in relatively unconstrained domains by manipulating structured representations of objects and the actions they typically afford. We provide an analysis that indicates our model is able to reliably accomplish goals that require correctly performing a sequence of up to 5 actions in a simulated environment. We also provide an analysis of the scaling properties of our model with respect to the number of objects and affordances that constitute its knowledge of the environment. Using simplified simulations we find that our model is likely to function effectively while picking from 10,000 actions related to 25,000 objects.",>Peter Blouw>Chris Eliasmith>Bryan Tripp,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0279/index.html

We find that item and associative information are retrieved concurrently, with positive memory evidence arising from a holistic match between the test pair and the contents of memory, in which both item and associative matches are pooled together into a single source. This retrieval architecture is inconsistent with both strictly serial processing and independence of item and associative information. Pooling of item and associative matches implies that while item and associative information may be separable, they are not qualitatively different, nor are qualitatively different processes (e.g., familiarity vs. recollection) used to retrieve these kinds of information.",>Gregory Cox>Amy Criss,>Syracuse University>Syracuse University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0280/index.html

Finally, children learn to apply the counting procedure to their entire count list. Although these stages are ubiquitous and well documented, the foundation of these meanings remains highly contested. Here we ask whether children assign preliminary meanings to number words before learning their exact meanings by examining their responses on the Give-a-Number task to numbers for which they do not yet have exact meanings. While several research groups have approached this question before, we argue that because these data do not usually conform to a normal distribution, typical methods of analysis likely underestimate their knowledge. Using non-parametric analyses, we show that children acquire non-exact meanings for small number words like one, two, three, four and possibly for higher numbers well before they acquire the exact meanings.",>Junyi Chu>Katie Wagner>David Barner,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0281/index.html

We survey the evidence that sleep aids memory consolidation in various declarative and implicit memory tasks and review the basic neurophysiological structure of sleep with a focus on understanding what neural systems are involved. Drawing on machine learning research, we discuss why it might be useful for humans–and robots, perhaps–to have such an offline period for processing, even though humans are clearly capable of learning incrementally, online. Finally, we propose and simulate two mechanisms for use in computational memory models to accomplish sleep-based consolidation via either or both 1) re-encoding knowledge representations and 2) reactivating and strengthening recent memories.",>George Kachergis>Roy de Kleijn>Bernhard Hommel,">New York University>Leiden University / Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, Netherlands>Leiden University / Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition, Leiden, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0282/index.html

Children’s numerical competence was then assessed using the Give-N-Task (Sarnecka & Carey, 2008; Wynn, 1990).

In their everyday lives, toddlers constantly create learning experiences by actively manipulating objects and thus self-selecting object views for visual learning. The work in this paper is based on the hypothesis that active viewing and exploration of toddlers actually creates high-quality training data for object recognition. We tested this idea by collecting egocentric video data of free toy play between toddler-parent dyads, and used it to train state-of-the-art machine learning models (Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs).

However its processing consequences at the behavioral and neural level in spoken word comprehension are not well understood. The current paper presents the behavioral and electrophysiological outcome of an auditory lexical decision task in which native speakers of Dutch listened to onomatopoeic words and matched control words while their electroencephalogram was recorded. Behaviorally, onomatopoeic words were processed as quickly and accurately as words with an arbitrary mapping between form and meaning. Event-related potentials time-locked to word onset revealed a significant decrease in negative amplitude in the N2 and N400 components and a late positivity for onomatopoeic words in comparison to the control words.

However, to date, no published study has demonstrated a similar emergence of linguistic structure in children. This gap is problematic given that languages are mainly learned by children and that adults may bring existing linguistic biases to the task. Here, we conduct a large-scale study of iterated language learning in both children and adults, using a novel, child-friendly paradigm. Results show that while children make more mistakes overall, their languages become more learnable and show learnability biases similar to those of adults. Child languages did not show a significant increase in linguistic structure over time, but consistent mappings between meanings and signals did emerge on many occasions, as found with adults. This provides the first demonstration that cultural transmission affects the languages children and adults produce similarly.",>Limor Raviv>Inbal Arnon,">The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel>The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0289/index.html
2016,Outcome or Strategy? A Bayesian Model of Intelligence Attribution,"People have a common-sense notion of intelligence and use it to evaluate decisions and decision-makers. We propose a model of intelligence attribution based on inverse planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The model explains the agent's decisions by a combination of probabilistic planning, a softmax decision noise, prior knowledge about the world and forgetting, estimating the agent's intelligence as efficiency in optimising costs and rewards. Behavioural evidence shows that some people attribute intelligence to the strategy and others attribute intelligence to the outcome of the observed actions. People in the strategy cluster attribute more intelligence to decisions that minimise the agent's overall cost, even if the outcome is unlucky. People in the outcome cluster attribute intelligence to the outcome, preferring low-cost outcomes even if the outcome is accidental and make neutral judgements before they observe the result. Our model explains human judgements better than perceptual cues.",>Marta Kryven>Tomer Ullman>William Cowan>Josh Tenenbaum,">University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0290/index.html

We develop a computational model and use this to guide experiments into the truth conditions of habitual language. In Expts. 1 & 2, we measure participants’ prior expectations about the frequency with which an event occurs and validate the predictions of the model for when a habitual sentence is acceptable. In Expt. 3, we show that habituals are sensitive to top-down moderators of expected frequency: It is the expectation of future tendency that matters for habitual language.

To date, most experiments showing evidence of learning non-adjacent dependencies have used artificial languages in which the to-be-learned dependencies are presented in isolation by presenting the minimal sequences that contain the dependent elements. However, dependencies in natural language are not typically isolated in this way. In this study we exposed learners to non-adjacent dependencies in long sequences of words. We accelerated the speed of presentation and learners showed evidence for learning of non-adjacent dependencies. The previous pause-based positional mechanisms for learning of non-adjacent dependency are challenged.",>Hao Wang>Jason Zevin>Toben Mintz,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0292/index.html

2016,A Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Theory Perspective on Dual-Processing Accounts of Decision-Making under Uncertainty,"Dual-processing accounts of reasoning have gained renewed attention in the past decade, particularly in the fields of social judgment, learning, and decision-making under uncertainty. Although the various accounts differ, the common thread is the distinction between two qualitatively different types of reasoning: explicit/implicit, rational/affective, fast/slow, etc. Consequently, much research has focused on characterizing the two different processes. Less extensive are the attempts to find mediators that influence which process is used. In this paper, we argue that the missing perspective on these dual-processing theories is rooted in dynamical systems theory. By shifting the perspective to the dynamic interaction and transitions between different types of reasoning, we provide a theoretical framework for dual-processing with an emphasis on phase transitions. As a special case, we focus on dual-processing in decision-making and judgment under uncertainty for which we will propose suggestions for future experimental evaluation.",>Marieke M. J.

2016,Coordinate to cooperate or compete: Abstract goals and joint intentions in social interaction,"Successfully navigating the social world requires reasoning about both high-level strategic goals, such as whether to cooperate or compete, as well as the low-level actions needed to achieve those goals. We develop a hierarchical model of social agency that infers the intentions of other agents, strategically decides whether to cooperate or compete with them, and then executes either a cooperative or competitive planning program. Learning occurs across both high-level strategic decisions and low-level actions leading to the emergence of social norms. We test predictions of this model in multi-agent behavioral experiments using rich video-game like environments. By grounding strategic behavior in a formal model of planning, we develop abstract notions of both cooperation and competition and shed light on the computational nature of joint intentionality.",>Max Kleiman-Weiner>Mark Ho>Joseph Austerweil>Michael Littman>Josh Tenenbaum,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA>Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA>Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0295/index.html

Participants attempted to solve Duncker’s (1945) Radiation Problem after reading and retelling a story that described an analogous solution in a different domain. Participants were instructed to gesture, instructed not to gesture, or given no instructions regarding gesture as they retold the story. Participants who were instructed to gesture as they retold the analogous story were more likely to mention perceptual details in their description and less likely to apply the analogous solution to the problem than participants who were instructed not to gesture. These results suggest that gestures can be detrimental to analogous problem solving when the perceptual elements of a story are irrelevant to its schematic similarity with a problem.",>Autumn Hostetter>Mareike Wieth>Katlyn Foster>Keith Moreno>Jeffery Washington,>Kalamazoo College>Albion College>Albion College>Kalamazoo College>Kalamazoo College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0296/index.html
2016,From uh-oh to tomorrow: Predicting age of acquisition for early words across languages,"Why do children learn some words earlier than others? Regularities and differences in the age of acquisition for words across languages yield insights regarding the mechanisms guiding word learning. In a large-scale corpus analysis, we estimate the ages at which 9,200 children learn 300-400 words in seven languages, predicting them on the basis of independently-derived linguistic, environmental, and conceptual factors. Predictors were surprisingly consistent across languages, but varied across development and as a function of lexical category (e.g., concreteness predicted nouns while linguistic structure predicted function words). By leveraging data at a significantly larger scale than previous work, our analyses highlight the power that emerges from unifying previously disparate theories, but also reveal the amount of reliable variation that still remains unexplained.",>Mika Braginsky>Daniel Yurovsky>Virginia Marchman>Mike Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0297/index.html
2016,Lexical Complexity of Child-Directed and Overheard Speech: Implications for Learning,"Although previous studies have found a link between the child-directed speech learners receive and their vocabulary development, no previous studies have found a parallel link between early measures of overheard speech and vocabulary. This is despite the fact that children are able to learn words from overheard speech in laboratory settings (Shneidman & Woodward, 2015). Drawing on the idea that children preferentially attend to stimuli that are at a manageable level of complexity (Kidd, Piantadosi, & Aslin, 2012, 2014), the present research explores the possibility that children do not initially tune into overheard speech because it is too complex for their stage of lexical development. Using transcripts from CHILDES and the SBC, and estimates of vocabulary by age from the MB-CDI, we find that child-directed speech is significantly less complex than overheard speech through at least 30 months, suggesting children may only begin learning from more complex, overheard speech later.",>Ruthe Foushee>Tom Griffiths>Mahesh Srinivasan,">University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0298/index.html
2016,Degeneracy results in canalisation of language structure: A computational model of word learning,"There is substantial variation in language experience between learners, yet there is surprising similarity in the language structure they eventually acquire. While it is possible that this canalisation of language structure may be due to constraints imposed by modulators, such as an innate language system, it may instead derive from the broader, communicative environment in which language is acquired. In this paper, the latter perspective is tested for its adequacy in explaining the robustness of language learning to environmental variation. A computational model of word learning from cross-situational, multimodal information was constructed and tested. Key to the model’s robustness was the presence of multiple, individually unreliable information sources that could support learning when combined. This “degeneracy” in the language system had a detrimental effect on learning when compared to a noise-free environment, but was critically important for acquiring a canalised system that is resistant to environmental noise in communication.",>Padraic Monaghan,>Lancaster University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0299/index.html
2016,General Mechanisms Underlying Language and Spatial Cognitive Development,"Previous research showed that children’s spatial language production predicts their spatial skills, but the mechanisms underlying this relation remain a source of debate. This study examined whether 4-year-olds’ spatial skills were predicted by their attention to task-relevant information—in tasks that emphasize either memory or language—above and beyond their spatial word production. Children completed three types of tasks: (1) a memory task assessing attention to task-relevant color, size, and location cues; (2) a production task assessing adaptive use of language to describe scenes, varying in color, size, and location; and (3) spatial tasks. After controlling for age, gender, and vocabulary, children’s spatial skills were significantly predicted by their memory for task-relevant cues, above and beyond their task-related language production and adaptive use of language. These findings suggest that attending to relevant information is a process supporting spatial skill acquisition and underlies the relation between language and spatial cognition.",>Hilary Miller>Vanessa Simmering,>University of Wisconsin Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0300/index.html
2016,When the Words Don’t Matter: Arbitrary labels improve categorical alignment through the anchoring of categories,"Novel labels provide feedback that may enhance categorical alignment between interlocutors. However, the nature of this feedback may not always be linguistic. Lupyan (2008) has demonstrated the effects of labels on individual categorization, and even non-word labels have seemingly produced greater consistency in sorting strategies (Lupyan & Casasanto, 2014). We extend this to alignment by demonstrating that arbitrary labels can increase sorting consistency to bring people’s categories closer together, even without dialogue. Importantly, we argue that increased alignment is not always due to labeling in a linguistic sense. Results suggest that it is not the content of the non-word labels driving the alignment effects, but the very presence of the labels acting as ‘anchors’ for category formation. This demonstrates a more general cognitive effect of arbitrary labels on categorization.",>Ellise Suffill>Martin Pickering>Holly Branigan,">University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0301/index.html
2016,Can the High-Level Semantics of a Scene be Preserved in the Low-Level Visual Features of that Scene? A Study of Disorder and Naturalness,"Real-world scenes contain low-level visual features (e.g., edges, colors) and high-level semantic features (e.g., objects and places). Traditional visual perception models assume that integration of low-level visual features and segmentation of the scene must occur before high-level semantics are perceived. This view implies that low-level visual features of a scene alone do not carry semantic information related to that scene. Here we present evidence that suggests otherwise. We show that high-level semantics can be preserved in low-level visual features, and that different high-level semantics can be preserved in different types of low-level visual features. Specifically, the ‘disorder’ of a scene is preserved in edge features better than color features, whereas the converse is true for ‘naturalness.’ These findings suggest that semantic processing may start earlier than thought before, and integration of low-level visual features and segmentation of the scene may occur after semantic processing has begun, or in parallel.",>Hiroki Kotabe>Omid Kardan>Marc Berman,>University of Chicago>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0302/index.html

Previous approaches to identity have suggested that there is a type of feature that is most defining of identity (e.g., autobiographical memories or moral qualities). We propose a new approach to identity that suggests that, like concepts in general, more causally central features are perceived as more defining of the self-concept. In three experiments, using both measured and manipulated causal centrality, we find that changes to features of identity that are perceived as more causally central are more disruptive to both the identity of the self and others.",>Stephanie Chen>Daniel Bartels>Oleg Urminsky,>University of Chicago>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0303/index.html

However, distinct patterns of temporal and numerical processing occur in the presence of emotional stimuli, calling into question theories of a common magnitude system, while also unveiling questions regarding the mechanisms underlying these temporal and numerical biases. We tested whether numerical processing, like temporal processing, may be impacted by increased arousal levels, yet have a higher threshold level in order to impact estimates. If so, then induced arousal may reverse the typical pattern of numerical underestimation in the presence of emotions. Adults (N = 85) participated in either a stress-induction or a control version of the task. Then, participants completed a numerical bisection task in the presence and absence of emotional content. Increasing arousal had no impact on numerical processing, except in the presence of happy faces, providing further evidence for distinct processing mechanisms.",>Karina Hamamouche>Michelle Hurst>Sara Cordes,>Boston College>Boston College>Boston College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0304/index.html

For example, labeling objects or features of problems can support categorization and relational thinking. Less is known about their role in making inferences about the structure of mathematics problems. We test the impact of labeling decimals such as 0.25 using formal place value labels (“two tenths and five hundredths”) compared to informal labels (“point two five”) or no labels on children’s problem-solving performance. Third- and fourth-graders (N = 104) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (formal labels, informal labels, or no labels) and labeled decimals while playing a magnitude comparison game and number line estimation task. Formal labels facilitated performance on comparison problems that required understanding the role of zero, which highlighted place value structure. However, formal labels hindered performance when explicit understanding of place value magnitudes was required.

2016,Implicit measurement of motivated causal attribution,"Moral judgment often involves pinning causation for harm to a particular person. Since it reveals ""who one sides with,"" expression of moral judgment can be a costly social act that people may be motivated to conceal. Here, we demonstrate that a simple, well-studied psycholinguistic task (implicit causality) can be leveraged as a novel implicit measure of morally relevant causal attributions. Participants decided whether to continue sentences like ""Amy killed Bob because..."" with either the pronoun ""he"" or ""she"". We found that (1) implicit causality selections predicted explicit causal judgments, (2) selecting the object (victim) for harm/force events (e.g., kill, rape) predicted endorsement of moral values previously linked to victim-blame, and (3) higher hostile sexism predicted selecting the female as the cause in male-on-female harm/force.

2016,"Boredom, Information-Seeking and Exploration","Any adaptive organism faces the choice between taking actions with known benefits (exploitation), and sampling new actions to check for other, more valuable opportunities available (exploration). The latter involves information-seeking, a drive so fundamental to learning and long-term reward that it can reasonably be considered, through evolution or development, to have acquired its own value, independent of immediate reward. Similarly, behaviors that fail to yield information may have come to be associated with aversive experiences such as boredom, demotivation, and task disengagement. In accord with these suppositions, we propose that boredom reflects an adaptive signal for managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, in the service of optimizing information acquisition and long-term reward. We tested participants in three experiments, manipulating the information content in their immediate task environment, and showed that increased perceptions of boredom arise in environments in which there is little useful information, and that higher boredom correlates with higher exploration.",>Andra Geana>Robert Wilson>Nathaniel Daw>Jonathan Cohen,">Princeton University, Princeton, NJ>University of Arizona>Princeton University>Princeton University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0307/index.html
2016,Analyzing distributional learning of phonemic categories in unsupervised deep neural networks,"Infants’ speech perception adapts to the phonemic categories of their native language, a process assumed to be driven by the distributional properties of speech. This study investigates whether deep neural networks (DNNs), the current state-of-the-art in distributional feature learning, are capable of learning phoneme-like representations of speech in an unsupervised manner. We trained DNNs with unlabeled and labeled speech and analyzed the activations of each layer with respect to the phones in the input segments. The analyses reveal that the emergence of phonemic invariance in DNNs is dependent on the availability of phonemic labeling of the input during the training. No increased phonemic selectivity of the hidden layers was observed in the purely unsupervised networks despite successful learning of low-dimensional representations for speech. This suggests that additional learning constraints or more sophisticated models are needed to account for the emergence of phone-like categories in distributional learning operating on natural speech.",>Okko Räsänen>Tasha Nagamine>Nima Mesgarani,>Aalto University>Columbia University>Columbia University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0308/index.html

Communication appears to proceed both more efficiently and more smoothly when information is distributed evenly across the linguistic signal. In previous work (Ramscar et al., 2013), we used tools from information theory to examine how naming systems evolved to meet this requirement historically, and how, over the past several hundred years, social legislation and rapid population growth have disrupted naming practices in the West, making names ever harder to process and remember. In support of these observations, we present findings from three experiments investigating name fluency, recognition, and recall. These results provide converging empirical evidence for an optimal solution to name design, and offer a more nuanced understanding of how social engineering has impaired the structure of names in memory.",>Melody Dye>Brendan Johns>Michael Jones>Michael Ramscar,>Indiana University>University of Buffalo>Indiana University>University of Tübingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0309/index.html

Theoretical accounts of metaphor processing appeal to dimensions like conventionality and aptness to explain variability in metaphor comprehensibility. In a typical experiment, one group of naive participants rates a set of metaphoric sentences along these dimensions, while another is timed reading the same sentences. Then, the ratings are used to predict response times in order to identify the most relevant linguistic dimension for metaphor comprehension. However, surprisingly high correlations between ratings of theoretically orthogonal constructs and the results of an experiment in which a context manipulation affected ratings of metaphor conventionality and aptness suggest that these measures should be treated as dependent, rather than explanatory, variables.

2016,Listener sensitivity to foreign-accented speech with grammatical errors,"The present accent rating study investigates the interaction between accent strength and grammatical correctness on perceived accentedness. German native (L1) listeners rated German sentences produced by L1 and non-native (L2) speakers. Sentences either contained a grammatical error or were grammatically correct. Results showed that grammatical correctness affected the accent rating of sentences produced by L1 speakers, but not of those by L2 speakers. The inverse influence of grammatical errors on sentences spoken with stronger accents suggests that phonological information plays a more important role for global perception of speech accentedness than grammatical correctness does, revealing a hierarchical importance of factors that form an L2 accent. This finding is in line with recent findings from an online processing ERP study (Hanulíková, van Alphen, van Goch, & Weber, 2012) in which L1 listeners were tolerant towards grammatical errors made by L2 speakers, i.e. showed no P600 effect for grammatically incorrect sentences.",>Yuki Asano>Andrea Weber,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0311/index.html
2016,A Comparative Evaluation of Approximate Probabilistic Simulation and Deep Neural Networks as Accounts of Human Physical Scene Understanding,"Humans demonstrate remarkable abilities to predict physical events in complex scenes. Two classes of models for physical scene understanding have recently been proposed: ``Intuitive Physics Engines'', or IPEs, which posit that people make predictions by running approximate probabilistic simulations in causal mental models similar to physics engines, and memory-based models like convolutional networks, which make judgments based on analogies to stored experiences of previously encountered scenes and outcomes. Here we report four experiments that rigorously compare simulation-based and CNN-based models, where both approaches are concretely instantiated in algorithms that can run on raw image inputs and produce as outputs physical judgments. Both approaches can achieve super-human accuracy levels and can quantitatively predict human judgments to a similar degree, but only the simulation-based models generalize to novel situations in ways that people do, and are qualitatively consistent with systematic perceptual illusions and judgment asymmetries that people show.",>Renqiao Zhang>Jiajun Wu>Chengkai Zhang>William T.

The basis for the observed segmentation tendencies, however, remains largely unknown. We introduce a computational model that grounds EST in the interaction abilities of a system. The model learns events and event boundaries based on actively gathered sensorimotor signals. It segments the signals based on principles of probabilistic predictive coding and surprise. The implemented model essentially simulates, anticipates, and learns event progressions and event transitions online while interacting with the environment by means of dynamic, predictive Bayesian models. Besides the model’s event segmentation capabilities, we show that the learned encodings can be used for higher-order planning. Moreover, the encodings systematically conceptualize environmental interactions and they help to identify the factors that are critical for ensuring interaction success.",>Christian Gumbsch>Jan Kneissler>Martin Butz,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany>University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0313/index.html

An adaptive organism therefore should place value on information independent of immediate reward, and affective states may signal such value (e.g., curiosity vs. boredom: Hill & Perkins, 1985; Eastwood et al. 2012). Here, we augment the classic serial foraging scenario to more explicitly reward the development of knowledge. We develop a formal model that quantifies the value of information in this setting and how it should impact decision making, paralleling the treatment of reward by the marginal value theorem (MVT) in the foraging literature.

However, little is currently known about the overall ways in which number words are used in child-directed speech. To address this, we performed an analysis of how number words are used in the CHILDES database. We looked at four statistics: 1) lexical frequency, 2) contextual diversity, 3) word co-occurrence, and 4) distributional similarity, to see if these distributional statistics suggest why some aspects of number acquisition are easy and others are hard, and if these statistics are informative about specific debates in number acquisition. We found that that are many important differences in how small and large number words are used (such as differences in frequency, co-occurrence patterns, and distributional similarity), differences that may play an role in shaping hypotheses about children’s acquisition of number concepts.",>Jon Willits>Michael Jones>David Landy,">University of California Riverside>Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0315/index.html

To investigate how humans achieve this remarkable ability, the present study extended the classical water-pouring problem (Schwartz & Black, 1999) to examine how humans consider physical properties of fluids (e.g., viscosity) and perceptual variables (e.g., volume) in a reasoning task. We found that humans do not rely on simple heuristic rules to reason about fluid dynamics. Instead, they rely on perceived viscosity and volume to make their judgments. Computational results from a probabilistic simulation model reliably account for human sensitivity to latent fluid attributes and their performance on our task. In contrast, non-simulation models based on statistical learning fail to fit human performance. Our results provide converging evidence supporting mental simulation strategies in physical reasoning, and outline experimental conditions that rectify the dissociation between explicit prediction and tacit judgment.",>James Kubricht>Chenfanfu Jiang>Yixin Zhu>Song-Chun Zhu>Demetri Terzopoulos>Hongjing Lu,">UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0316/index.html

Experiment 1 provided problems in a story context, and found that performance on slope comparison problems was low, especially when problems were presented with equations. Experiment 2 tested whether performance on slope comparison problems improves when problem prompts include explicit mathematical terminology rather than just natural language consistent with the problem story. Results suggest that many undergraduate students fail to access the mathematical concept of slope when problem prompts are presented with natural language.

As idiomatic processing models have presented evidence for an idiomatic mode of processing that can be activated for non-native speakers in highly figurative contexts (Bobrow & Bell, 1973), this experiment revisits those claims while also examining access to figurative meaning in addition to the literal meaning of individual words within an idiom. This experiment showed increased priming for visual targets related to the figurative meaning of an idiom when the experimental list contained a large proportion of idiomatic sentences compared to when the list contained only a small proportion of idiomatic sentences. Non-native speakers not only showed online access to figurative meaning but were also sensitive to highly idiomatic contexts; though, responses to the targets related to literal meaning of the final word of the idiom were faster in all instances than figuratively-related targets.",>Sara Beck>Andrea Weber,>University of Tübingen>University of Tübingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0318/index.html
2016,Synthesized size-sound sound-symbolism,"Studies of sound-symbolism have shown that people can associate sound and meaning in consistent ways when presented with maximally contrastive stimulus pairs of nonwords such as bouba/kiki (rounded/sharp) or mil/mal (big/small). Recent work has shown the effect extends to antonymic words from natural languages and has proposed a role for shared cross-modal correspondences in biasing form-to-meaning associations. An important open question is how the associations work, and particularly what the role is of sound-symbolic matches versus mismatches. We report on a learning task designed to distinguish between three existing theories by using a spectrum of sound-symbolically matching, mismatching, and neutral (neither matching nor mismatching) stimuli. Synthesized stimuli allow us to control for prosody, and the inclusion of a neutral condition allows a direct test of competing accounts. We find evidence for a sound-symbolic match boost, but not for a mismatch difficulty compared to the neutral condition.",>Gwilym Lockwood>Peter Hagoort>Mark Dingemanse,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0319/index.html
2016,Examining the specificity of the seductive allure effect,"Previous work has found that people feel significantly more satisfied with explanations of psychological phenomena when those explanations contain neuroscience information — even when this information is entirely irrelevant to the logic of the explanations. This seductive allure effect was first demonstrated by Weisberg, Keil, Goodstein, Rawson, & Gray (2008), and has since been replicated several times in independent labs (e.g., Fernandez-Duque, Evans, Christian, & Hodges, 2014; Rhodes, Rodriguez, & Shah, 2014; Weisberg, Taylor, & Hopkins, 2015). However, these studies only examined psychological explanations with added neuroscience information. The current study thus investigated the generality of this effect and found that the seductive allure effect occurs across several scientific disciplines whenever the explanations include reference to smaller components or more fundamental processes. These data suggest that people have a general preference for reductive explanations.",>Emily Hopkins>Deena Weisberg>Jordan Taylor,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0320/index.html
2016,More than Words: The Many Ways Extended Discourse Facilitates Word Learning,"Child-directed speech is often temporally organized such that successive utterances refer to the same topic. This type of extended discourse on the same referent has been shown to possess several verbal signatures that could facilitate learning. Here, we reveal multiple non-verbal correlates to extended discourse that could also aid learning. Multimodal analyses of extended discourse episodes reveal that during these episodes, toddlers and parents exhibit greater sustained attention on objects, and greater coordination between their behaviors. The results indicate the interconnections between multiple aspects of the language-learning environment, and suggest that parents’ speech may both shape and be shaped by non-verbal processes.

2016,Two Potential Mechanisms Underlying the Link between Approximate Number Representations and Symbolic Math in Preschool Children,"The approximate number system (ANS) is frequently considered to be a foundation for the acquisition of uniquely human symbolic numerical capabilities. However, the mechanism by which the ANS influences symbolic number representations and mathematical thought remains poorly understood. Here, we tested the relation between ANS acuity, cardinal number knowledge, approximate arithmetic, and symbolic math achievement in a one-year longitudinal investigation of preschoolers’ early math abilities. Our results suggest that cardinal number knowledge is an intermediary factor in the relation between ANS acuity and symbolic math achievement. Furthermore, approximate arithmetic performance contributes unique variance to math achievement that is not accounted for by ANS acuity. These findings suggest that there are multiple routes by which the ANS influences math achievement. Therefore, interventions targeting both the precision and manipulability of the ANS may prove to be more beneficial for improving mathematical reasoning compared to interventions targeting only one of these factors.",>Ariel Starr>Rachel Roberts>Elizabeth Brannon,">University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0322/index.html
2016,Construal level affects intuitive moral responses to narrative content,"This study proposes that moral judgments of media content are not only related to intuitive moral domain salience and exemplars, but also to the processing state of the individual at the moment of exposure. An experiment manipulating construal level prior to exposure to a narrative text was conducted to test this proposal. The results suggest that evaluations of moral violations are modulated by construal level. High-level construal led to harsher, more consistent judgments of domain-violator morality, eliminating the effect of baseline moral intuitions. Low-level construal induced an apparent trade-off in moral evaluation strategy which is sensitive to both narrative outcome and domain salience. When domain violators were punished, intuitive moral salience was negatively correlated with moral evaluations; however, when domain violators were rewarded, the opposite trend emerged. These findings suggest that the strength and quality of moral intuitions are not robust to broader cognitive processes, but interact with them.",>Nicholas Lester>René Weber,">University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, USA>University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0323/index.html

Two accounts of why people violate independence are formalized and subjected to experimental test. Subjects’ inferences were more consistent with a dual prototype model in which people favor network states in which variables are all present or all absent than a leaky gate model in which information is transmitted through network nodes when it should normatively be blocked. The article concludes with a call for theories of causal cognition that rest on foundations that are faithful to the kinds of causal inferences people actually draw.",>Bob Rehder,>NYU,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0324/index.html
2016,Curiosity-Driven Development of Tool Use Precursors: a Computational Model,"Studies of child development of tool use precursors show successive but overlapping phases of qualitatively different types of behaviours. We hypothesize that two mechanisms in particular play a role in the structuring of these phases: the intrinsic motivation to explore and the representation used to encode sensorimotor experience. Previous models showed how curiosity-driven learning mechanisms could allow the emergence of developmental trajectories. We build upon those models and present the HACOB (Hierarchical Active Curiosity-driven mOdel Babbling) architecture that actively chooses which sensorimotor model to train in a hierarchy of models representing the environmental structure. We study this architecture using a simulated robotic arm in a 2D environment. We show that overlapping phases of behaviours are autonomously emerging in hierarchical models using active model babbling. To our knowledge, this is the first model of curiosity-driven development of simple tool use and of the self-organization of overlapping phases of behaviours.",>Sébastien Forestier>Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,">Inria Bordeaux and Université de Bordeaux, France>Inria Bordeaux and Ensta-ParisTech, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0325/index.html

Spatial memory can improve foraging efficacy, and evidence indicates that many species actively utilize spatial memory to aid in their foraging, yet most current models of foraging do not include spatial memory. In this study, an online game was used to replicate and extend findings from a recent study to investigate the role of spatial memory in foraging. The game involved searching a 2d space to find as many resources as possible. Spatial information was displayed that provided complete information about search history in order test how “perfect” spatial memory improves search performance. Over 1000 participants were recruited to participate using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which allowed this test to be performed across a wide range of different resource distributions. Results replicated the findings of earlier studies, and demonstrated that spatial memory can have a dramatic effect on search performance.",>Bryan Kerster>Chris Kello,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0326/index.html

The characteristics of these gestures give information regarding the mental timelines people form to experience time. The present study investigates the expression of temporal concepts on a natural setting with Turkish speakers. We found that Turkish speakers used more metaphoric temporal phrases (e.g., short period) than words referring to time without spatial content (e.g., today) in a session where they talked about people’s fortune. Spontaneous gestures were mainly classified as metaphoric and beat gestures and were mostly produced on the sagittal axis, which contradicts with the previous findings. Yet, we also found that people used vertical axis to represent current and future events. These findings suggest that lateral axis may not always be the most common direction for co-speech temporal gesture use, and the pragmatic constraints of the environment may influence the spatial conceptualization of time.",>İdil Bostan>Ahmet Börütecene>Oğuzhan Özcan>Tilbe Goksun,">Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey>Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey>Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey>Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0327/index.html
2016,Children’s Awareness of Authority to Change Rules in Various Social Contexts,"To investigate children’s awareness of authority to change rules, we showed children (ages 4-7) videos of one child playing a game alone or three children playing a game together. In the group video, the game rule was initiated either: by one of the children, by three children collaboratively or by an adult. They then were asked whether the characters in the videos could change the rules. Children believed that the character could change the rule when playing alone. Their responses to the group video depended on how the rule was initiated. They attributed authority to change rules only to the child who initiated the rule, unless the rule was created collaboratively. We also asked children whether they could change norms (school/moral/artifact norms) in daily life; and found moral/artifact distinction in children’s endorsement of norm changing. These results suggest that children recognize flexibility in changing rules even in preschool years.",>Xin Zhao>Tamar Kushnir,">Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States>Cornell University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0328/index.html

The model assumes the probability of retrieving a chunk of information about an object and the time to retrieve this information depend on the pattern of prior environmental exposure to the object. Second, we use frequencies of information appearing on the Internet as a proxy for what information people would encounter in their natural environment, outside the laboratory. In two Experiments, we use this model to account for subjects’ associative knowledge about real-world objects as well as the associated retrieval latencies. Third, in a computer simulation, we explore how such model predictions can be used to understand the workings and performance of decision strategies that operate on the contents of declarative memory.",>Daniela Link>Julian N.

2016,Conversational expectations account for apparent limits on theory of mind use,"Theory of mind is a powerful cognitive ability: by the age of six, people are capable of accurately reasoning about others' beliefs and desires. An influential series of language understanding experiments by Keysar and colleagues, however, showed that adults systematically failed to take a speaker's beliefs into account, revealing limitations on theory of mind. In this paper we argue that these apparent failures are in fact successes. Through a minimal pair of replications comparing scripted vs. unscripted speakers, we show that critical utterances used by Keysar and colleagues are uncooperative: they are less informative than what a speaker would actually produce in that situation. When we allow participants to naturally interact, we find that listener expectations are justified and errors are reduced. This ironically shows that apparent failures of theory of mind are in fact attributable to sophisticated expectations about speaker behavior---that is, to theory of mind.",>Robert X.d.

One would expect that an utterance today would be more informative than an utterance 100 years ago (basing information on surprisal; Shannon 1948), given the increase in technology and scientific discoveries. This prediction, however, is at odds with recent theories regarding information in human language use, which suggest that speakers maintain a somewhat constant information rate over time. Using the Google Ngram corpus (Michel et al. 2011), we show for multiple languages that changes in lexical information (a unigram model) are actually negatively correlated with changes in structural information (a trigram model), supporting recent proposals on information theoretic constraints.",>Uriel Cohen Priva>Emily Gleason,">Brown University, Providence, RI, United States>Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0331/index.html

However, previous studies adopted the artificial grammar learning paradigm and did not apply natural language stimuli. Accordingly, we attempt to tighten the link between artificial language learning and natural language acquisition in the auditory modality, by enriching our learning environment with phonological cues that occur in natural language, namely, spoken information, in particular, Chinese tones. In a grammaticality judgment task, we examined the syntactical processing by participants from different language backgrounds. Through the cross-language comparison between Chinese and Dutch native speakers, we aim to test the influence of language-specific phonological cues on processing complex linguistic structures. The results showed that tones had a more beneficial learning effect on Chinese than on Dutch participants. When participants learned a new language, they were likely to bring their own language routines implicitly from the familiar native language into processing the unfamiliar one.",>Jun Lai>Chiara de Jong>Dingguo Gao>Ren Huang>Emiel Krahmer>Jan Sprenger,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Sun Yat-Sen University>Sun Yat-Sen University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0332/index.html

However these methods typically generate group-level networks, and sometimes require a very large amount of participant data.

In both individual and joint conditions, participants were slower to respond, and were differentially attracted to the distracter response location, when the spatial component of the stimulus was incompatible with the response location. When two people completed similar two choice tasks together, the results were not statistically different from the individual condition, even though the magnitude of the stimulus-response compatibility effect was slightly larger. Neither was there an increased effect when the partner had no stimulus-response conflict to resolve. We found no evidence for an action conflict when the responses of the two partners were different. These data imply that the literature regarding the Joint Simon task is still in the process of determining the relevant events that interact with and support joint action.",>Steve Croker>J.

We use this method to evaluate two speaker normalization algorithms against human data. Simulations show that representations that are normalized across speakers predict human discrimination data better than unnormalized representations, consistent with previous research. Results further reveal differences across normalization methods in how well each predicts human data.

2016,Facilitating Spatial Task Learning in Interactive Multimedia Environments While Accounting for Individual Differences and Task Difficulty,"Two experiments examined the effects of interactive tutorial features (compared to “passive” features) on learning spatial tasks, an area seldom explored in interactivity research. Experiment 1 results indicated that for simple spatial tasks, interactive tutorials hindered learning for participants of higher spatial ability but improved learning for lower-ability participants. This interaction can be explained by “compensation,” the notion that people of higher ability can compensate for poor external support (passive tutorials) while people of lower ability need the better support. It is likely that the increased cognitive load of interactivity (Kalyuga, 2007) hindered high-spatial participants on a relatively easy task. In Experiment 2, task difficulty was increased, and the results revealed that the interactive tutorial produced better learning than the passive tutorial, regardless of spatial abilities. With the relatively difficult task, the benefits of interactivity became clearer because most people actually needed the interactive features despite the associated cognitive load.",>Dar-Wei Chen>Richard Catrambone,">Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America>Georgia Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0336/index.html

A pervasively neural account of this process requires that fundamental problems are solved: the neural pointer problem, the binding problem, and the problem of generating discrete processing steps from time-continuous neural processes. We present a prototypical solution to these problems in a neural dynamic model that comprises dynamic neural fields holding representations close to sensorimotor surfaces as well as dynamic nodes holding discrete, language-like representations. Making the connection between these two types of representations enables the model to parse actions as well as ground movement phrases - all based on real visual input.

We find that the associations between the words and phrases that constitute these events, as assessed by vector space semantic models, strongly correlate with the probabilities assigned to these events by participants. Thus, for example, the semantic proximity of “earthquake” and “Japan” accurately predicts judgments regarding the probability of an earthquake in Japan. Our results suggest that the mechanisms and representations at play in language are also active in high-level domains, such as judgment and decision making, and that existing insights regarding these representations can be used to make precise, quantitative, a priori predictions regarding the probability estimates of individuals.",>Sudeep Bhatia,>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0338/index.html

We find that zero-mean and symmetrically distributed noise in the underlying parameters of these models can systematically distort choice probabilities, leading to false conclusions. Likewise, differences in choice proportions across decision makers might be due to differences in the amount of noise affecting underlying parameters rather than to differences in actual parameter values. Our results suggest that care and caution are needed when trying to infer the underlying preferences of decision makers, or the effects of psychological, biological, economic, and demographic variables on these preferences.",>Sudeep Bhatia>Graham Loomes,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0339/index.html

In the experiment reported here, participants completed long sums either with hands down—the low interactivity condition—or by moving numbered tokens—the high interactivity condition—while they repeated ‘the’ continuously, loading the phonological loop, or not. As expected articulatory suppression substantially affected performance, but more so in the low interactivity condition. Independent measures of basic arithmetic skill and mathematics anxiety moderated the impact of articulatory suppression on performance in the low but not in the high interactivity condition.

The aim of this study is to explore these differences between languages in relation to the categorization differences within a language. Monolingual Dutch- (N=400) and French-speaking (N=300) Belgian adults provided lexical category judgments for three lexical categories that are roughly equivalent in Dutch and French. Each category was represented by good, borderline, and bad examples. A mixture modeling approach enabled us to identify latent groups of categorizers within a language and to evaluate cross-linguistic variation in relation to within-language variation. We found complex patterns of lexical variation within as well as between language groups. Even within a seemingly homogeneous group of speakers sharing the same mother tongue, latent groups of categorizers display a variability that resembles patterns of lexical variation found at a cross-linguistic level of comparison.",>Anne White>Gert Storms>Barbara C.

Recent research has uncovered a host of biases that afflict explanatory inference: Would these biases also translate into decision-making? We find that although people show biased inferences when making explanatory judgments in decision-relevant contexts (Exp. 1A), these biases are attenuated or eliminated when the choice context is highlighted by introducing an economic framing (price information; Exp. 1B–1D). However, biased inferences can be “locked in” to subsequent decisions when the judgment and decision are separated in time (Exp. 2). Together, these results suggest that decisions can be more rational than the corresponding judgments—leading to choices that are rational in the output of the decision process, yet irrational in their incoherence with judgments.",>Samuel Johnson>Marianna Zhang>Frank Keil,">Yale University, New Haven, CT>University of Chicago, Chicago, IL>Yale University, New Haven, CT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0343/index.html
2016,Does Chess Instruction Enhance Mathematical Ability in Children? A Three-Group Design to Control for Placebo Effects,"Pupils’ poor achievement in mathematics has recently been a concern in many countries. To address this issue, it has been proposed to teach chess in schools. However, no convincing evidence of the benefits of chess instruction has ever been provided, because no study has ever controlled for placebo effects. This study implemented a three-group design to control for placebo effects. Measures of mathematical and metacognitive skills were taken. The results showed that the chess-treated group achieved better scores in mathematics than the placebo group (attending a Go course) but not than the control group (attending regular school lessons). Regarding metacognition, no differences occurred between the groups. These results suggest that some chess-related skills generalize to mathematics, because chess compensated for the hours of school lessons lost, whereas Go did not. However, this transfer is not mediated by metacognitive skills, and appears to be too limited to offer educational advantages.",>Giovanni Sala>Fernand Gobet>Roberto Trinchero>Salvatore Ventura,">University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom>University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom>University of Turin, Italy>University of Milan, Italy",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0344/index.html

A Study in Mental Disorders and Non-Causal Explanation,"Three experiments investigate whether and why people accept explanations for symptoms that appeal to mental disorders, such as: “She experiences delusions because she has schizophrenia.” Such explanations are potentially puzzling, as mental disorder diagnoses are made on the basis of symptoms rather than causes. Do laypeople nonetheless conceptualize mental disorder classifications in causal terms? Or is this an instance of non-causal explanation? Experiment 1 shows that such explanations are found explanatory. Experiment 2 presents participants with novel disorders that are stipulated to involve or not involve an underlying cause across symptoms and people. Disorder classifications are found more explanatory when a causal basis is stipulated, or when participants infer that one is present (even after it’s denied in the text). Finally, Experiment 3 finds that merely having a principled, but non-causal, basis for defining symptom clusters is insufficient to reach the explanatory potential of categories with a stipulated common cause.",>Daniel Wilkenfeld>Jennifer Asselin>Tania Lombrozo,>UC Berkeley>The Ohio State University>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0345/index.html

Knowing that someone likes the same things as you do is indicative of broader underlying similarities that support successful social partnerships. However, not all overlaps in preferences are equally informative. Here we propose that the rarity of overlaps in preferences may be a particularly salient cue for social affiliation. We find evidence that people are sensitive to the rarity of overlaps in preferences and affiliate themselves (Experiment 1) or predict others' affiliations (Experiment 2) with potential social partners who share a relatively rare preference. Because preferences provide information about both what people know and what they like, we also tested the effect of overlaps in knowledge (without taste) and overlaps in taste (without knowledge) to understand why we are drawn to people who share our preferences.",>Natalia Vélez>Sophie Bridgers>Hyowon Gweon,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0346/index.html

The phenomenon of causal illusions raises problems for such views. Causal illusions arise when a particular factor is perceived to be causal despite knowledge indicating otherwise. According to what we will call the Dual-Process Hypothesis of Causal Identification, identifying a cause involves two cognitive processes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that in response to a causal illusion shown in a naturalistic setting, people’s initial judgments of causation were higher than their ultimate judgments of causation (Experiment 1). Using an online measure of decisions, we found that people initially view animations of causal illusions as causal before concluding that they are non-causal (Experiment 2). Finally, we obtained similar results using a deadline procedure (Experiment 3). Implications for different classes of theories of causation are discussed.",>Robert Thorstad>Phillip Wolff,>Emory University>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0347/index.html

However, to extract fine-grained interaction patterns in social contexts has been presented with methodological challenges. Cross-Recurrence Plot Quantification Analysis (CRQA) is an analysis method invented in theoretical physics and recently applied to cognitive science to study interpersonal coordination. In this paper, we extend this approach to analyzing joint activities in child-parent interaction. We define a new representation as Cross Recurrence Block based on CRQA. With this representation, we are able to capture interpersonal dynamics from more than two behavioral streams in one Cross Recurrence Plot and derive a suite of measures to quantify detailed characteristics of coordination. Using a dataset collected from child-parent interaction, we show that these quantitative measures of joint activities reveal developmental changes in coordinative behavioral patterns between children and parents.",>Tian Xu>Chen Yu,">Computer Science and Cognitive Science Department, Indiana University Bloomington>Psychological & Brain Sciences, Cognitive Sciences, and informatics Department, Indiana University Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0348/index.html
2016,Temporal Horizons and Decision-Making: A Big Data Approach,"Human behavior is plagued by shortsightedness. When faced with two options, smaller rewards are often chosen over larger rewards, even when such choices are potentially costly. In three experiments, we use big data techniques to examine how such choices might be driven by people’s temporal horizons. In Experiment 1, we determine the average distance into the future people talk about in their tweets in order to determine the temporal horizon of each U.S. state. States with further future horizons had lower rates of risk taking. In Experiment 2, we used an individual’s tweets to establish their temporal horizon and found that those with longer temporal horizons were more willing to wait for larger rewards. In Experiment 3, we show with tweets that those with longer future horizons were less likely to take risks. The findings help establish a powerful relationship between people’s thoughts about the future and their decisions.",>Robert Thorstad>Phillip Wolff,>Emory University>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0349/index.html

Using subgoal learning, which has promoted retention and transfer in procedural domains, the study compared the efficacy of different methods for learning a programming procedure. The results suggest that constructive methods produced better problem solving performance than passive or active methods. The amount of instructional support that learners received in the three different constructive interventions also affected performance. Learners performed best when they either received hints about the subgoals of the procedure or received feedback on the subgoal labels that they constructed, but not when they received both. These findings suggest that constructing subgoal labels is better than passively or actively engaging with subgoal labels. Furthermore, there is an optimal level of instructional support for students engaging in constructive learning and that providing too much support can be equally as detrimental as providing too little support.",>Lauren Margulieux>Richard Catrambone,>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0350/index.html
2016,The Effects of Gender Stereotypes for Structure Mapping in Mathematics,"Fear of a negative stereotype about one’s performance can lead to temporary underperformance on tests; e.g. women may underperform on a math test when prompted to think about gender. The current study extends this literature to examine whether stereotype threat not only leads to underperformance on tests, but also may impact reasoning and learning more broadly. We focus in particular on the effects of stereotype threat on analogical learning, a complex reasoning process that imposes a high working memory load. In this study, we examined the effects of gender stereotypes when females were asked to learn by comparing the mathematical concepts of combinations and permutations. Overall, participants given a threat before learning gained less from the instruction, as reflected by assessments administered immediately after the lesson and after a 1-week delay. This could lead to systematic differences in the quality of abstract representational knowledge for individuals from negatively stereotyped groups.",>Kreshnik Begolli>Brooke Herd>Hannah Sayonno>Susanne Jaeggi>Lindsey Richland,">Temple University>University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine>University of Chicago",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0351/index.html
2016,Improving with Practice: A Neural Model of Mathematical Development,"The ability to improve in speed and accuracy as a result of repeating some task is an important hallmark of intelligent biological systems. We model the progression from a counting-based strategy for addition to a recall-based strategy. The model consists of two networks working in parallel: a slower basal ganglia loop, and a faster cortical network. The slow network methodically computes the count from one digit given another, corresponding to the addition of two digits, while the fast network gradually ""memorizes"" the output from the slow network. The faster network eventually learns how to add the same digits that initially drove the behaviour of the slower network. Performance of this model is demonstrated by simulating a fully spiking neural network that includes basal ganglia, thalamus and various cortical areas.",>Sean Aubin>Aaron Voelker>Chris Eliasmith,">University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0352/index.html
2016,Examining Referential Uncertainty in Naturalistic Contexts from the Child’s View: Evidence from an Eye-Tracking Study with Infants,"Young Infants are prolific word learners even though they are facing the challenge of referential uncertainty (Quine, 1960). Many laboratory studies have shown that infants are skilled at inferring correct referents of words from ambiguous contexts (Swingley, 2009). However, little is known regarding how they visually attend to and select the target object among many other objects in view when parents name it during everyday interactions. By investigating the looking pattern of 12-month-old infants using naturalistic first-person images with varying degrees of referential ambiguity, we found that infants’ attention is selective and they only select a small subset of objects to attend to at each learning instance despite the complexity of the data in the real world. This work allows us to better understand how perceptual properties of objects in infants’ view influence their visual attention, which is also related to how they select candidate objects to build word-object mappings.",>Yayun Zhang>Chen Yu,">Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA>Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0353/index.html
2016,The Naïve Utility Calculus unifies spatial and statistical routes to preference,"Humans can seamlessly infer what other people like, based on what they do. Broadly, two types of accounts have been proposed to explain different aspects of this ability. A first account focuses on inferences from spatial information: agents choose and move towards things they like. A second account focuses on inferences from statistical information: uncommon choices reveal preferences more clearly compared to common choices. Here we argue that these two kinds of inferences can be explained by the assumption that agents maximize utilities. We test this idea in a task where adult participants infer an agent’s preferences using a combination of spatial and statistical information. We show that our model predicts human answers with higher accuracy than a set of plausible alternative models.",>Julian Jara-Ettinger>Felix Sun>Laura Schulz>Josh Tenenbaum,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>MIT>MIT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0354/index.html
2016,Task-set Selection in Probabilistic Environments: a Model of Task-set Inference,"To act effectively in a complicated, uncertain world, people often rely on task-sets (TSs) that define action policies over a range of stimuli. Effectively selecting amongst TSs requires assessing their individual utility given the current world state. However, the world state is, in general, latent, stochastic, and time-varying, making TS selection a difficult inference for the agent. An open question is how observable environmental factors influence an actor's assessment of the world state and thus the selection of TSs. We designed a novel task in which probabilistic cues predict one of two TSs on a trial-by-trial basis. With this task, we investigate how people integrate multiple sources of probabilistic information in the service of TS selection. We show that when action feedback is unavailable, TS selection can be modeled as “biased Bayesian inference”, such that individuals participants differentially weight immediate cues over TS priors when inferring the latent world state.",>Ian W.

Recent simulations with a model of word meaning suggest that N400 amplitudes reflect implicit semantic prediction error. Here, we extend these simulations to sentence comprehension, using a model of sentence processing to simulate a number of N400 effects obtained in empirical research. In the model, sequentially incoming words update a representation capturing probabilities of elements of sentence meaning, not only reflecting the constituents presented so far, but also the model’s best guess at all features of the sentence meaning based on the statistical regularities in its environment. Across a series of simulations, the update of the predictive representation of sentence meaning consistently patterned with N400 amplitudes, in line with the idea that N400 amplitudes reflect semantic surprise as the change in the probability distribution over semantic features in an integrated representation of meaning.",>Milena Rabovsky>Steven S.

While recent research has suggested common principles underlying human and machine “active learning,” the existing literature has focused on relatively simple types of queries. In this paper, we study how humans construct rich and sophisticated natural language queries to search for information in a large yet computationally tractable hypothesis space. In Experiment 1, participants were allowed to ask any question they liked in natural language. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to evaluate questions that they did not generate themselves. While people rarely asked the most informative questions in Experiment 1, they strongly preferred more informative questions in Experiment 2, as predicted by an ideal Bayesian analysis. Our results show that rigorous information-based accounts of human question asking are more widely applicable than previously studied, explaining preferences across a diverse set of natural language questions.",>Anselm Rothe>Brenden Lake>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0357/index.html

The assumption has been that sequential images provide a fairly universal and transparent stimuli that require little to no learning to decode, and thus are ideal for non-verbal tasks in developmental, clinical, and non-literate populations. However, decades of cross-cultural and developmental research have actually suggested something different: that sequential image comprehension is contingent on exposure and practice with a graphic system.

2016,Deciding to Remember: Memory Maintenance as a Markov Decision Process,"Working memory is a limited-capacity form of human memory that actively holds information in mind. Which memories ought to be maintained? We approach this question by showing an equivalence between active maintenance in working memory and a Markov decision process in which, at each moment, a cognitive control mechanism selects a memory as the target of maintenance. The challenge of remembering is to find a suitable maintenance policy. We compute the optimal policy under various conditions and define plausible cognitive mechanisms that can approximate them. Framing the problem of maintenance in this way makes it possible to capture in a single model many of the essential behavioral phenomena of memory maintenance, including directed forgetting and self-directed remembering. Finally, we consider the case of imperfect metamemory — where the current state of memory is only partially observable — and show that the fidelity of metamemory determines the effectiveness of maintenance.",>Jordan W.

2016,When to Block versus Interleave Practice? Evidence Against Teaching Fraction Addition before Fraction Multiplication,"In practice, mathematics education is blocked (i.e., teaching one topic at a time; CCSS, 2010), but research generally promotes interleaving (i.e., teaching multiple topics together; Rohrer & Taylor, 2007). For example, fraction arithmetic is blocked with students being taught fraction addition before fraction multiplication. Since students often confuse fraction operations to produce arithmetic errors, interleaved fraction arithmetic instruction might be more productive than blocked instruction to teach students to discriminate between the operations. Additionally, a cognitive task analysis suggests that fraction multiplication may be a prerequisite to fraction addition and thus reversing the blocking order may enhance learning. Two experiments with fraction addition and fraction multiplication were run. Experiments 1 and 2 show that interleaved instruction is generally better than the current blocked instruction. Experiment 2 provides evidence that blocking that reverses the standard order -- providing practice on fraction multiplication before fraction addition -- produces better learning.",>Rony Patel>Ran Liu>Kenneth Koedinger,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0360/index.html
2016,Helping people make better decisions using optimal gamification,"Game elements like points and levels are a popular tool to nudge and engage students and customers. Yet, no theory can tell us which incentive structures work and how to design them. Here we connect the practice of gamification to the theory of reward shaping in reinforcement learning. We leverage this connection to develop a method for designing effective incentive structures and delineating when gamification will succeed from when it will fail. We evaluate our method in two behavioral experiments. The results of the first experiment demonstrate that incentive structures designed by our method help people make better, less short-sighted decisions and avoid the pitfalls of less principled approaches. The results of the second experiment illustrate that such incentive structures can be effectively implemented using game elements like points and badges. These results suggest that our method provides a principled way to leverage gamification to help people make better decisions.",>Falk Lieder>Tom Griffiths,">University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0361/index.html
2016,Learning biases may prevent lexicalization of pragmatic inferences: a case study combining iterated (Bayesian) learning and functional selection,Natural languages exhibit properties that are difficult to explain from a purely functional perspective. One of these properties is the systematic lack of upper-bounds in the literal meaning of scalar expressions. This investigation addresses the development and selection of such semantics from a space of possible alternatives. To do so we put forward a model that integrates Bayesian learning into the replicator-mutator dynamics commonly used in evolutionary game theory. We argue this synthesis to provide a suitable and general model to analyze the dynamics involved in the use and transmission of language. Our results shed light on the semantics-pragmatics divide and show how a learning bias in tandem with functional pressure may prevent the lexicalization of pragmatic inferences.,>Thomas Brochhagen>Michael Franke>Robert van Rooij,>University of Amsterdam>University of Tübingen>University of Amsterdam,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0362/index.html
2016,A Computational Model of Perceptual Deficits in Medial Temporal Lobe Amnesia,"Damage to the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) impairs declarative memory and perception. The Representational-Hierarchical (RH) Account explains such impairments by assuming that MTL stores conjunctive representations of items and events, and that individuals with MTL damage must rely upon representations of simple visual features in posterior visual cortex. A recent study revealed a surprising anti-perceptual learning effect in MTL-damaged individuals: with exposure to a set of visual stimuli, discrimination performance worsened rather than improved. We expand the RH account to explain this paradox by assuming that visual discrimination is performed using a familiarity heuristic. Exposure to a set of highly similar stimuli entails repeated presentation of simple visual features, eventually rendering all feature representations equally (maximally) familiar and hence inutile for solving the task. Since the unique conjunctions represented in MTL do not occur repeatedly, healthy individuals are shielded from perceptual interference. We simulate this mechanism with a neural network.",>Patrick Sadil>Rosemary A.

2016,Linguistic input is tuned to children’s developmental level,"Children rapidly learn a tremendous amount about language despite limitations imposed on them by their developing cognitive abilities. One possible explanation for this rapid learning is that caregivers tune the language they produce to these limitations, titrating the complexity of their speech to developmentally-appropriate levels. We test this hypothesis in a large-scale corpus analysis, measuring the contingency between parents’ and children’s speech over the first 5 years. Our results support the linguistic tuning hypothesis, showing a high degree of mostly parent-led coordination early in development that decreases as children become more proficient language learners and users.",>Daniel Yurovsky>Gabriel Doyle>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0364/index.html
2016,The Plausible Impossible: Causal Constraints on Magical Reasoning,"A common intuition, often captured in fiction, is that some impossible events (e.g., levitating a stone) are “more impossible” than others (e.g., levitating a feather). We investigated the source of this intuition, hypothesizing that it arises from explanatory considerations logically precluded by the violation at hand but still taken into account. In Study 1, adults saw pairs of magical events (spells) that violated one of 18 causal principles and were asked to indicate which would be more difficult to learn. Both spells violated the same causal principle but differed in their relation to a subsidiary principle. Participants’ judgments of spell difficulty consistently honored the subsidiary principle. Study 2 replicated the effects of Study 1 with Likert-type ratings, and Study 3 replicated those effects in children. These findings suggest that events that defy causal explanation are interpreted in terms of explanatory considerations that hold in the absence of such violations.",>Andrew Shtulman>Caitlin Morgan,>Occidental College>Occidental College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0365/index.html

We found that individuals with a stronger statistical learning sensitivity showed a larger effect of conditional word probability on word reading times, indicating that they more efficiently incorporated statistical regularities of the language during reading.

In Experiment 1, we presented children with base-rate and individuating information separately to test their ability to use each independently. In Experiment 2, we presented children with base-rate and individuating information together.

Language acquisition in turn is heavily influenced by environmental factors such as socioeconomic status (SES). However, it is unknown to what extent SL abilities interact with SES in affecting language outcomes. To examine this potential interaction, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) in 38 children aged 7-12 while performing a visual SL task consisting of a sequence of stimuli that contained covert statistical probabilities that predicted a target stimulus. Hierarchical regression results indicated that SL ability moderated the relationship between SES (average of both caregiver’s education level) and language scores (grammar, and marginally with receptive vocabulary). For children with high SL ability, SES had a weaker effect on language compared to children with low SL ability, suggesting that having good SL abilities could help ameliorate the disadvantages associated with being raised in a family with lower SES.",>Leyla Eghbalzad>Joanne Deocampo>Christopher Conway,">Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia (GA), United States>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0370/index.html

We found that the most original concepts were produced when the concept originator was the top contributor to the design, and when the majority of group members contributed to the concept, particularly among senior students.

2016,There is more to gesture than meets the eye: Visual attention to gesture’s referents cannot account for its facilitative effects during math instruction,"Teaching a new concept with gestures – hand movements that accompany speech – facilitates learning above-and-beyond instruction through speech alone (e.g., Singer & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still being explored. Here, we use eye tracking to explore one mechanism – gesture’s ability to direct visual attention. We examine how children allocate their visual attention during a mathematical equivalence lesson that either contains gesture or does not. We show that gesture instruction improves posttest performance, and additionally that gesture does change how children visually attend to instruction: children look more to the problem being explained, and less to the instructor. However looking patterns alone cannot explain gesture’s effect, as posttest performance is not predicted by any of our looking-time measures. These findings suggest that gesture does guide visual attention, but that attention alone cannot account for its facilitative learning effects.",>Miriam Novack>Elizabeth Wakefield>Eliza Congdon>Steve Franconeri>Susan Goldin-Meadow,">The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois>The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois>The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois>Northwestern University>The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0372/index.html

In the second experiment, we compared SRP and non-SRP in two tasks equalized in semantic processing but using different words. In both experiments recall performance was significantly lower after SRP compared to non-SRP, indicating that SRP has a disruptive effect on the recall task. A cognitive model implemented in PRIMs, using goal competition during SRP, interfering with rehearsal of letters, could account for the observed experimental results.

However such instructions are non-explicit and vague, and might encourage a strategy other than a categorical decision. The present experiment used the same triads as in Shipp et al. to test whether participants were actually engaging in a categorisation strategy. The task instructions were manipulated so that participants either selected the item that “goes best”, “goes best to form a category” or is “most similar” to the target. The results found no differences between the instructions of “goes best to form a category” and “goes best”. Therefore the triad task does encourage a natural categorisation strategy and differences in task instructions across research are a result of the stimuli used.",>Nicholas Shipp>Frederic Vallee-Tourangeau>Susan Anthony,">University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom>Kingston University>University of Hertfordshire",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0374/index.html

Preschoolers (N = 81) participated in a 5-minute interaction with an adult in which they were asked to talk about events in the near future, distant future, near past, or present. Compared with children discussing their present and distant future, children asked to discuss events in their near future or near past displayed better planning and prospective memory.

Reasoners appear to reason using different strategies. A complete account of syllogisms must explain them and the resulting differences from one individual to another. We propose a dual-process theory that solves these two problems. It is based on the manipulation of mental models, i.e., iconic simulations of possibilities. A computer program implementing the theory, mReasoner, generates initial conclusions by building and scanning models. The theory accounts for individual differences in an early study on syllogisms (Johnson-Laird & Steedman, 1978). The computational model provides an algorithmic account of the different processes on which three subsets of performance relied (Simulation 1). It also simulates the performance of each individual participant in the study (Simulation 2).

2016,Grounded Distributional Semantics for Abstract Words,"Since Harnad (1990) pointed out the symbol grounding problem, cognitive science research has demonstrated that grounding in perceptual or sensorimotor experience is crucial to language. Recent embodied cognition theories have argued that language is more important for grounding abstract than concrete words; abstract words are grounded via language. Distributional semantics has recently addressed the embodied nature of language and proposed multimodal semantic models. However, these models are not cognitively plausible because they do not address the recent embodiment view of abstract concepts. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal distributional semantics in which abstract words are represented indirectly through grounded representations of their semantically related concrete words. A simulation experiment demonstrated that the proposed model achieved better performance in computing the word similarity than other multimodal or text-based distributional models. This finding suggests that the indirect embodiment view is plausible and contributes to the improvement of multimodal distributional semantics.",>Katsumi Takano>Akira Utsumi,>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0377/index.html

This study extends previous results showing learning from overhearing simplified, pedagogic speech to a more ecologically valid context. Children learn multiple words and facts corresponding to novel toys either through an overheard phone call or through direct instruction. Remarkably, 4.5–6-year-olds learned four new words equally well in both conditions. Their performance on a set of six facts was even better, especially when taught directly. Analysis of the videos revealed that older children with high test accuracy both looked toward the experimenter often, and tracked objects as she discussed them. 3–4.5-year-olds only learned facts from overhearing, and exhibited greater varability in attention. These results suggest learning from overhearing is driven by attention to the indirect input, and may be a skill that undergoes substantial development during the preschool years.",>Ruthe Foushee>Fei Xu,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0378/index.html

Recently, Choi, Chang, Shibata, Sasaki, and Watanabe (2012) have shown that a short, one-hour training can eliminate this ""attentional blink"". Up to now, it is still unclear why this training works. In this paper, we have evaluated a range of different training paradigms to test several hypotheses about the mechanism behind the reduction of the attentional blink. Our results show that none of these training paradigms have a large training effect when administered in isolation. The training by Choi et al. (2012) outperforms them all.

In three experiments, we investigated whether learners deploy attention to novel auditory features when learning novel words in a similar fashion to the prevailing visual categorization findings.

When instructed to make separate responses to auditory and visual oddballs, visual dominance was found with cross-modal presentation slowing down response times and decreasing auditory accuracy. However, examination of cardiac responses that were time-locked to stimulus onset show cross-modal facilitation effects, with discrimination of oddballs and standards occurring earlier in the course of processing in the cross-modal condition than in the unimodal conditions.

In parallel, connectionist modeling has extended our knowledge of the processes engaged in semantic activation. However, these two lines of investigation have rarely brought together. Here, starting from a standard textual model of semantics, we allow activation to spread throughout its associated semantic network, as dictated by the patterns of semantic similarity between words.

2016,Evolution of polysemous word senses from metaphorical mappings,"What forces have shaped the evolution of the lexicon? Languages evolve under the pressure of having to communicate an unbounded set of ideas using a finite set of linguistic structures. This suggests why the transmission of ideas should be compressed such that one word will develop multiple senses. Previous theory also suggests how a word might develop new senses: Abstract concepts may be construed in terms of more concrete concepts. Here, we bring these two perspectives together to examine metaphorical extensions of English word meanings over the past millennium, analyzing how senses from a source domain are extended to new ones in a target domain. Using empirical and computational methods, we found that metaphorical mappings are highly systematic and can be explained in terms of a compact set of variables. Our work shows how metaphor can provide a cognitive device for compressing emerging ideas into an existing lexicon.",>Yang Xu>Barbara Malt>Mahesh Srinivasan,>UC Berkeley>Lehigh University>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0384/index.html
2016,Using Violations of Fitts’ Law to Communicate during Joint Action,"When people perform joint actions together, task knowledge is sometimes distributed asymmetrically such that one person has information that another person lacks. In such situations, inter¬¬personal action coordination can be achieved if the know¬ledgeable person modulates basic parameters of her goal-directed actions in a way that provides relevant infor¬mation to the less knowledgeable partner. We investigated whether systematic violations of predicted movement duration provide a sufficient basis for such communication. Results of a joint movement task show that knowledgeable partners spontaneously and systematically violated the pre¬dictions of Fitts’ law in order to communicate if their partners could not see their movements. Unknowing partners had a benefit from these violations and more so if the violations provided a good signal-to-noise ratio. Together, our findings suggest that generating and perceiving systematic deviations from the predicted duration of a goal-directed action can enable non-conventionalized forms of communication during joint action.",>Cordula Vesper>Laura Schmitz>Günther Knoblich,">Department of Cognitive Science, Central European University>Department of Cognitive Science, Central European University>Department of Cognitive Science, Central European University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0385/index.html
2016,Perceived Momentum Influences Responsibility Judgments,"This work examines the extent to which people hold independent sequential events (e.g., players making correct/incorrect guesses) responsible for overall outcomes (e.g., the team winning/losing the game). Two types of events are found to garner the majority of responsibility for overall outcomes: (1) final events and (2) events that are perceived to disrupt momentum (e.g., an incorrect guess after a sequence of correct guesses). While previous research has shown that final events tend to be perceived as more responsible for overall outcomes, the current experiments are the first to document the role of perceived momentum on responsibility judgments. Specifically, we demonstrate that the effect is mediated by perceived momentum changes after the time of the event and moderated when exogenous factors (e.g., a delay between events) disrupt perceived momentum. We discuss how these findings relate to pivotality, the counterfactual simulation model, and the role of unexpectedness in responsibility judgments.",>Jeffrey Parker>Iman Paul>Nicholas Reinholtz,">Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA>Georgia Institute of Technology>University of Colorado Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0386/index.html
2016,A computational investigation of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: The case of spatial relations,"Investigations of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis often ask whether there is a difference in the non-linguistic behavior of speakers of two languages, generally without modeling the underlying process. Such an approach leaves underexplored the relative contributions of language and universal aspects of cognition, and how those contributions differ across languages. We explore the naming and non-linguistic pile-sorting of spatial scenes across speakers of five languages via a computational model grounded in an influential proposal: that language will affect cognition when non-linguistic information is uncertain. We report two findings. First, native language plays a small but significant role in predicting spatial similarity judgments across languages, consistent with earlier findings. Second, the size of the native-language role varies systematically, such that finer-grained semantic systems appear to shape similarity judgments more than coarser-grained systems do. These findings capture the tradeoff between language-specific and universal forces in cognition, and how that tradeoff varies across languages.",>Christine Tseng>Alexandra Carstensen>Terry Regier>Yang Xu,">California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, United States>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0387/index.html
2016,Effects of Auditory Input on a Spatial Serial Response Time Task,"The current study examined how relevant and irrelevant auditory stimuli affect the speed of responding to structured visual sequences. Participants were presented with a dot that appeared in different locations on a touch screen monitor and they were instructed to quickly touch the dot. Response times sped up over time, suggesting that participants learned the visual sequences. Response times in Experiment 1 were slower when the dot was paired with random sounds, suggesting that irrelevant sounds slowed down visual processing/responding. Dots in Experiment 2 were paired with correlated sounds (both auditory and visual information provided location information). While the redundant intersensory information did not speed up response times, it did partially attenuate auditory interference. These findings have implications on tasks that require processing of simultaneously presented auditory and visual information and provide evidence of auditory interference and possibly dominance on a task that typically favors the visual modality.",>Chris Robinson>Jessica Parker,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0388/index.html
2016,Memory for exemplars in category learning,"Some argue that category learning is mediated by two competing systems of learning: one explicit, one implicit (Ashby et al., 1998). These systems are hypothesised to be responsible for learning rule-based and information-integration category structures respectively. However, little experimental work has directly investigated whether people are conscious of category knowledge learned by the implicit system. In this study, we directly compared explicit recognition memory for exemplars between these two category structures. Contrary to the predictions of the dual-systems approach, we found preliminary evidence of superior exemplar memory after information-integration category learning compared to rule-based learning. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that participants learn information-integration category structures by using complex rules.",>Charlotte Edmunds>Andy Wills>Fraser Milton,>Plymouth Univeristy>Plymouth University>University of Exeter,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0389/index.html
2016,Chinese and English speakers’ neural representations of word meaning offer a different picture of cross-language semantics than corpus and behavioral measures,"Speakers of Chinese and English share decodable neural semantic representations, which can be elicited by words in each language. We explore various, common models of semantic representation and their correspondences to each other and to these neural representations. Despite very strong cross-language similarity in the neural data, we find that two versions of a corpus-based semantic model do not show the same strong correlation between languages. Behavior-based models better approximate cross-language similarity, but these models also fail to explain the similarities observed in the neural data. Although none of the examined models explain cross-language neural similarity, we explore how they might provide additional information over and above cross-language neural similarity. We find that native speakers’ ratings of noun-noun similarity and one of the corpus models do further correlate with neural data after accounting for cross-language similarities.",>Benjamin Zinszer>Andrew Anderson>Rajeev Raizada,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0390/index.html

Both effects, as well as a reasonable convergence with adult linguistic behavior, are shown by a Self-Organizing Map trained on naturalistic input. We investigate the effect of different ways of representing colors, i.e., as perceptual features or in terms of the cognitive biases on categorization extracted from crosslinguistic color naming data. We also consider the influence of color term frequency.

Level of abstraction in nominal referring expressions","Nominal reference is very flexible---the same object may be called a dalmatian, a dog, or an animal when all are literally true. What accounts for the choices that speakers make in how they refer to objects? The addition of modifiers (e.g. ""big dog"") has been extensively explored in the literature, but fewer studies have explored the choice of noun, including its level of abstraction. We collected freely produced referring expressions in a multi-player reference game experiment, where we manipulated the object's context. We find that utterance choice is affected by the contextual informativeness of a description, its length and frequency, and the typicality of the object for that description. Finally, we show how these factors naturally enter into a formal model of production within the Rational Speech-Acts framework, and that the resulting model predicts our quantitative production data.",>Caroline Graf>Judith Degen>Robert Hawkins>Noah Goodman,>University of Osnabrück>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0392/index.html
2016,Do classifier categories affect or reflect object concepts?,"We conceptualize objects based on sensorimotor information gleaned from real-world experience. To what extent is conceptual information structured according to higher-level linguistic features? We investigate whether classifiers, a grammatical category, shape the conceptual representations of objects. In three experiments native Mandarin speakers (a classifier language) and native Dutch speakers (a language without classifiers) judged the similarity of a target object with four objects (presented as words or pictures). One object shared a classifier with the target, the other objects did not. Overall, the target object was judged as more similar to the object with the shared classifier than distractor objects in both Dutch and Mandarin speakers, with no difference between the two languages. Thus, even speakers of a non-classifier language are sensitive to object similarities underlying classifier systems, and using a classifier system does not exaggerate these similarities. This suggests that classifier systems reflect, rather than affect, conceptual structure.",>Laura Speed>Jidong Chen>Falk Huettig>Asifa Majid,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands>California State University Fresno>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0393/index.html
2016,Exploring the Cost Function in Color Perception and Memory: An Information-Theoretic Model of Categorical Effects in Color Matching,"Recent evidence indicates that color categories can exert a strong influence over color matching in both perception and memory. We explore this phenomenon by analyzing the cost function for perceptual error. Our analysis is developed within the mathematical framework of rate–distortion theory. According to our approach, the goal of perception is to minimize the expected cost of error while subject to a constraint on the capacity of perceptual processing. We propose that the cost function in color perception is defined by the sum of two components: a metric cost associated with the magnitude of error in color space, and a cost associated with perceptual errors that cross color category boundaries. A computational model embodying this assumption is shown to produce an excellent fit to empirical data. The results generally suggest that what appear as 'errors' in working memory performance may reflect reasonable and systematic behaviors in the context of costs.",>Chris R. Sims>Zheng Ma>Sarah R.

2016,Abstraction in time: Finding hierarchical linguistic structure in a model of relational processing,"Abstract mental representation is fundamental for human cognition. Forming such representations in time, especially from dynamic and noisy perceptual input, is a challenge for any processing modality, but perhaps none so acutely as for language processing. We show that LISA (Hummel & Holyaok, 1997) and DORA (Doumas, Hummel, & Sandhofer, 2008), models built to process and to learn structured (i.e., symbolic) representations of conceptual properties and relations from unstructured inputs, show oscillatory activation during processing that is highly similar to the cortical activity elicited by the linguistic stimuli from Ding et al. (2016). We argue, as Ding et al. (2016), that this activation reflects formation of hierarchical linguistic representation, and furthermore, that the kind of computational mechanisms in LISA/DORA (e.g., temporal binding by systematic asynchrony of firing) may underlie formation of abstract linguistic representations in the human brain.",>Leonidas Doumas>Andrea Martin,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0395/index.html

When to stop evidence accumulation is an important question that such models do not currently answer. We present the first cognitive model that accurately predicts stopping decisions in individual economic decisions-from-experience trials, using an online learning model. Analysis of stopping decisions across three different datasets reveals three useful predictors of sampling duration - relative evidence strength, how long it takes participants to see all rewards, and a novel indicator of convergence of an underlying learning process, which we call predictive {\em volatility}. We quantify the relative strengths of these factors in predicting observers' stopping points, finding that predictive volatility consistently dominates relative evidence strength in stopping decisions.",>Nisheeth Srivastava>Johannes Mueller-Trede>Paul Schrater>Edward Vul,">UC San Diego, San Diego, CA, US>UC San Diego, San Diego, CA, US>University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, US>UC San Diego, San Diego, CA, US",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0396/index.html

We present a new way to fit language-based behavioral data that combines simple learning and processing mechanisms using optimization of language materials. We demonstrate that benchmark fits on multiple linguistic tasks can be achieved using this method and will argue that one must account not only for the internal parameters of a model but also the external experience that people receive when theorizing about human behavior.",>Brendan Johns>Michael Jones>Douglas Mewhort,">University at Buffalo>Indiana University, Bloomington>Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0397/index.html
2016,An Information-Processing Account of Representation Change: International Mathematical Olympiad Problems are Hard not only for Humans,"We present a new information-processing model of math problem solving in which representation change theory can be implemented. The problem representation process is divided into two. One is to translate a problem into a formula in a conservative extension of Zermelo-Fraenkel's set theory, and the other is to interpret the translated formulas in local mathematical theories. A ZF formula has several interpretations, and representation change is thus implementable as a choice of an interpretation. Adopting the theory of real closed fields as an example of local theory, we develop a prototype system. We use more than 400 problems from three sources as benchmarks: exercise books, university entrance examination, and the International Mathematical Olympiad problems. Our experimental results suggest that our model can serve as a basis of a quantitative study on representation change in the sense that the performance of our prototype system reflects difficulties of the problems quite precisely.",>Takuya Matsuzaki>Munehiro Kobayashi>Noriko H.

A change in the presentation timing of exemplars has also been shown to have an effect, reversing the prior observed pattern of basic-level generalization. We explore the precise mechanisms that could lead to such behavior by extending a computational model of word learning and generalization to integrate cognitive processes of memory and attention. Our results show that the interaction of forgetting and attention to novelty, as well as sensitivity to both type and token frequencies of exemplars, enables the model to replicate the empirical results from different presentation timings. Our results reinforce the need to incorporate general cognitive processes within word learning models to better understand observed behaviors in vocabulary acquisition.",>Erin Grant>Aida Nematzadeh>Suzanne Stevenson,>University of Toronto>University of Toronto>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0400/index.html
2016,Environmental Orientation Affects Emotional Expression Identification,"Spatial metaphors for affective valence are common in English, where up in space=happy/positive and down in space=sad/negative. Past research suggests that these metaphors have some measure of psychological reality: people are faster to respond to valenced stimuli when they are presented in metaphor-congruent regions of space. Here we explore whether the orientation of a stimulus –rather than its position– is sufficient to elicit such spatial-valence congruency effects, and, if so, which spatial reference frame(s) people use to represent this orientation. In Experiment 1, participants viewed images of happy and sad profile faces in different orientations and had to identify the depicted emotion. In Experiment 2, participants completed this task while lying down on their sides, thereby disassociating environmental and egocentric reference frames. Experiment 1 revealed a metaphor-congruent interaction between emotion and orientation, while Experiment 2 revealed that this spatial-valence congruency effect was only reliable in the environmental frame of reference.",>Stephen Flusberg>Derek Shapiro>Kevin Collister>Paul Thibodeau,">Purchase College, State University of New York>Purchase College, State University of New York>Purchase College, State University of New York>Oberlin College",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0401/index.html
2016,Testing the Tolerance Principle: Children form productive rules when it is more computationally efficient to do so,"During language acquisition, children must learn when to generalize a pattern – applying it broadly and to new words (‘add –ed’ in English) – and when to restrict generalization, storing the pattern only with specific lexical items. One effort to quantify the conditions for generalization, the Tolerance Principle, accurately predicts children’s generalizations in corpus-based studies. This principle hypothesizes that a general rule will be formed when it is computationally more efficient than storing lexical forms individually. Here we test the principle in an artificial language of 9 nonsense nouns. As predicted, children exposed to 5 regular forms and 4 exceptions generalized, applying the regular form to 100% of novel test words. Children exposed to 3 regular forms and 6 exceptions did not extend the rule, even though the token frequency of the regular form was still high. The Tolerance Principle thus captures a basic principle of generalization in rule formation.",>Kathryn D. Schuler>Charles Yang>Elissa L.

Participants studied either images of the same bird or varied birds from each of several categories. These images could be presented in a constant background color or different background colors. During test, birds were presented in only one of the studied background colors. Performance at test depended on the context overlap between study and test, with better performance when there was minimal context change during study. Also, contrary to previous findings, we found that learners generalized better when items were repeated during study and remembered old items better when items were varied during study. When there is a moderate degree of context change, there is no benefit of repetition or variation for either novel or old items. These results indicate that context change and item variation have complementary effects on learning.",>Dustin Finch>Paulo Carvalho>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0403/index.html
2016,Performance Pressure and Comparison in Relational Category Learning,"The study of relational categories has emphasized the importance of within-category comparison for learning and transfer – guided by predictions from structure mapping theory (Gentner, 1983). Recent research has yielded the predicted comparison advantage under the supervised observational learning mode (over sequential exposures) but, puzzlingly, not under the supervised classification mode. In the present study we evaluate performance pressure as a possible contributor to the ineffectuality of comparison under classification by crossing performance pressure (elevated and standard) with two classification learning formats (single-item and within-category pairs). We found: (1) that pressure hindered single-item learning, but not comparison learning; and (2) a novel comparison advantage under standard classification. We conclude: (1) that performance pressure exerts a deleterious effect on relational category learning that comparison may compensate for; and (2) that pressure does not seem to underlie lackluster classification + comparison performance (relative to observational learning).

Equally, changes in belief should depend only on the quality of the evidence, and not on factors such as the order in which the evidence is acquired, or whether intermediate judgements are requested during evidence acquisition. In contrast we show that requests for intermediate judgments can inhibit belief updating for real decision makers, which represents a new type of decision making fallacy. This behaviour is paradoxical from the point of view of classical Bayesian models, but we show that it is consistent with an a priori, parameter free prediction of a cognitive model based on quantum theory.",>James Yearsley>Emmanuel Pothos,">Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States>City University London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0405/index.html

The model's central assumption is that events are experienced through sequentially structured sensorimotor (SM) routines - as are the individuals that participate in them. In the light of this assumption, we propose that events and individuals are stored in semantic WM as *prepared SM routines*. This proposal allows a new mechanism for binding representations of individuals to semantic roles such as AGENT and PATIENT. It also enables a novel account of how expectations about forthcoming events can influence SM processing in real time as events are perceived.

2016,What do you expect from an unfamiliar talker?,"Speech perception is made much harder by variability between talkers. As a result, listeners need to adapt to each different talker's particular acoustic cue distributions. Thinking of this adaptation as a form of statistical inference, we explore the role that listeners' prior expectations play in adapting to an unfamiliar talker. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that listeners will have a harder time adapting to talkers whose cue distributions fall outside the range of normal variation across talkers. We also show that it is possible to infer listeners' shared prior expectations based on patterns of adaptation to different cue distributions. This provides a potentially powerful tool for directly probing listeners' prior expectations about talkers that does not rely on speech produced by many different talkers, which is costly to collect and annotate, and only indirectly related to listeners' subjective expectations.",>Dave Kleinschmidt>T.

2016,Working Memory Affects Attention to Loss Value and Loss Frequency in Decision-Making under Uncertainty,"Decision-making under uncertainty is pervasive. This work sought to understand the role of working memory (WM) in loss sensitivity by utilizing two widely used tasks, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Soochow Gambling Task (SGT), and manipulating WM with a dual-task paradigm. We hypothesized that WM load would reduce attention to both loss value and frequency in the decision-making tasks. To better delineate the psychological processes underpinning choice behavior, we developed an Expectancy-Frequency-Perseveration (EFP) model which parsimoniously captures three critical factors driving choices: expected value, frequency of gains and losses, and perseveration. Behavioral and computational modeling results indicate that WM load compromised performance in the IGT due to reduced attention to loss value but enhanced performance in the SGT because of diminished attention to loss frequency. Our findings suggest that WM heightens attention to losses, but that greater attention is given to loss frequency than loss value.",>Bo Pang>Kaileigh Byrne>Darrell Worthy,">Department of Psychology, Texas A&M; University>Department of Psychology, Texas A&M; University>Department of Psychology, Texas A&M; University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0408/index.html
2016,Adapting Deep Network Features to Capture Psychological Representations,"Deep neural networks have become increasingly successful at solving classic perception problems such as object recognition, semantic segmentation, and scene understanding, often reaching or surpassing human-level accuracy. This success is due in part to the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of high-dimensional inputs, a problem that humans must also solve. We examine the relationship between the representations learned by these networks and human psychological representations recovered from similarity judgments. We find that deep features learned in service of object classification account for a significant amount of the variance in human similarity judgments for a set of animal images. However, these features do not capture some qualitative distinctions that are a key part of human representations. To remedy this, we develop a method for adapting deep features to align with human similarity judgments, resulting in image representations that can potentially be used to extend the scope of psychological experiments.",>Joshua Peterson>Joshua Abbott>Thomas Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0409/index.html

Task instructions placed users either in a loss or gain framed context, such that those in the loss frame had to minimize expenses whereas those in the gain frame had to maximize profits. The virtual agent displayed facial emotions so that we could also test how interpersonal emotions interact with framing. Results suggest that individuals are more motivated to minimize their losses than maximizing their gains. The loss frame caused individuals to demand more during the negotiation, hence to minimize expenses. Neurophysiological results suggest that cardiovascular patterns of challenge (i.e., positive motivations) were present in the loss frame condition, most strongly when the virtual human smiled. We discuss these results in regards to Prospect Theory.

2016,Generalization of within-category feature correlations,"Theoretical and empirical work in the field of classification learning is centered on a ‘reference point’ view, where learners are thought to represent categories in terms of stored points in psychological space (e.g., prototypes, exemplars, clusters). Reference point representations fully specify how regions of psychological space are associated with class labels, but they do not contain information about how features relate to one another (within- class or otherwise). We present a novel experiment suggesting human learners acquire knowledge of within-class feature correlations and use this knowledge during generalization. Our methods conform strictly to the traditional artificial classification learning paradigm, and our results cannot be explained by any prominent reference point model (i.e., GCM, ALCOVE). An alternative to the reference point framework (DIVA) provides a strong account of the observed performance.

2016,"Deconstructing ""tomorrow"": How children learn the semantics of time","Deictic time words (e.g., “tomorrow"") refer to time periods relative to the present. While children produce these words by age 2-3, they use them incorrectly for several more years. Here, as a case study in abstract word learning, we explored what children know about these words during this delay. Specifically, we probed children’s knowledge of three aspects of meaning: deictic (past/future) status, sequential ordering (e.g., “tomorrow” is after “yesterday”), and remoteness from now. We asked 3- to 8-year-olds to place these words on a timeline extending from the past (left) to the future (right). Even 4-year-olds could meaningfully represent the words’ deictic status and order, and by 6, the majority displayed adult-like performance. Adult-like knowledge of remoteness, however, emerged independently, after age 7. Thus, even while children use these terms incorrectly, they are gradually constructing a structured semantic domain, including information about the deictic, sequential, and metric relations among terms.",>Katharine Tillman>Tyler Marghetis>David Barner>Mahesh Srinivasan,">University of California, San Diego>Indiana University, Bloomington>University of California, San Diego>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0412/index.html

This gaze behaviour, known as looking at nothing, is assumed to be driven by the use of spatial indices associated with external information. We investigated whether people form spatial indices and look at nothing when retrieving words from memory. Participants were simultaneously presented four words. During retrieval participants looked at the relevant, blank location, where the probe word had appeared previously, longer than the other blank locations. Additionally, word presentation was sometimes followed by a visual cue either co-located or not with the probe word. Valid cues functioned as visual reinforcement while invalid cues caused interference. Finally, participants with better visuospatial memory looked less at the relevant, blank location, suggesting a dynamic relationship between so-called “external” and “internal” memory. Overall findings suggest an automatic, instantaneous spatial indexing mechanism for words and a dynamic looking at nothing behaviour.",>Alper Kumcu>Robin L.

2016,Bayesian Pronoun Interpretation in Mandarin Chinese,Kehler and Rohde (2013) proposed a Bayesian theory of pronoun interpretation where the influence of world knowledge emerges as effects on the prior and the influence of information structure as effects on the likelihood: P(referent|pronoun) ∝ P(pronoun|referent)P(referent). Here we present two experiments on Mandarin Chinese that allow us to test the generality of the theory for a language with different syntactic-semantic associations than English. Manipulations involving two different classes of implicit-causality verbs and passive vs. active voice confirmed key predictions of the Bayesian theory: effects of these manipulations on the prior and likelihood in production were consistently reflected in pronoun interpretation preferences.

2016,Leveling the Field: Talking Levels in Cognitive Science,"Talk of levels is everywhere in cognitive science. Whether it is in terms of adjudicating longstanding debates or motivating foundational concepts, one cannot go far without hearing about the need to talk at different ‘levels’. Yet in spite of its widespread application and use, the concept of levels has received little sustained attention within cognitive science. This paper provides an analysis of the various ways the notion of levels has been deployed within cognitive science. The paper begins by introducing and motivating discussion via four representative accounts of levels. It then turns to outlining and relating the four accounts using two dimensions of comparison. The result is the creation of a conceptual framework that maps the logical space of levels talk, which offers an important step toward making sense of levels talk within cognitive science",>Luke Kersten>Robert West>Andrew Brook,">Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada>Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada>Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0415/index.html
2016,Know Your Enemy: Applying Cognitive Modeling in Security Domain,"Game Theory -based decision aids have been successfully employed in real-world policing, anti-terrorism, and wildlife conservation efforts (Tambe, Jiang, An, & Jain, 2013). Cognitive modeling, in concert with model tracing and dynamic parameter fitting techniques, may be used to improve the performance of such decision aids by predicting individual attacker behavior in repeated security games. We present three simulations, showing that (1) cognitive modeling can aid in greatly improving decision-aid performance in the security domain; and (2) despite the fact that individual attackers will differ in initial preferences and in how they learn, model parameters can be adjusted dynamically to make useful predictions for each attacker.",>Vladislav Daniel Veksler>Norbou Buchler,>U.S. Army Research Laboratory>U.S. Army Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0416/index.html
2016,Probability Prediction in Children with ASD,"Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often struggle with making inductive generalizations. Yet for typically developing children, the capacity to make such generalizations is a hallmark of human learning. This ability requires some understanding of “intuitive statistics” (i.e., the understanding that there is a relationship between samples and populations), which have been previously demonstrated to emerge early on in infancy. We hypothesized that the challenges with inductive generalization among the ASD population may have its roots in weaknesses in probabilistic reasoning. In the current study, we gave children with ASD a probability prediction task adapted from the method used with infants in Teglas et al. (2007), and our results over two experiments with two groups (one from the U.S. and one from Singapore) suggest that compared with typically developing children, children with autism may have difficulties in engaging in probabilistic reasoning.",>Zi L.

2016,Left-right mental timeline is robust to visuospatial and verbal interference,"We test the robustness of American college students’ mental timeline to dual tasks that have interfered with spatial and verbal reasoning in prior work. We focus on the left-right axis for representing sequences of events. We test American college students, who read from left to right. We test for automatic space-time mappings using two established space-time association tasks. We find that their tendency to associate earlier events with the left side of space and later events with the right remains under conditions of visuospatial and verbal interference. We find this both when participants made time judgments about linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli. We discuss the relationship between these results and those obtained for mental timelines that result from learning new metaphors in language (Hendricks & Boroditsky, 2015), and the effects of the same interference tasks on number tasks (mental number-line and counting; van Dijck et al., 2009; Frank et al., 2012).",>Rose Hendricks>Esther Walker>Benjamin Bergen>Lera Boroditsky>Rafael Nunez,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0418/index.html
2016,A speed-accuracy trade-off in children's processing of scalar implicatures,"Scalar implicatures - inferences from a weak description (""I ate some of the cookies"") that a stronger alternative is true (""I didn't eat all"") - are paradigm cases of pragmatic inference. Children's trouble with scalar implicatures is thus an important puzzle for theories of pragmatic development, given their communicative competence in other domains. Previous research has suggested that access to alternatives might be key. Here, we explore children's reaction times in a new paradigm for measuring scalar implicature processing. Alongside failures on scalar implicatures with ""some,"" we replicate previous reports of failures with ""none,"" and find evidence of a speed-accuracy trade-off for both quantifiers. Motivated by these findings, we explore the relationship between accuracy and reaction time with a Drift Diffusion Model. We find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that preschoolers lack access to alternatives for scalar implicature computation, although this set of alternatives may be broader than previously assumed.",>Rose Schneider>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0419/index.html

Theories differ in whether they endorse geometric or functional properties and how these properties are related to meaning and use. We directly examine the roles of geometric and functional information in adults’ and children’s use of in and on by developing a large sample of relations situated within a small gradable geometric and functional feature space. We propose that variation in features across items is systematically related to the use of in and on and demonstrate that feature-language relationships change across development: adults’ expression use is sensitive to both geometric and functional features, while children’s use varies only according to geometric features.",>Kristen Johannes>Colin Wilson>Barbara Landau,>WestEd>Johns Hopkins University>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0420/index.html

2016,The mismeasurement of mind: How neuropsychological testing creates a false picture of cognitive aging,"Age-related declines in scores on neuropsychological tests are widely believed to reveal that human cognitive capacities decline across the lifespan. In a computational simulation, we show how the behavioral patterns observed in Paired Associate Learning (PAL), a particularly sensitive measures of age-related performance change (Rabbitt & Lowe, 2000), are predicted by the models used to formalize associative learning processes in other areas of behavioral and neuroscientific research. The simulation further predicts that manipulating language exposure will reproduce the experience-related performance differences erroneously attributed to age-related decline in age-matched adults. Consistent with this, older bilinguals outperformed native speakers in a German PAL test, an advantage that increased with age. These analyses and results show that age-related PAL performance changes reflect the predictable effects of learning on the associability of test items, and indicate that failing to control for these effects is distorting our understanding of cognitive and brain development in adulthood.",>Michael Ramscar>Ching Chu Sun>Peter Hendrix>Harald Baayen,>Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen>Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen>Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen>Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0422/index.html

Arguably, the most successful models of causal reasoning, Causal Graphical Models (CGMs), perform well in some situations, but there is considerable variation in how well they are able to account for data, both across scenarios and between individuals. We propose a model of causal reasoning based on quantum probability (QP) theory that accounts for behavior in situations where CGMs fail. Whether QP or classical models are appropriate depends on the representation of events constructed by the reasoner. We describe an experiment that suggests the representation of events can change with experience to become more classical, and that the representation constructed can vary between individuals, in a way that correlates with a simple measure of cognitive ability, The Cognitive Reflection Task.",>James Yearsley>Jennifer Trueblood>Emmanuel Pothos,">Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA>City University London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0423/index.html

We describe a model of probability estimation where people do follow probability theory in estimation, but are subject to random error or noise. This model predicts that people's conditional probability estimates will agree closely with probability theory for certain noise-cancelling expressions, but deviate from probability theory for other expressions. We describe an experiment which strongly confirms these predictions, suggesting that people estimate conditional probabilities in a way that follows standard probability theory, but is subject to the biasing effects of random noise.",>Fintan Costello>Paul Watts,>University College Dublin>National University of Ireland Maynooth,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0424/index.html
2016,When does passive learning improve the effectiveness of active learning?,"Much of what we learn comes from a mix of information that we select (active) and information that we receive (passive). But which type of training is better for different kinds of learning problems? Here, we explore this question by comparing different sequences of active/passive training in an abstract concept learning task. First, we replicate the active learning advantage from Markant & Gureckis (2014) (Experiments 1a and 1b). Then, we provide a test of whether experiencing active learning first or passive learning first improves the effectiveness of concept learning (Experiment 2). Across both experiments, active training led to better learning of the target concept, but ""passive-first"" learners were more accurate than ""active-first"" learners and more efficient than ""active-only"" learners. These findings broaden our understanding of when different sequences of active/passive learning are more effective, suggesting that for certain problems active exploration can be enhanced with prior passive experience.",>Kyle MacDonald>Mike Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, U.S.>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0425/index.html

In this paper, we propose an integrated theoretical account and associated computational model that aims to quantify how people balance structural and temporal constraints in everyday multitasking. We validate the theory using data from an empirical study in which drivers performed a visual-search task while navigating a driving environment. Through examination of illustrative protocols from the model and human drivers as well as the overall fit on the aggregate glance data, we explore the implications of the theory and model for time-critical multitasking domains.",>Dario Salvucci>Tuomo Kujala,>Drexel University>University of Jyväskylä,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0426/index.html
2016,Do additional features help or harm during category learning? An exploration of the curse of dimensionality in human learners,"How does the number of features impact category learning? One view suggests additional features create a “curse of dimensionality” - where having more features causes the size of the search space to explode such that learning becomes increasingly challenging. The opposing view suggests additional features provides additional information which should be beneficial. Previous research exploring this issue has produced conflicting results: some finding additional features are helpful (Hoffman & Murphy, 2006) or harmful (Minda & Smith, 2001; Edgell et al., 1996). Here we investigate the possibility that category structure may explain this apparent discrepancy – more features are useful in categories with family resemblance structure, but are not in rule-based categories. We find while the impact of having many features depends on category structure, which can be explained by a single unified model that attends to a single feature on any given trial and uses that information to make judgments.",>Wai Keen Vong>Andrew Hendrickson>Amy Perfors>Daniel Navarro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0427/index.html

We hypothesized an intrinsic link between the ability to update beliefs in light of evidence and the ability to ask informative questions. Four- to ten-year-old children played an iPad game asking them to identify a hidden bug. Learners could either ask about individual bugs, or make a series of feature queries (e.g., ""Does the bug have antennae?"") that could more efficiently narrow the hypothesis space. The task display either helped children integrate evidence with the hypothesis space or required them to do so. Although we found that helping children update their beliefs improved some aspects of their active inquiry behavior, those that updated their own beliefs asked questions that were more context-sensitive and thus informative. The results show how making a task more difficult may actually improve children’s active inquiry skills, thus illustrating a type of desirable difficulty.",>George Kachergis>Marjorie Rhodes>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0428/index.html

2016,Statistical Learning of Prosodic Patterns and Reversal of Perceptual Cues for Sentence Prominence,"Recent work has proposed that prominence perception in speech could be driven by predictability of prosodic patterns, connecting prominence perception to the concept of statistical learning. In the present study, we tested the predictability hypothesis by conducting a listening test where subjects were first exposed to a 5-minute stream of sentences with a certain proportion of sentence-final words having either a falling or rising pitch trajectory. After the exposure stage, subjects were asked to grade prominence in a set of novel sentences with similar pitch patterns. The results show that the subjects were significantly more likely to perceive words with low-probability pitch trajectories as prominent independently of the direction of the pitch change. This suggests that even short exposure to prosodic patterns with a certain statistical structure can induce changes in prominence perception, supporting the connection between prominence perception and attentional orientation towards low-probability events in an otherwise predictable context.",>Sofoklis Kakouros>Okko Räsänen,>Aalto University>Aalto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0430/index.html

We can also determine if two very different views of a stranger are indeed of the same person. How can we recognize familiar objects quickly, while performing deliberate, perceptual inference on unfamiliar objects? We describe a model combining an identity classification network for familiar faces with an analysis by synthesis approach for unfamiliar faces to make rich inferences about any observed face. We additionally develop an online non-parametric clustering algorithm for recognition of repeatedly experienced unfamiliar faces, and show how new faces can become familiar by being consolidated into the identity recognition network. Finally, we show that this model predicts human behavior in viewpoint generalization and identity clustering tasks, and predicts processing time differences between familiar and unfamiliar faces.",>Kelsey Allen>Ilker Yildirim>Josh Tenenbaum,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, US>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>MIT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0431/index.html
2016,On the Link between Fact Learning and General Cognitive Ability,"Adaptive fact learning systems have been developed to make optimal use of testing and spacing effects by taking into account individual differences in learning efficiency. Measures derived from these systems, capturing the individual differences, predict later performance in similar and different fact learning tasks. Additionally, there is a rich body of literature showing that individual differences in general cognitive ability or working memory capacity can predict scores on achievement tests. If these measures also influence fact learning, incorporating them might further enhance adaptive systems. However, here we provide evidence that performance during fact learning is neither related to working memory capacity nor general cognitive ability. This means that the individual differences captured by our adaptive learning system encapsulate characteristics of learners that are independent of their general cognitive ability. Consequently, adaptive learning methods should focus primarily on memory-related processes.",>Florian Sense>Rob R.

2016,The paradox of relational development: Could language learning be (temporarily) harmful?,"Recent studies report a striking decline in children’s ability to notice same-different relations around age 3 (Walker et al., 2015). We propose that such a decline results from an object focus related to children’s avid noun-learning. To test this, we examine children’s performance on a classic relational task – the relational match-to-sample task (RMTS). Prior work has shown that 4-year-olds can pass this task (Christie & Gentner, 2014). However, if nominal language induces an object focus, their performance should be disrupted by a noun-labeling pretask. In two experiments, 4-year-olds either labeled objects or actions in a naming pretask. Then they completed the RMTS task. Consistent with the noun-focus explanation, the object-naming group failed the RMTS task, whereas the action-naming group and a control group both succeeded. This suggests that nominal language can lead to an object focus, and that this could explain the temporary decline in children’s relational processing.",>Christian Hoyos>Ruxue Shao>Dedre Gentner,">Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, USA>Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States>Northwestern University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0433/index.html

We tested whether implicit learning of adjacent and non-adjacent sequences occurs in a non-linguistic, finger sequence task (Serial Reaction Time task), and if so, whether these implicitly-learned dependencies can cause syntactic priming in the linguistic domain. We followed the logic that exposure to statistical patterns in the SRT task may influence language users’ relative clause (RC) attachment biases, and trained participants on SRT sequences with adjacent or non-adjacent dependencies. Participants then wrote completions to relative clause fragments in a situation where they could opt for adjacent or non-adjacent linguistic structures. Participants successfully learned the adjacent and non-adjacent dependency implicitly during the SRT task, but, strikingly, their RC continuations did not exhibit priming effects. Implications for theories of syntactic priming and its relations to implicit learning are discussed.",>Hao Wang>Elsi Kaiser,">University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States>University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0434/index.html

A recent study using fMRI adaptation (Glezer, et al., 2009) provided evidence that neurons in the VWFA are selectively tuned to real words, but not pseudowords, suggesting the VWFA is tuned to real words and not sublexical structure. Here, we develop a realistic model of the VWFA by training a deep convolutional neural network to map printed words to their labels. The network is able to achieve an accuracy of 98.5% on the test set.

2016,Think Fast! Mental-state Language is Related to the Speed of False-belief Reasoning in Adulthood,"When tested appropriately, infants appear to demonstrate false-belief understanding in the first year of life. Some have argued that this is inconsistent with the well-established relationship between social experience and preschoolers’ false-belief performance. We argue that these two sets of findings are not inconsistent because the ability to attribute false beliefs to others is necessary but not sufficient for false-belief performance, and we propose several ways that one social factor, hearing and using mental-state language, might relate to false-belief performance throughout the lifespan. We tested this account by examining the relationship between adults’ use of mental-state language and their false-belief understanding. Participants’ use of mental-state language was related to how quickly they could accurately predict the behavior of agents on the basis of desires and beliefs. These findings provide the first evidence that mental-state talk and false-belief performance are related into adulthood.",>Erin Roby>Rose Scott,">University of California Merced, Merced, California, United States>University of California Merced, Merced, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0436/index.html

As a first proof of concept, we demonstrate how a heuristic decision strategy such as Take The Best (TTB) can emerge from smaller, probabilistically updated building blocks. Based on a self-reinforcing sampling scheme, different building blocks are combined and, over time, tree-like non-compensatory heuristics emerge. This new algorithm, coined Approximately Bayesian Computed Take The Best (ABC-TTB), is able to recover a data set that was generated by TTB, leads to sensible inferences about cue importance and cue directions, can outperform traditional TTB, and allows to trade-off performance and computational effort explicitly.

We often make these categorizations from visual input, but even when our attention is otherwise occupied, do we automatically analyze the world in terms of event structure? In two experiments, participants made speeded gender judgments for a continuous sequence of male-female interaction scenes. Even though gender was orthogonal to event roles (whether the Agent was male or Female, or vice-versa), a switching cost was observed when the target character’s role reversed from trial to trial, regardless of whether the actors, events, or side of the target character differed. Crucially, this effect held even when nothing in the task required attention to the relationship between actors.

Recent studies comparing CNNs with neural data from cortical area IT suggest that CNNs may—in addition to providing good engineering solutions—provide good models of biological visual systems. Here, we report evidence that CNNs are, in fact, not good models of human visual perception. We show that a 3D shape inference model explains human performance on an object shape similarity task better than CNNs.

Such errors are often attributed to memory deficits, such as loss of activation or interference with other tasks (Altmann & Trafton, 2002). We are arguing that this view neglects the role of the environment. As embodied beings, humans make extensive use of external cues during the planning and execution of tasks. In this paper, we study how the visual interaction with a computer interface is linked to user errors.

Further, the model is able to produce novel encodings (active vs. passive) for a particular semantics, as well as generate such encodings for previously unseen situations, thus demonstrating both syntactic and semantic systematicity.

However, most experiments in which non-adjacent dependencies are learned bracketed the dependent material with pauses, which is not how dependencies appear in natural language. Here we report successful learning of embedded NAD without pause bracketing. Instead, we induce learners to compute structure in an artificial language by entraining them through processing English sentences. We also found that learning becomes difficult when grammatical entrainment causes learners to compute boundaries that are misaligned with NAD structures. In sum, we demonstrated that grammatical entrainment can induce boundaries that can carry over to reveal structures in novel language materials, and this effect can be used to induce learning of non-adjacent dependencies.",>Hao Wang>Jason Zevin>Toben Mintz,">University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States>University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States>University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0442/index.html

All these activities proceed under the plausible assumption that not all information can be or ought to be processed for a system to satisfice in an ever changing world. In this paper, we describe an attention-centric cognitive system called ARCADIA that demonstrates the orienting, filtering, and resource-skewing functions mentioned above.

2016,Syntactic Flexibility in the Noun: Evidence from Picture Naming,"Does syntactic information affect the production of bare nouns? Research into this issue has explored word-specific features (e.g., gender). However, word-independent syntactic distributions may also play a role. For example, studies of word recognition have uncovered strong effects of the diversity of a word's syntactic distribution – its syntactic flexibility – on response times in visual lexical decision. By contrast, studies of sentence production have produced strong but conflicted effects of syntactic flexibility. We propose that syntactic flexibility also affects production of individual words. We reanalyze a database of previously collected timed picture naming data using two novel measures of syntactic flexibility, one based on the relations stemming from the noun, and one based on the relations extending to the noun. Our results show that nouns that project a diverse array of structures are produced faster, and those that are integrated into a diverse array of structures are produced slower.",>Nicholas Lester>Fermin Moscoso del Prado Martin,">University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, USA>University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0446/index.html
2016,Alien species and alienable traits: An artificial language game investigating the spread of cultural variants between antagonistic groups,"The spread of cultural variants, such as dress or speech patterns, may be promoted or inhibited by different types of bias. In model-based bias, variants are differentially adopted according to characteristics of individuals exhibiting them. Based on a hypothesis from sociolinguistic fieldwork, we posit two types of model-based bias: bias associated with alienable traits such as “tough” and inalienable traits such as “male.” We tested this by conducting a laboratory experiment in which participants played a computer game using an artificial language with two different dialects. Players were significantly more likely to borrow features of the other dialect when the variation was explicitly associated with toughness than when it was associated with another alien race. This suggests that cultural variants linked to alienable traits are more likely to be adopted than those linked to inalienable ones, even if the practical implications of the two traits are very similar.",>Betsy Sneller>Gareth Roberts,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0447/index.html
2016,Inferring priors in compositional cognitive models,"We apply Bayesian data analysis to a structured cognitive model in order to determine the priors that support human generalizations in a simple concept learning task. We modeled 250,000 ratings in a ""number game"" experiment where subjects took examples of a numbers produced by a program (e.g. 4, 16, 32) and rated how likely other numbers (e.g. 8 vs. 9) would be to be generated. This paper develops a data analysis technique for a family of compositional ""Language of Thought"" (LOT) models which permits discovery of subjects' prior probability of mental operations (e.g. addition, multiplication, etc.) in this domain. Our results reveal high correlations between model mean predictions and subject generalizations, but with some qualitative mismatch for a strongly compositional prior.",>Eric Bigelow>Steven Piantadosi,">University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States>University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0448/index.html
2016,Which is in front of Chinese people: Past or Future? A study on Chinese people’s space-time mapping,"Research shows that Chinese, when they gesture about time, tend to put the past “ahead” and future “behind”. Do they think of time in the way as suggested by their gestures? In Exp1 we show that when time conceptions are constructed with neutral wording, Chinese are more likely to have past-in-front-mappings than Spaniards. This could be due to cultural differences in temporal focus of attention, as Chinese people are more past-oriented than Europeans. However, Exp2&3 show that, independent of culture, Chinese’s past-in-front mapping is sensitive to the wording of sagittal spatial metaphors. In comparison to neutral wording, they have more past-in-front mappings when time conceptions are constructed with past-in-front spatial metaphors, whereas fewer past-in-front mappings are constructed with future-in-front metaphors. There thus appear to be both long-term effects of cultural attitudes on the spatialization of time, and also immediate effects of the space-time metaphors used to probe people’s mental representations.",>Yan Gu>Yeqiu Zheng>Marc Swerts,">Tilburg center for Cognition and Communication, Tilburg University>Department of Econometrics and Operations Research, Tilburg University>Tilburg center for Cognition and Communication, Tilburg University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0449/index.html
2016,A performance model for early word learning,"The emergence of language around a child’s first birthday is one of the greatest transformations in human development. Does this transition require a fundamental shift in the child’s knowledge or beliefs, or could it instead be attributable to more gradual changes in processing abilities? We present a simple model of cognitive performance that supports the second conclusion. The premise is that any cognitive operation requires multiple steps, each of which require some time to complete and have some probability of failure. We use meta-analysis to estimate these parameters for two components of simple ostensive word learning: social cue use and word recognition. When combined in our model, these estimates suggest that learning should be very difficult for children younger than around a year, especially with gaze alone. This model takes a first step towards quantifying performance limitations for cognitive development and may be broadly applicable to other developmental changes.",>Michael Frank>Molly Lewis>Kyle MacDonald,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0450/index.html
2016,Cognitive biases and social coordination in the emergence of temporal language,"Humans spatialize time. This occurs within individual minds and also in larger, shared cultural systems like language. Understanding the origins of space-time mappings requires analyses at multiple levels, from initial individual biases to cultural evolution. Here we present a laboratory experiment that simulates the cultural emergence of space-time mappings. Dyads had to communicate about temporal concepts using only a novel, spatial signaling device. Over the course of their interactions, participants rapidly established semiotic systems that mapped systematically between time and space. These semiotic systems exhibited a number of similarities, but also striking idiosyncrasies. By foregrounding the interaction of mechanisms that operate on disparate timescales, laboratory experiments can shed light on the commonalities and variety found in space-time mappings in languages around the world.",>Tessa Verhoef>Esther Walker>Tyler Marghetis,">University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California, United States>University of California, San Diego>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0451/index.html

We focus on the following question: To what extent does training on one task improve the performance on another task? The tasks are Piaget’s (1959) Balance Scale Task and Number Conservation Task, and a task that we will call the Une-Sentence Task, which is taken from Karmiloff-Smith's (1979) experiment on the acquisition of determiners in French. We re-implemented already existing models within the framework of the PRIMs cognitive architecture (Taatgen, 2013). Each task was subdivided in certain stages related to the complexity of the problem-solving strategies. We show that mastery of a certain stage of a problem becomes easier if a higher stage of another task is mastered first.",>Sarah Rupp>Niels Taatgen,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0452/index.html

Ninety-five university students were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: Description, Sampling (where the participants were allowed to sample through the outcomes presented as a pack of cards) and Interactive (where the participants were invited to spread out all possible outcomes in a sample) and made three gain-framed choices and three loss-framed choices, with two filler tasks after the first three choices. The results revealed a significant interaction effect between framing and choice condition. In the Description choice condition, participants were more risk-seeking with loss-framed problems. This pattern was reversed in the Sampling choice condition where participants were more risk-seeking with gain frames. Finally, the Interactive choice condition resulted in a classic pattern of framing effect, whereby people were more risk averse in the domain of gains.",>Gaëlle Vallée-Tourangeau>Frédéric Vallée-Tourangeau>Madhuri Ramasubramanian,">Department of Management, Kingston University London, United Kingdom>Department of Psychology, Kingston University London, United Kingdom>Department of Psychology, University of Madras, India",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0453/index.html

Top-down influences on event apprehension,"Not much is known about event apprehension, the earliest stage of information processing in elicited language production studies, using pictorial stimuli. A reason for our lack of knowledge on this process is that apprehension happens very rapidly (<350 ms after stimulus onset, Griffin & Bock 2000), making it difficult to measure the process directly. To broaden our understanding of apprehension, we analyzed landing positions and onset latencies of first fixations on visual stimuli (pictures of real-world events) given short stimulus presentation times, presupposing that the first fixation directly results from information processing during apprehension.",>Johannes Gerwien>Monique Flecken,">University of Heidelberg, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0454/index.html
2016,Definitely maybe and possibly even probably: efficient communication of higher-order uncertainty,"Possibility and probability expressions, like possibly or probably, are frequently assumed to communicate that the probability of a proposition is above a certain threshold. Most previous empirical research on these expressions has focused on cases of known objective chance: if the true objective probability is given, would a speaker use possibly, probably or one of their kin? Here, we investigate the use of probability expressions when speakers have subjective uncertainty about objective chance, i.e., higher-order uncertainty. Experimental data suggest that speakers’ choices of a probability expression is a complex function of their state of higher-order uncertainty. We formulate a computational probabilistic model of pragmatic speaker behavior that explains the experimental data.",>Michele Herbstritt>Michael Franke,">Universitaet Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany>Universitaet Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0455/index.html
2016,Dynamical systems modeling of the child--mother dyad: Causality between child-directed language complexity and language development,"We model the causal links between child language (CL) and child-directed language (CDL). We take pairs of sequences of linguistic measurements from a longitudinal study. Each child-mother pair of sequences is considered as an instance of the trajectory of a high-dimensional dynamical system. We then use Multispatial Convergent Cross Mapping to ascertain the directions of causality between the pairs of sequences, that is, whether the complexity of CL drives that of CDL, the complexity of CDL drives that of CL, both, or neither. We find that children are responsive to the amount of speech and the diversity of words produced by their mothers, but not vice-versa. However, the syntactic diversities of the children's utterances drive the syntactic diversity of the mothers' utterances. This is evidence for fine-grained fine-tuning of CDL in response only to the syntax of CL.",>Jeremy Irvin>Daniel Spokoyny>Fermin Moscoso del Prado Martin,">University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0456/index.html
2016,The Relational SNARC: Spatial Representation of Nonsymbolic Ratios?,Recent research has highlighted the operation of a ratio processing system that represents the analog magnitudes of nonsymbolic ratios. This study investigated whether such representations would demonstrate spatial associations parallel to the SNARC (spatial numeric association of response codes) effect previously demonstrated with whole number magnitudes. Participants judged whether nonsymbolic ratio test stimuli were larger or smaller than reference stimuli using response keys located alternately either on the left or on the right side of space. Larger ratio magnitudes were associated with the right side of space and smaller magnitudes with the left. These results demonstrate that nonsymbolic ratio magnitudes – defined relationally by pairs of components – are characterized by a left-to-right spatial mapping. The current focus on ratio magnitudes expands our understanding of the basic human perceptual apparatus and how it might provide tools that grant intuitive access to more advanced numerical concepts beyond whole numbers.,>Percival Matthews>Rui Meng>Elizabeth Toomarian>Edward Hubbard,">University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0457/index.html
2016,Emotional influences on time perception,"In studies on prospective time perception, a prolonging effect of arousal on time estimates is commonly reported for durations under 2s while the effect vanishes for longer intervals. In this study, we investigated how arousal and pleasure induced by aural stimuli varying in volume and valence influenced reproductions in the range from 1.1s to 5s. As expected, higher arousal was associated with higher estimates for 1.1s durations. However, this effect was also found for 3.8s durations. An additional analysis with linear mixed models revealed an interaction between volume manipulation and subjective ratings regarding arousal and pleasure. Based on these results we propose that subjective experience of the emotional quality of stimuli might be interesting for further research on prospective time perception. Moreover, the results showed that not only within subject variation should be statistically controlled when analyzing such data. Instead, statistical models should also include parameters controlling for stimulus material.",>Anna K.

A hierarchical approach to estimating subjective beliefs from empirical data,"People's beliefs about everyday events are both of theoretical interest in their own right and an important ingredient in model building---especially in Bayesian cognitive models of phenomena such as logical reasoning, future predictions, and language use. Here, we explore several recently used methods for measuring subjective beliefs about unidimensional contiguous properties, such as the likely price of a new watch. As a first step towards a way of assessing and comparing belief elicitation methods, we use hierarchical Bayesian modeling for inferring likely population-level beliefs as the central tendency of participants' individual-level beliefs. Three different dependent measures are considered: (i) slider ratings of (relative) likelihood of intervals of values, (ii) a give-a-number task, and (iii) choice of the more likely of two intervals of values. Our results suggest that using averaged normalized slider ratings for binned quantities is a practical and fairly good approximator of inferred population-level beliefs.",>Michael Franke>Fabian Dablander>Anthea Schoeller>Erin Bennett>Judith Degen>Michael Tessler>Justine Kao>Noah Goodman,">Department of Linguistics, University of Tübingen>Department of Linguistics, University of Tübingen>Department of Linguistics, University of Tübingen>Department of Psychology, Stanford University>Department of Psychology, Stanford University>Department of Psychology, Stanford University>Department of Psychology, Stanford University>Department of Psychology, Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0460/index.html

Children were presented with a simple memory game on an iPad. During the study phase, for half of the materials children could decide the order and pacing of stimuli presentation (active condition). For the other half of the materials, children observed the study choices of another child (yoked condition). We found that recognition performance was better for the objects studied in the active condition as compared to the yoked condition. Furthermore, we found that the memory advantages of active learning persisted over a one-week delay between study and test.

In Study 1, college students (n = 21) were instructed to either paraphrase or self-explain science texts. Paraphrasing was characterized by greater cohesion in terms of lexical overlap whereas self-explanation included greater lexical diversity and more connectives to specify relations between ideas. In Study 2, adolescent students (n = 84) were provided with instruction and practice in self-explanation and reading strategies across 8 sessions. Self-explanations increased in lexical diversity but became more causally and semantically cohesive over time.

2016,Specificity at the basic level in event taxonomies: The case of Maniq verbs of ingestion,"Previous research on basic-level object categories shows there is cross-cultural variation in basic-level concepts, arguing against the idea that the basic level reflects an objective reality. In this paper, I extend the investigation to the domain of events. More specifically, I present a case study of verbs of ingestion in Maniq illustrating a highly specific categorization of ingestion events at the basic level. A detailed analysis of these verbs reveals they tap into culturally salient notions. Yet, cultural salience alone cannot explain specificity of basic-level verbs, since ingestion is a domain of universal human experience. Further analysis reveals, however, that another key factor is the language itself. Maniq’s preference for encoding specific meaning in basic-level verbs is not a peculiarity of one domain, but a recurrent characteristic of its verb lexicon, pointing to the significant role of the language system in the structure of event concepts.",>Ewelina Wnuk,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands

This paper presents the switch task to further explore the contingencies between learning goals, learning modes, outcomes, and category representations. Given that the ability to switch items between categories nicely encapsulates category knowledge, how does this relate to more familiar tasks like inferring features and classifying exemplars? To address this question we present an empirical investigation of this new task, side-by-side with the well-established alternative of classification learning. The results show that the category knowledge acquired through switch learning shares similarities with inference learning and provides insight into the processes at work. The implications of this research, particularly the distinctions between this learning mode and well-known alternatives, are discussed.",>Garrett Honke>Nolan Conaway>Kenneth Kurtz,">Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA>Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA>Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0464/index.html
2016,Episodic memory as a prerequisite for online updates of model structure,"Human learning in complex environments critically depends on the ability to perform model selection, that is to assess competing hypotheses about the structure of the environment. Importantly, information is accumulated continuously, which necessitates an online process for model selection. While model selection in human learning has been explored extensively, it is unclear how memory systems support learning in an online setting. We formulate a semantic learner and demonstrate that online learning on open model spaces results in a delicate choice between either tracking a possibly infinite number of competing models or retaining experiences in an intact form. Since none of these choices is feasible for a bounded-resource memory system, we propose an episodic learner that retains an optimised subset of experiences in addition to semantic memory. On a simple model system we demonstrate that this normative theory of episodic memory can effectively circumvent the challenge of online model selection.",>David Gergely Nagy>Gergo Orban,>Wigner RCP>Wigner RCP,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0465/index.html
2016,Stop paying attention: the need for explicit stopping in inhibitory control,"Inhibitory control, the ability to stop inappropriate actions, is an important cognitive function often investigated via the stop-signal task, in which an infrequent stop signal instructs the subject to stop a default go response. Previously, we proposed a rational decision-making model for stopping, suggesting the observer makes a repeated Go versus Wait choice at each instant, so that a Stop response is realized by repeatedly choosing to Wait. We propose an alternative model here that incorporates a third choice, Stop. Critically, unlike the Wait action, choosing the Stop action not only blocks a Go response at the current moment but also for the remainder of the trial -- the disadvantage of losing this flexibility is balanced by the benefit of not having to pay attention anymore. We show that this new model both reproduces known behavioral effects and has internal dynamics resembling presumed Go neural activations in the brain.",>Ning Ma>Angela Yu,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0466/index.html

This paper investigates whether children are sensitive to the meaning of the multiplicative structure. We designed a novel word learning paradigm and taught 4- to 6-year-old children the meaning of a novel numeral phrase (e.g., ‘one gobi houses’ to mean a group of three houses). We then asked whether they could generalize it to a novel context (e.g., ‘two gobi butterflies’ to mean two groups of three). Experiment 1 showed that only English-speaking children who received multiplier syntax training were able to generalize. Experiment 2 extended findings from Experiment 1 to Cantonese-speaking children and found that they could also generalize a novel multiplier to novel contexts. These results suggest that children as young as 4 can create a mapping between the structure of complex numerals and a multiplicative meaning.",>Pierina Cheung>Meghan Dale>Mathieu Le Corre,>Wesleyan University>Queen's University>Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0467/index.html

Across multiple neuroimaging studies, processing action verbs correlates with somatotopic activity in premotor cortex (PMC). Yet, only one neurostimulation study supports a functional role for PMC in action verb understanding: paradoxically, inhibiting PMC made people respond faster to action verbs. Here we investigated effects of PMC excitation and inhibition on action verb understanding using tDCS. Right-handers received excitatory or inhibitory stimulation to left PMC hand areas, then made lexical decisions on unimanual action verbs and abstract verbs. tDCS polarity selectively affected how accurately participants responded to unimanual action verbs. Inhibitory stimulation to left PMC caused a relative increment in performance for right-hand responses, whereas excitatory left PMC stimulation caused a relative decrement. tDCS polarity did not differentially affect responses to abstract verbs.

However, there is evidence for the existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans; and there is further evidence pointing to distinct higher-level problem solving systems shared by humans and other primates. To clarify the nature of these proposed systems and examine how they may interact in the brain, we present a four-level model of the primate brain and compare its performance to three other brain models in the face of a challenging foraging problem (i.e., with transparent, and thus, invisible barriers). In all manipulations (e.g., size of problem space, number of obstacles), our model never performed the best outright; however, it was always among the best, appearing to be a jack-of-all-trades.

The existing theoretical accounts of how labels influence what we learn range from facilitation to overshadowing, with changes occurring over development. Studies investigating how labels influence what people learn have typically been confined to a category learning framework, where participants were tasked to learn how to discriminate categories or infer missing category properties. Here, we investigate how the absence or presence of labels, both common and unique, alter how people attend and what they remember in a more general setting. Our results suggest that unique labels may promote visual exploration of objects; whereas, there was no evidence to support the claim that hearing the same label associated with different members of a to-be-learned category directed attention to common features.",>Samuel Rivera>Chris Robinson,">The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0470/index.html

Learners can accelerate this process by relying on words with native-language overlap, such as cognates. For bilingual third language learners, it is necessary to determine how their two existing languages interact during novel language learning. A scaffolding account predicts transfer from either language for individual words, whereas an accumulation account predicts cumulative transfer from both languages. To compare these accounts, twenty English-German bilingual adults were taught an artificial language containing 48 novel written words that varied orthogonally in English and German wordlikeness (neighborhood size and orthotactic probability). Wordlikeness in each language improved word production accuracy, and similarity to one language provided the same benefit as dual-language overlap. In addition, participants' memory for novel words was affected by the statistical distributions of letters in the novel language. Results indicate that bilinguals utilize both languages during third language acquisition, supporting a scaffolding learning model.",>James Bartolotti>Viorica Marian,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0471/index.html

Does this intuition carry over into folk philosophy of mind? In a series of large-scale studies, we explore intuitive distinctions among different kinds of mental phenomena and consider how these distinctions might organize the conceptual space of the diverse “intelligent” and “social” entities in the modern world. Across studies, independent exploratory factor analyses reveal a common latent structure underlying mental capacity attributions, centered on three types of phenomenal experiences: physiological experiences of biological needs (e.g., hunger, pain); social-emotional experiences of self- and other-relevant emotions (e.g., guilt, pride); and perceptual-cognitive abilities to detect and use information about the environment (e.g., hearing, memory). We argue for an expanded model of folk philosophy of mind that goes beyond agency and experience (H. M.

Previous research has shown that interindividual skill differences predict a group’s collective benefit in joint perceptual decision-making. In the present study, we tested whether this relationship also holds for other task domains, using a dynamic object control task in which two participants each controlled either the vertical or horizontal movement direction of an object. Our findings demonstrate that the difference in individuals’ skill levels was highly predictive of the dyad’s collective benefit. Differences in individuals’ subjective ratings of task difficulty reflected skill differences and thus also turned out to be a predictor of collective benefit. Generally, collective benefit was modulated by spatial task demands. Overall, the present study shows that previous findings in joint decision-making can be extended to dynamic motor tasks such as joint object control.",>Basil Wahn>Laura Schmitz>Peter König>Günther Knoblich,">University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, Germany>Central European University, Budapest, Hungary>University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, Germany>Central European University, Budapest, Hungary",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0473/index.html

The direction of both the mental timeline (MTL) and the mental number line (MNL) are widely assumed to depend on the direction of reading and writing within a culture. Although experimental evidence supports this assumption regarding the MTL, there is no clear evidence that reading direction determines the direction of the MNL. Here we tested effects of reading experience on the direction of both the MTL and MNL. Participants read English text either normally (from left to right) or mirror-reversed (from right to left). After normal reading, participants showed the space-time associations and space-number associations typical of Westerners. After mirror reading, participants’ space-time associations were significantly reduced but their space-number associations were unchanged.

By exploring the dynamics of comparable linguistic, technological, and artistic experimental tasks, we test the effect of domain-specific function on evolutionary mechanisms such as inheritance, innovation, and selection. We find evidence that cultural domain shapes both the structure of the traditions and the way the cultural-evolutionary mechanisms operate. The simplifying effects of cultural transmission are noticeable in language and technology, but not in art; innovation is highest in art and lowest in language; and functional pressures lead to different morphological adaptations across domains. This speaks of a crucial role of function and domain in the evolution of culture.",>Monica Tamariz>Simon Kirby>Jon W.

Hence, such models rely on the ingenuity of the modeler to establish a mapping of real-time stimulus to the model’s input which may not preserve processing that happens during each time step. We present a neural field model which successfully replicates the effect of immediate auditory repetition of monosyllabic words and fits it to a component of a well-studied mechanism for analyzing language processing, the event-related potential (ERP).

2016,Talking with tact: Polite language as a balance between informativity and kindness,"Conveying information in a false or indirect manner in consideration of listeners' wants (i.e., being polite) seemingly contradicts an important goal of a cooperative speaker: information transfer. We propose that a cooperative speaker considers both ""epistemic utility,"" or utility of providing the listener new information, and ""social utility,"" or utility of maintaining or boosting the listener's self-image (being polite). We formalize this tradeoff within a probabilistic model of language understanding and test it with empirical data on people's inferences about the relation between a speaker's goals, utterances and the true states of the world.",>Erica J.

2016,"Understanding ""almost"": Empirical and computational studies of near misses","When did something almost happen? In this paper, we investigate what brings counterfactual worlds close. In Experiments 1 and 2, we find that participants' judgments about whether something almost happened are determined by the causal proximity of the alternative outcome. Something almost happened, when a small perturbation to the relevant causal event would have been sufficient to bring it about. In contrast to previous work that has argued that prior expectations are neglected when judging the closeness of counterfactual worlds (Kahneman & Varey, 1990), we show in Experiment 3 that participants are more likely to say something almost happened when they didn't expect it. Both prior expectations and causal distance influence judgments of ""almost"". In Experiment 4, we show how both causal proximity and beliefs about what would have happened in the absence of the cause jointly explain judgments of ""almost caused"" and ""almost prevented"".",>Tobias Gerstenberg>Josh Tenenbaum,>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0478/index.html
2016,Tit-for-Tat: Effects of Feedback and Speaker Reliability on Listener Comprehension Effort,"Miscommunication is often seen as a detrimental aspect of human communication. However, miscommunication can differ in cause as well as severity. What distinguishes a miscommunication where conversation partners continue to put forth the effort from miscommunication where conversation partners simply give up? In this eye-tracking study, participants heard globally ambiguous statements that were either a result of an experimental error or speaker underspecification; participants either received positive or negative feedback on these ambiguous trials. We found that negative feedback, paired with the reliability of the message, will impact the amount of processing effort a comprehender puts forth—specifically, listeners were less forgiving of errors when they were penalized and when speakers’ instructions lacked effort. This suggests that language users weigh conversational contexts and outcomes as well as linguistic content during communication.",>Nicole Craycraft>Zoe Kriegel>Michael Tanenhaus>Jennifer Roche,>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign>Kent State University>University of Rochester>Kent State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0479/index.html
2016,"Distinguishing processing difficulties in inhibition, implicature, and negation","Despite their considerable communicative abilities, young children often have difficulty interpreting complex linguistic structures in context. Two examples of this phenomenon are negation and pragmatic implicature, both of which pose sometimes surprising difficulties for preschoolers. Both of these structures require children to resist a more salient alternative interpretation; since executive function abilities develop extensively during childhood, perhaps failures are due to problems in inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we designed speeded tasks to measure inhibitory control, negation, and implicature comprehension in children and adults. Using standard analyses as well as drift diffusion models, we found different patterns of processing on all three tasks, and no support for the hypothesis that inhibitory control per se is playing a role in either adults' or children's negation or implicature processing. Instead, our analyses reveal qualitatively different developmental trajectories for each task, suggesting task-specific factors driving these changes.",>Ann Nordmeyer>Erica Yoon>Mike Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States>Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0480/index.html
2016,Answering Causal Queries about Singular Cases,"Queries about singular causation face two problems: It needs to be decided whether the two observed events are instantiations of a generic cause-effect relation. Second, causation needs to be distinguished from co-incidence. We propose a computational model that addresses both questions. It accesses generic causal knowledge either on the individual or the group level. Moreover, the model addresses the possibility of a coincidence by adopting Cheng and Novick’s (2005) power PC measure of causal responsibility. This measure delivers the conditional probability that a cause is causally responsible for an effect given that both events have occurred. To take uncertainty about both the causal structure and the parameters into account we embedded the causal responsibility measure within the structure induction (SI) model developed by Meder et al. (2014). We report the results of three experiments that show that the SI model better captures the data than the power PC model.",>Simon Stephan>Michael R.

2016,The Impact of Granularity on the Effectiveness of Students' Pedagogical Decisions,"In this study we explored the impact of student versus tutor pedagogical decision-making on learning. We examined this impact at two levels of granularity: problem vs. step. 279 students were randomly assigned to four conditions and the domain content and required steps were strictly controlled to be equivalent across four conditions. The only differences among them were decision agency {Student vs. Tutor} and granularity {Problem vs. Step}. Our results showed a significant interaction effect between decision agency and granularity. That is, step level decisions can be more effective than problem level decisions but the students were more likely to make effective pedagogical decisions at problem level than step level. In general, on both problem and step levels, the students were significantly more likely to decide to do problem solving rather than study it as a worked example.",>Guojing Zhou>Collin Lynch>Thomas Price>Tiffany Barnes>Min Chi,>North Carolina State University>North Carolina State University>North Carolina State University>North Carolina State University>North Carolina State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0482/index.html
2016,Can Musical Engagement Alleviate Age-Related Decline in Inhibitory Control?,"The purpose of our study was to determine whether active musical engagement alleviates decline in inhibitory control due to cognitive aging. Given that musical training in young adults improves attentional performance, we can expect this benefit to persist for older adults as well. With the help of the stop-signal procedure, we measured response inhibition of young and older adults who provided a self-reported assessment of their musical engagement, using the recently validated Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index. The Gold-MSI addresses a variety of musical activities and thus offers a more comprehensive measure than ability to play a musical instrument used in the past. Results of the experiment showed that older participants had longer stop-signal reaction times, independently of their musical training and engagement, but musical training and ensemble practice were negatively related to the proportion of missed responses suggesting a weak effect of certain types of musical activities on inhibitory control.",>Ruben Vromans>Marie Postma-Nilsenova,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0483/index.html

2016,The distorting effect of deciding to stop sampling,"People usually collect information to serve specific goals and often end up with samples that are unrepresentative of the underlying population. This can introduce biases on later judgments that generalize from these samples. Here we show that goals influence not only what information we collect, but also when we decide to terminate search. Using an optimal stopping analysis, we demonstrate that even when learners have no control over the content of a sample (i.e., natural sampling), the simple decision of when to stop sampling can yield sample distributions that are non-representative and could potentially bias future decision making. We test the prediction of these theoretical analyses with two behavioral experiments.",>Anna Coenen>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0485/index.html
2016,Inferring Individual Differences Between and Within Exemplar and Decision-Bound Models of Categorization,"Different models of categorization are often treated as competing accounts, but specific models are often used to understand individual differences, by estimating individual-level parameters. We develop an approach to understanding categorization that allows for individual differences both between and within models, using two prominent categorization models that make different theoretical assumptions: the Generalized Context Model (GCM) and General Recognition Theory (GRT). We develop a latent-mixture model for inferring whether an individual uses the GCM or GRT, while simultaneously allowing for the use of special-case simpler strategies. The GCM simple strategies involve attending to a single stimulus dimension, while the GRT simple strategies involve using unidimensional decision bounds. Our model also allows for simple contaminant strategies. We apply the model to four previously published categorization experiments, finding large and interpretable individual differences in the use of both models and specific strategies, depending on the nature of the stimuli and category structures.",>Irina Danileiko>Michael Lee,">University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, United States>University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0486/index.html
2016,Adults' guesses on probabilistic tasks reveal incremental representativeness biases,"Participants in most binary-choice tasks with multiple trials tend to probability-match (Vulkan, 2000) — i.e., provide re- sponses that match the probability distribution of the presented population. Given a single trial, however, participants usually choose the majority option (James & Koehler, 2011). By us- ing a method that visually presents the probabilities of the two competing options, we examine responses when participants are given only a single trial, and initial responses when partic- ipants are given multiple trials. While we still observe aggre- gate probability-matching in the multiple-trial condition, we find robust sequence effects in participants’ initial responses, including robust maximizing behavior on the first response. This suggests that both maximizing in single-trial experiments and aggregate probability-matching in multiple-trial ones can be explained by a single, underlying mechanism; one that seeks to provide a representative sample at each point during sequence generation.",>Habiba Azab>David Ruskin>Celeste Kidd,">Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of Rochester>Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of Rochester>Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Center for Visual Sciences, University of Rochester",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0487/index.html

2016,Cognition without behaviour: Cognitive functions in behaviourally non-responsive individuals,"Patients, which are completely non-responsive albeit awake (i.e., not in coma), were first described by the famous German neurologist Ernst Kretschmer (1940) who designate this condition “apallic syndrome” meaning that there is no cortical activity altogether. In his description of the syndrome, Kretschmer used such terms as panapraxia (i.e., the complete lack of all functions of action control) and panagnosia (i.e. the complete lack of all cognitive functions). In the 1970ies, the not less famous Scottish neurosurgeon Bryan Jennett proposed a new name “vegetative state” (VS) for the patients of the kind as depicted by Kretschmer. While the term “apallic” (Greek “without cortex”) referred to anatomical and physiological entities, “vegetative” suggests that the patients lack a “subjective world” in form of feelings, thoughts, sensations, etc., while their vital functions such as respiration and circulation remains intact. The latter fact, again, strongly distinguishes this condition from coma.",>Boris Kotchoubey,">University of Tübingen, Tübingen, BW, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0489/index.html

They make assumptions about the representation and organization of memory, as well as about performance and learning mechanisms that operate over these structures. They specifically do not include content that changes, whether rapidly through reasoning and problem solving or gradually through learning. However, we also know that humans are highly adaptive and that they can work on the same task in many different ways. This creates a tension between the desire to identify universals in human cognition and to explain the observed variation. Some architectures, like Soar and Epic, make few commitments except about knowledge representation and the basic cognitive cycle.

Participants completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient questionnaire (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001). To elicit gestures, participants did two tasks. In one, they explained spatial and social concepts. In another, they told the story of a cartoon. The dependent variable is the gesture rate (gestures per word), to account for individual differences in volubility. Participants completed a standardized vocabulary test.

Specifically, we build a deep neural network that learns a hierarchical generative model of sensory inputs. The results show that hidden layer activities can support the categorization of different geometric objects and distinguish among various spatial relationships between geometric figures. Specifically, hidden layer activities can be decoded to compare line orientations, detect right triangles, and judge whether two triangles are similar or not. We further analyze the response profiles of hidden layers units and find some units resembling parietal neurons in the brain.

The aims of this study were to investigate the implicit emotional processing of traumatic events and the moderation of priming by semantic level of the events, using primed naming task at short stimulus onset asynchrony (150ms). A 3 semantic level of traumatic primed events (general, domestic, or foreign words) by 3 target emotions (high-arousal negative, moderate positive, low-arousal negative words) repeated design was used. When the primed words were general (e.g. terror) or domestic (e.g. Sewol ferry disaster) events, response time of high-arousal negative words (e.g. fear or angry) were significantly longer than other emotion words (e.g. happy or sadness).

The free-form response strategy (FFR) presents participants with the premises and asks them ``what, if anything, follows?'' In the simplest case, participants' responses are coded as to whether they made the predicted inference. On the yes/no question strategy (YNQ), after presenting the premises, the researcher puts forth a sentence C and asks whether C follows from the premises. We compare the two methodologies with respect to six types of fallacious problems involving propositional connectives from the mental-models literature, to address the question of whether the methodologies are equally valid. We found that the two methodologies overwhelmingly yield identical results.

We explored how the statistical structure of events can be a source of object property learning. Twenty-five participants saw sequences of visual events surrounding two distinct objects. Object identity determined 1) the direction of a high transition probability between two events, and 2) the frequency of two other events. Learning was unsupervised and unguided. However, participants spontaneously noticed these regularities. In an explicit, verbal judgment task, they discriminated between frequent vs. rare events (t(24) = 10.7, p< 0.00001) and between predictive vs. non-predictive event pairs (t(24) = 3.04, p<0.01), as appropriate to the object. These statistics gave rise to distinct conceptual interpretations: participants ascribed a causal interpretation to the predictive statistics (t(24) = 1.91, p<0.05) more than to events frequently co-occurring with the objects (t(24) = 3.00, p<0.01).

2016,Filling in the gaps: Event segmentation is robust to missing information,"Fluent event processing involves segmenting streaming sensory information into discrete units. Adults and children selectively attend to these meaningful moments within event streams, which predicts later memory. In natural environments, however, uninterrupted attention is unlikely. Consequently, some information is missed, including event boundary information. To what extent does missing information alter the attentional dynamics of processing, specifically viewers’ ability to target remaining boundaries with enhanced attention? Adults advanced at their own pace through slideshows of unfolding activity. Slides were systematically deleted to enable comparison of viewers’ attentional dynamics when specific content was present versus absent. Average dwelling per slide increased with missing content. However, the attentional dynamics of processing were unaltered; attention to boundaries displayed comparable enhancement regardless of missing content. Attention modulation during processing of relatively familiar events appears to be highly robust to missing information.

In the experiment, the plausibility of the retracting information (low versus high) and the manner of correcting information (simple retraction versus supplying an alternative) were manipulated, and the participants were asked to answer memory questions and inference questions.

Participants were presented with novel objects belonging to four different categories and heard category labels in a cross-situational learning task. The four categories were matched for the total amount of exposure but varied in category size and shape of distribution. Participants learned object-to-label mappings better for categories with a skewed distribution of fewer objects. Moreover, object-to-label mapping performance was positively related to the ability to extend category knowledge to novel items. Co-occurrence frequency or category size alone were not good predictors of label learning and generalization.

In Experiment 1, children were given a puzzle task to complete in which they were either missing 2 pieces (experimental group) or not (control group). All children then received 2 puzzle pieces from a confederate, resulting in either necessary instrumental help (experimental group) or unnecessary help (control group). Children were more prosocial (shared a greater proportion of their resources) with the confederate after receiving instrumental help than after receiving unnecessary help. In Experiment 2, we investigated the types of principles children use when paying back help. We found that children employed a mix of exact reciprocation and “needs-based” help when paying back individuals.

2016,Heuristics in exploration: Distributional information is selectively used for active learning,"Everyday decision-making is filled with choices about what to act on, with outcomes playing a critical role in learning. Information gain is oft cited as a valuable approach to maximize potential learning, but its computation is costly. It entails evaluating the probability of multiple outcomes given any possible action, and then considering the degree of belief-change over all possibilities. Given the computational complexity of this evaluation, it becomes important to ask whether learners employ cues to information gain; are there heuristics that drive choice in active learning? Our experiments ask participants to choose between two options (varying in distributional characteristics) in either a “learning-condition” or “collecting-condition”. Our results suggest that adults are sensitive to cues (e.g. variance) that tend to correlate with information gain. These cues are only favored in learning-goal contexts, suggesting that certain distributional qualities are not always appealing, but rather are selectively-employed heuristics towards information gain.",>Elizabeth Lapidow>Elizabeth Bonawitz,>Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0504/index.html
2016,On the psychological reality of linguistic event structures,"How language represents meaning remains a central topic of debate in linguistics. On some accounts, the noun phrases in a sentence are identified semantically by a list of independent atomic labels (thematic roles), ordered relative to one another depending on the position of the nouns around the verb (e.g., AGENT-THEME-GOAL). Others instead capture such interdependencies with complex, non-atomic event structures (e.g., [x CAUSE [y TO-COME-TO-BE-AT z]]). Here, we use structural priming to investigate the psychological reality of these two theories of semantic representation. On the thematic role approach, we should expect to see priming between theme-first locatives and prepositional-object datives (both VP-NP-PP syntactically) precisely because their thematic ordering is consistent across the two constructions. The event structure approach posits no such minimal semantic structural similarity, such that we should not see priming cross-constructionally. We find only within-construction priming (N=52) and not across-construction priming (total N=344), in favor of event structures.",>Jayden Ziegler>Jesse Snedeker,>Harvard University>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0505/index.html
2016,Effects of Analogical Processing: Evidence for Re-representation,"Re-representation is a mechanism for aligning non-identical structurally corresponding predicates during comparison. Re-representation is therefore a shift in the encoding of a stimulus from an initial set of elements to an altered set. For example, when comparing two analogous sentences, different verbs could be re-represented to allow a match – thereby altering construal. Re-representation is theoretically and intuitively compelling, but difficult to demonstrate. We had participants compare pairs of short text passages and judge them as potential analogies. At test, participants read an altered version of a prior passage and were asked to detect changes from the original. The alterations increased the semantic match between the passage and its analog. Participants who had compared the original passage to the analog were less likely to detect changes than those who compared to a non-analogous passage. As would be expected due to re-representation, analogical comparison made participants less sensitive to the changes.",>Daniel Silliman>Kenneth Kurtz,">Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, United States>Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0506/index.html
2016,A computational theory of temporal inference,"We describe a novel model-based theory of how individuals reason deductively about temporal relations. It posits that temporal assertions refer to mental models -- iconic representations of possibilities -- of events (Khemlani, Harrison, & Trafton, 2015; Schaeken, Johnson-Laird, & d'Ydewalle, 1996). In line with recent accounts of spatial reasoning (Ragni & Knauff, 2013), the theory posits that individuals tend to build a single preferred model of a temporal description. The more models necessary to yield a correct answer, the harder that problem is. The theory is implemented in a computer program, mReasoner, which draws temporal deductions by building models. It varies four separate factors in the process: the size of a model, its contents, the propensity to consider alternative models, and the propensity to revise initial conclusions. Two studies corroborated the predictions of the theory and its computational implementation. We conclude by discussing temporal and relational inference more broadly.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Anthony Harrison>Greg Trafton,>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0507/index.html
2016,An interactive model accounts for both ultra-rapid superordinate classification and basic-level advantage in object recognition,"While people are faster to categorize objects at an intermediate or basic level of specificity (e.g. “bird”), several recent studies have shown them to have much earlier access to more general category information (e.g. “animal”). Ultra-rapid superordinate classification has been taken as evidence that recognition processes are largely feed-forward. In simulations with a deep neural network model, we show that this conclusion does not follow: even a model that is fully recurrent and interactive shows ultra-rapid superordinate classification patterns when tested with analogs of behavioral tasks such as rapid serial visual presentation or deadline classification. Moreover, this recurrent model explains recently-observed similarities and differences in the time-course of classification as estimated by electro-encephlography (EEG) versus human electro-corticography (ECoG), and also account for the well-known basic-level advantage in non-speeded classification. These results provide evidence that ultra-rapid and unconstrained visual object recognition is supported by interactive processes in the brain.",>Qihong Lu>Timothy Rogers,">University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0508/index.html
2016,Handedness and Mathematics: Toward a More Comprehensive Model,"The relationship between handedness and mathematical abilities is controversial. Whilst some researchers have claimed that left-handers are gifted in mathematics and strong right-handers perform the worst in mathematical tasks, it has been more recently proposed that mixed-handers are actually the most disadvantaged group. To disentangle these discrepancies, we conducted five experiments in several Italian schools (total participants: N = 2,308) involving students of different ages (6 to 17 years) and a range of mathematical tasks. The results showed that (a) the percentage of variance in mathematics scores explained by handedness was moderate (about 5%) but statistically significant, and (b) the shape of the relationship between handedness and mathematical ability depended on age, task, and gender. We concluded that the different outcomes reported in the literature probably reflected the dissimilarities between the studies about the above variables. Therefore, a more comprehensive model is needed, which explains how these variables interact.",>Giovanni Sala>Martina Bolognese>Giulia Barsuola>Michela Signorelli>Fernand Gobet,">University of Liverpool, UK>University of Milan, ITA>University of Milan, ITA>University of Milan, ITA>University of Liverpool, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0509/index.html
2016,Shifting meanings: The fluidity of signal-meaning mappings in a minimal communicative task,"We used a non-linguistic experimental paradigm to explore the instantaneous creation of new communicative conventions. Participants played a computer game, in which they sent and interpreted minimal signals to obtain shared rewards within a virtual scene. Trials manipulated the space of possible signals that could be sent, and the meanings to be expressed (locations and quantities of rewards); as such, optimal success in the task required participants to jointly construct signal-meaning mappings that functioned as part of a system, rather than in isolation. We observed different signalling strategies among participants, but with some individuals using ‘system-mapping’ conventions that globally reorganized in light of changing task constraints. Such behaviour reflects the principle of pre-emption in pragmatics, where the inferred meaning of an utterance depends on its relationship among a set of alternatives. Our initial findings provide a basis for future research, investigating contexts that are conducive to this phenomenon.",>Jennifer Misyak>Takao Noguchi>Nick Chater,>University of Warwick>University College London>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0510/index.html

Action models were presented that comprised four elements: using right or left hand, using right or left stick, tapping right or left side of a box, and placing a stick on right or left side. In the condition in which identical elements of video stimuli and manipulated objects placed in front of participants had the same color, the colored element was correctly performed compared to the condition with different colored elements. However, colored element was not correctly performed in the condition in which particular elements of video stimuli were colored, whereas manipulated objects were not colored. These results suggest the important role of the process occurring after the visual input.",>Takashi Mizuguchi,>Shinshu University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0511/index.html
2016,Reduced benefit from regularities in language among Dyslexics,"The ""Anchoring Deficit"" hypothesis (Ahissar et al., Nat Neurosci. 2006) proposed that Dyslexics have a difficulty in automatic extraction of simple stimulus regularities in sound sequences. JaffeDax et al. (J Neurosci. 2015) modelled these difficulties as yielding noisy priors. The current study was aimed to assess the impact of long-term regularities in language, which listeners had life long experience with. Our assumption was that this familiarity would enhance Controls' performance more than Dyslexics' due to a noisier prior formation among Dyslexics. This question was addressed in a series of experiments - in each there was one condition for which information accumulated over the life span could be utilized. In all three experiments Dyslexics did not benefit as much as Controls from the long term statistics associated with the input. These results suggest that Dyslexics could not compensate for the deficit despite multiple exposures to lingual input with the same statistics.",>Eva Kimel>Merav Ahissar,>PhD student at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem>Professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0512/index.html
2016,How the Physicality of Space Affects How We Think about Time,"Time is an abstract concept that is better understood when it is mapped onto space. One mechanism to accomplish this mapping is a reference frame. Previous research has shown the orientation and direction parameters of a spatial reference frame are involved in understanding time. For example, for English speakers, time is organized horizontally and runs from left (past) to right (future). The current experiments focus on the scale parameter. Experiment 1 changes temporal scale across trials, and illustrates that the scale parameter is set, as evidenced by a cost when the parameter value changes. Experiment 2 examines the correspondence between the spatial scale and the temporal scale, requiring participants to map small or large temporal distances to small or large spatial distances. The results illustrate flexibility in this mapping. Together these experiments support the idea that all the parameters of a spatial reference frame are used when understanding time.",>Jennifer Kolesari>Laura Carlson,">University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, 46556>University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, 46556",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0513/index.html
2016,Embodiment Effects in Evolutionary Robotics,"We evolve simple neural network controllers in swimming robots in order to test the hypothesis that, given distinct dimensions of control for the tail structure, evolution will favor the emergence of modular neural networks as most likely to enhance fitness (successful light harvesting). Evolution does lead to improved fitness, but this does not appear to result from increases in modularity. However, an unexpected result highlights the importance of embodiment for the evolution of the agent. The output of the neural network controller is high frequency with many extreme excursions, but the actual movements of the tail are damped by the physics of the body as it interacts with the aquatic environment. Subsequent simulations establish the role of these physical parameters in dampening noisy network controller output. Thus, morphology can increase evolvability by acting as a low pass filter of high-frequency controller dynamics.",>Nicholas Livingston>Anton Bernatskiy>Kenneth Livingston>Marc Smith>Jodi Schwarz>Joshua Bongard>David Wallach>Evan Altiero>John Long,>Vassar College>University of Vermont>Vassar College>Vassar College>Vassar College>University of Vermont>Vassar College>Vassar College>Vassar College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0514/index.html
2016,Perception of math and non-math content in children's storybooks,"Young children acquire informal math ideas through everyday experiences. Research demonstrates that storybooks can link their informal notions to abstract concepts (Murphy, 1999). The integration of visual and written depictions of mathematics, along with conversations arising from the story, can bolster children’s capacity to communicate and think mathematically. Despite the growing literature supporting use of math storybooks, little is understood about how educators perceive and interpret the embedded math content. Our study presents storybook pages to educators and asks questions to determine whether they are more likely to identify concepts in math (e.g., number) or non-math (e.g., vocabulary) domains. We also analyze the association between domain and the degree of abstraction in the language used to describe content in that domain. Preliminary data suggest that educators ask questions about number concepts at higher levels than expected and character’s actions at lower levels than expected.",>Colleen Uscianowski>Ma.

2016,Your Obstacle on My Mind: Task Co-representation in Coordination is Modulated by External Timing Cues,"When acting in a social context, people have an automatic tendency to represent another person’s task – to the extent that another’s task constraints may influence one’s own movement performance. Task co-representation will also affect co-actors’ performance in joint action coordination; however, how exactly movement parameters are influenced is unclear. We investigated this question in four experiments. Pairs of participants performed arm movements back and forth between two targets, instructed to synchronize their landing times while external metronome tones provided timing cues. We predicted that actors would represent their co-actors’ task constraints such that when the co-actor moved over an obstacle the actor without obstacle would move higher as well. Results confirmed this prediction, suggesting that joint action partners co-represented each other’s task constraints. Moreover, this obstacle effect increased significantly when timing cues were removed, indicating a stronger need for co-representing the partner when demands on interpersonal coordination are amplified.",>Laura Schmitz>Cordula Vesper>Natalie Sebanz>Guenther Knoblich,">Central European University, Budapest, Hungary>Central European University, Budapest , Hungary>Central European University, Budapest, Hungary>Central European University, Budapest, Hungary",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0516/index.html

Experimental sessions included the completion of the number comparison task along with concurrent EEG measures. We then used a dynamic systems model with evolutionary algorithm updating to predict behavior for each participant independently. The computational model approximated neural coding of number by calculating tuning curves implemented through multilayered dynamic systems architecture. Typically dynamical systems models of cognition have fixed parameters tailored to the particular task being modeled and selected by the researcher. The models used were designed to adapt such that each participant’s model is individually customized to their particular data.

2016,The role of viewpoint in event segmentation,"The ability to perceive and understand experience is influenced by a process that divides it into meaningful parts. This process, called event segmentation, is frequently studied by asking participants to identify meaningful units of activity in films that depict it from a third person perspective. However, because segmentation is associated with changes in the perceptual and conceptual features of film, it could differ for films that present the same activity from a first person perspective. This study therefore examined segmentation for simultaneously recorded films that depicted identical activities from different perspectives. In several experiments participants were asked to segment these movies into natural and meaningful units of activity. Measures of segmentation frequency and agreement provided little evidence that segmentation reliably differed across first and third person perspectives. These preliminary findings suggest that participants identify similar events when they are viewed from different perspectives.",>Khena Swallow>Ayse Candan>Jovan Kemp,">Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853>Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853>Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0518/index.html
2016,Individual differences in verbalization predict change detection performance: A new perspective on the language-thought debate,"The question of whether language affects nonlinguistic processes remains unresolved. Whereas many studies find that effects of language on such processes are disrupted when verbalization is inhibited, others show that they persist. We explored individual differences in the tendency to verbalize as a potential resolution to this discrepancy. We hypothesized that if language is spontaneously accessed during nonlinguistic tasks, individual differences in verbalization should predict task performance. Participants completed a visual change-detection task and the Verbalizer-Visualizer Questionnaire (VVQ), a self-report measure of cognitive styles linked to modality-specific neural systems. We found that higher scores on the “verbalizer” dimension of the VVQ predicted faster but less accurate change detection. These results suggest that some individuals are more likely than others to use language when performing tasks that do not require it, and hence that effects of language on nonlinguistic processes are more likely to be observed in such individuals.",>Junko Kanero>Eileen Kitrick>Kathy Hirsh-Pasek>Kevin Holmes,">Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA>Colorado College, Colorado Springs, CO, USA>Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA>Colorado College, Colorado Springs, CO, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0519/index.html

The present study examined whether subliminal hints may influence not only retention of the goals but also planning of sequential steps required to solve the nine-dot problem. Using continuous flash suppression, participants were subliminally presented with either an image depicting the entire solution of the problem, the three steps to solve the problem in a sequential order, or an image of the nine dots that does not involve solution of the problem. Participants presented with the entire solution of the problem tended to show better solution performance and greater relaxation of constraints than those in the latter two conditions, whose performance failed to significantly differ from each other. These results indicate that subliminal information may be stored as a global and static visuo-spatial representation to influence solution but may not involve planning of each step to achieve insight problem solving.",>Hiromitsu Miyata>Hiroaki Suzuki,">The University of Tokyo>Aoyama Gakuin University, Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0520/index.html

P3 latency in the incongruent condition was identical in patients and controls in ST but strongly delayed in patients compared with controls in EFT. A significant positive lateralized readiness potential indicating the activation of the false response channel was obtained in the incongruent condition of EFT, being significantly larger in patients than controls.

2016,Biased Attention to Spatial Dimensions Predicts Children’s Spatial Word Acquisition,"Children’s spatial language abilities relate to their spatial skills. We propose that this relation arises from attention to spatial dimensions influencing both spatial word and spatial skill acquisition. This study tests whether attending to spatial dimensions in a word learning task predicts spatial vocabulary. Three to 5-year-olds completed a novel word assessment testing categorization of angles, shapes, and a test of spatial vocabulary. In the novel word assessment, children were presented with an exemplar angle with a novel label and asked to select another angle sharing the label. Foils matched the exemplar in degree, orientation, color, or size. Significant age differences occurred in children’s bias to select foils based on angle degree (but no age differences occurred in exemplar choices based on shape). Children showing an angle bias had significantly higher spatial vocabulary than those who did not. These findings show that attending to relevant spatial dimensions predicts spatial vocabulary.",>Hilary Miller>Haley Vlach,">University of Wisconsin Madison>University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0522/index.html

The Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT) technique was used to measure how strongly various colors are associated with anger, sadness, happiness, fear, envy, shame and shyness. The results showed that some metaphorical associations like red-anger are common in both English and Chinese speakers, whereas other associations are culturally-specific (e.g., red is also associated with happiness in Chinese, while only English individuals associate blue with sadness). Some interesting gender differences were also obtained, such that Chinese females associate shyness with pink, but males with red. Black was associated with fear in both genders in Chinese, but only present in English males. This study thus demonstrates that the conceptual representations of different emotions are shaped by an individual’s linguistic and cultural experience.",>Junqing Chen>Natalie Kacinik>Yingjun Chen>Nianyang Wu,">The Graduate Center and Brooklyn College, CUNY, New York, NY, USA>Brooklyn College, CUNY, Brooklyn, NY, USA>Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China>Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0524/index.html

Previous research found links between noun feature distinctiveness and age of acquisition (i.e. nouns referring to objects with relatively unique features are learned earlier). The present work investigates the links between feature distinctiveness and age of acquisition in verbs. Using high-dimensional vector space modelling, noun and verb feature distinctiveness was represented as Manhattan distance between word nodes. Both nouns and verbs showed negative correlations between feature distinctiveness and age of acquisition (words of more distinctive objects learned earlier), suggesting a general distinctiveness bias. This effect was stronger for nouns. An investigation of child directed speech (CDS) from the CHILDES corpus showed a correlation between child directed word frequency and feature distinctiveness for nouns (featurally distinctive nouns are more common in CDS), but not for verbs.

Our main prediction was that it would be easier to imagine completed (I had built the fence.) than ongoing events (I was building the fence.) because accomplishments include natural temporal end points. Slow cortical brain potentials were examined as an index of the difficulty associated with imagining. Our results showed that participants had more difficulty imagining ongoing than completed accomplishments, and that it was easier to imagine from the third- versus first-person perspective. The ability of participants to imagine from different visual perspectives was not influenced by grammatical aspect. Participants indicated that the people in their imagined events were more vivid when they imagined ongoing versus completed accomplishments, as well as when they imagined from a third- versus first-person perspective. As expected, grammatical aspect influenced which temporal components of events were imagined.",>Deanna Hall>Todd Ferretti>Jeffrey Hong,>Wilfrid Laurier University>Wilfrid Laurier University>Wilfrid Laurier University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0526/index.html
2016,A Cognitive Model of Fraction Arithmetic,"Learning about fractions is a critical step on the path to high school mathematics, yet many children never master basic knowledge such as fraction arithmetic procedures. To better understand these difficulties, the present study describes a computational model of fraction arithmetic problem solving. The model demonstrates that the majority of empirically observed errors over all four arithmetic operations can be explained by only two error-generating mechanisms – overgeneralization and repair. Further, by assuming probabilistic selection of solution procedures using associative strengths learned from experience, the model predicts two other empirical phenomena: (1) variation in error rates and relative frequencies of specific errors as a function of problem features, and (2) variable strategy selection within and between problems and individuals. Beyond providing a formal account of errors, the model was used to simulate the effects of variation of instructional parameters, leading to novel predictions regarding potentially effective instructional designs.",>David Braithwaite>Robert Siegler,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnege Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0527/index.html
2016,The role of regional topography in route planning,"When planning the most efficient route from one location to another, people tend to prefer southern routes over northern routes of equal length and complexity. This asymmetry has been attributed to implicit associations between cardinal direction and relative elevation (i.e., north = higher), and holds even when regional topography conflicts with these associations. No such asymmetry has been observed between eastern and western routes. Here we provide evidence for an eastern-western asymmetry in participants residing in an environment with east-west topography differences. Residents of Colorado Springs, CO, where topography is mountainous to the west, showed a reliable preference for eastern routes over equal-length western routes on a Colorado Springs map, but not an unfamiliar map. This pattern held even though the represented areas contain minimal elevation differences. Our findings suggest that regional topography can induce a novel, physically unfounded asymmetry in otherwise unbiased representations of the spatial environment.",>Andrew Deslauriers>Kevin Holmes,>Colorado College>Colorado College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0528/index.html
2016,Sign languages reveal spatial mappings of valence and magnitude,"Much research indicates that concepts of magnitude and valence are represented spatially, with more/less and positive/negative relations mapped to vertical and horizontal axes. While these mappings are sometimes manifested linguistically through conventional metaphors (e.g., ""prices fell""), recent evidence suggests that they may be built into the very forms of words -- traditionally assumed to be arbitrarily related to their meanings. Following previous research, we examined whether the directions of hand motions constituting words in two sign languages predicted the meanings of their English translation equivalents. Upward-moving signs were more positively valenced than downward-moving signs, as found previously, but were also greater in magnitude, or intensity. Additionally, rightward-moving signs (from the signer's perspective) were more positively valenced than leftward-moving signs, consistent with the bodily experience of right-handers. Our findings demonstrate systematic encoding of multiple spatial-conceptual mappings in words, adding to the growing literature showing non-arbitrary links between linguistic form and meaning.",>Eileen Kitrick>Kevin Holmes,>Colorado College>Colorado College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0529/index.html

This poster will present data from an ongoing study examining if 3.5- to 6.5-year-old children (current n=24) relate perceptions of effort and trust. Children watched two informants solving problems using different solutions, exerting either high or low effort. Children’s eye gaze, trust of each informant, and learning from informants were measured. There were no significant differences in trust of the two informants, but children were significantly more likely to learn the solution demonstrated by the high effort informant, t(23) = 2.161, p = 0.041. High effort informant trust was also significantly related to time spent looking at the high effort informant, r = 0.675, p < 0.01.

However, typical environments are not unisensory, and typical response decisions often involve multiple task domains. This study examines multisensory task-switching costs and the interactions of several variables, including perceptual modality of the cue, perceptual modality of the target task, type of task completed (i.e., spatial or identity decisions), and availability of foreknowledge. The design is marked by no redundant multisensory information and minimal memory demands. Performance costs varied as a function of whether participants had foreknowledge of upcoming task and/or modality presentation. Consistent with previous research, the current results also show that performance costs between tasks were significantly smaller (and essentially, eliminated) when the sensory modality of the task switched versus when it repeated.

How might this impact (a) memory and (b) understanding of novel topics? Foresight participants read about five psychology studies, including mean performance of one group; then they estimated the mean performance of another group and stated causes for the difference; finally, they received the second group’s actual performance. Hindsight participants learned about both groups’ performance at the beginning, then imagined what estimates and causes they would have indicated had they not seen actual means. A week later, half of each group recalled the means they had learned, and other half estimated means for a novel set of studies. We considered the extent to which: 1. foresight promotes long-term memories as opposed to providing an anchor that biases memories; 2. foresight cultivates a habit of considering alternative possible outcomes that might help one understand novel topics.",>Edward Munnich>Emma Weinberger>Ana Maria Hoffmann,>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0532/index.html
2016,From computation to automization: How practice alters initial neural response to familiar arithmetic problems,"Building and validating models of skill acquisition that explain speedup effects has been limited by difficulty distinguishing quickly executed cognitive processes (e.g. Anderson, 1982; Logan, 1988; Rickard, 1997). In this experiment, magnetoencephalography (MEG) data are collected from participants solving a repeated math problem set. We use MEG signal to test the three-phase model of skill acquisition that describes the transition from problem-solving strategies of computation, to retrieval, to an automatic stimulus-response process (Fitts & Posner, 1967). We hypothesize that the processes of familiarity and recollection are early features that distinguish the three phases of skill acquisition. Analyzing event-related fields, we test two predictions. First, early frontal activation (akin to the FN400 old-new effect of ERP studies) should diminish in strength with each successive phase transition. Second, parietal activation (corresponding to the ERP P600 old-new effect) should be present in the second phase, but not in the first or last phase.",>Caitlin Tenison>John Anderson,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0533/index.html

Current psychological research on magic has started to focus on how magicians are best able to elicit the observer reactions associated with their craft, such as what methods are most successful, as well as what cognitive mechanisms are specifically driving the observers’ reactions. However, while research examining the practice of magic from a psychological perspective has been expanding, few studies have looked at how cognitive individual differences influence an observer’s magic perceptions and experiences. In a collaboration with award-winning magician, Joshua Jay, we examined the impacts of Need for Cognition (NFC) and Need for Cognitive Closure (NFCC) on magic perceptions. Results showed that NFC and NFCC had opposite effects on engagement (i.e., rewatching and solution generation) and that frustration levels were behavior drivers for participants with high NFC or low NFCC.",>Lisa Grimm>Nicholas Spanola,>The College of New Jersey>The College of New Jersey,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0534/index.html

Previous work suggested that both noun and verb targets were significantly primed by the same grammatical class. However, when preceded by different grammatical class, verb but not noun targets showed priming. We attributed the asymmetrical priming to the materials used: noun stimuli were derived by their verb counterparts, suggesting an important inherent asymmetry between nouns and verbs. To further investigate this suggestion, we used materials with the opposite asymmetry (verbs derived by nouns) expecting an asymmetry in the opposite direction to emerge for derivationally related words. A clear explanation of the asymmetry would allow us conclusions about the (debated) existence of differences in representation and processing between inflectional and derivational morphological relations and thus provide evidence for or against a fully decompositional view of processing morphologically complex words.",>Sofia Loui>Athanassios Protopapas,>University of Athens; Athens Metropolitan College>University of Athens,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0535/index.html

In particular, one experiment (Medin & Schwanenflugel, 1981; E4) is viewed as the canonical demonstration that, when within- and between- category similarities are evenly matched, NLS classifications are not more difficult to acquire than linearly separable ones. The results of this study are somewhat at issue due to non-standard methodology and small sample size. We present a replication and extension of this classic experiment. We did not find any evidence of an advantage for linearly separable classifications. In fact, the marginal NLS advantage observed in the original study was strengthened: we found a significant advantage for the NLS classification.

Undergraduate students (N = 341) responded to nine questions representing the three domains or factors (psychological, biological, and physical), composing an overall measure of God’s anthropomorphic properties. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the structure of undergraduates’ anthropomorphic concept of God. Fit indices suggest acceptable model fit, χ2(24) = 73.09, p < .001, CFI= 0.952, SRMR= .051. All loadings were significant. Biological (0.99; 0.01) and physical (0.90; 0.19) factors loaded more strongly onto anthropomorphism, and had smaller variances, than the psychological (0.67; 0.56) factor. These findings suggest there are varied ways of conceptualizing the psychological (versus non-psychological) properties of God; thus, non-psychological properties are more predictive in God concepts.",>Nicholas Shaman>Anondah Saide>Rebekah Richert,">University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, United States>University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, United States>University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0537/index.html
2016,Do peer interactions influence infant communication development?,"Studying infants in daycare or school settings enables us to ask whether infants influence each others’ development, and if so, whether peer influences are similar to influences from adult caregivers. Answering these questions will not only inform infant educators but can also help us understand the mechanisms underlying infant learning. We have collected audio recordings from 21 1- to 21-month-old infants in two infant rooms in our campus early childhood education center. Recordings took place nearly every school day over a continuous 8 month period, for an average of 231 hours of recording per child. Multiple infants within the same room were recorded simultaneously. We will present our approach to synchronizing, coding, and analyzing these recordings toward the goal of understanding peer influences on vocal communication development, present preliminary results, and seek input on how to further analyze this large and unique dataset.",>Anne Warlaumont>Gina Pretzer,">The University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, USA>The University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0538/index.html
2016,How event endstates are conceptualized in adults and infants,"Many event descriptions are true only when the event comes to its natural end point: e.g., a “feeding” event culminates when the feed-ee has eaten, not simply when food is provided. Do non-linguistic event conceptualizations reflect attention to natural culmination points? We tested adults and 14-month-olds to ask: provided two events with the same ACTION but different ENDPOINTs - one a naturally expected result, the other only partially achieved - do adults and infants perceive them as members of the same event category or of different categories? Adults were asked to rate the similarity between the two events; infants were habituated to one event and tested for dishabituation when it was switched to the other. Adult data suggest the difference between a complete and a partially-complete event is registered, and carries more psychological weight than a mere perceptual difference. Infant data (ongoing) will show the developmental origin of such conceptualizations.",>Angela Xiaoxue He>Sudha Arunachalam,">Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States>Boston University, Boston, MA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0539/index.html
2016,ADHD modulates link between event processing and recall,"How might ADHD symptomatology influence adults’ ability to process and recall the actions of others? University undergraduates observed a woman packing a suitcase by advancing through a self-paced slide show of still images extracted from a digital video, and were then asked to recall as many actions as possible. Results showed that lower self-reported retrospective ADHD symptomatology was associated with a) longer overall dwelling on images from the slideshow, r(91) = -.315, p=.002, and b) recall of more actions r(85) = -.237, p=01. Further, exploratory analyses indicated that ADHD symptomatology modulated the specific linkage between dwell time patterns and stronger recall: Attention to fine-grain details within activity improved recall for those reporting higher ADHD symptomatology; those reporting lower ADHD symptomatology displayed stronger recall when prioritizing attention at a more coarse-grain level, F(1,83) = 4.19, p=.04. These findings offer suggestive novel evidence that ADHD has implications for event processing.",>Robbie Ross>Leah Child>Dare Baldwin,">University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, United States>University of Chicago, Chicago, IL>University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0540/index.html
2016,The sequence of study changes what is encoded during category learning.,"This work investigates how the sequence of study influences encoding and memory for different properties of the categories studied. We used a transfer task with different types of items and show that following blocked study learners are sensitive to category properties that were presented frequently in the category (but were not diagnostic of category membership). However, following interleaved study learners do not seem to be sensitive to changes on these non-diagnostic properties. Moreover, when asked to judge different properties for their relevance for category learning (cue and category validity), participants rate discriminating properties more highly than similarities following interleaved study, but not following blocked study. These results are consistent with previous evidence and are captured by an exemplar model that takes into account the sequence of exemplars during learning by changing the likelihood of attending to and encoding different object properties depending on sequential similarities.",>Paulo Carvalho>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0541/index.html
2016,Finding Clarity Amidst the Clutter: How Parents Name Objects,"A core issue in the study of word learning is understanding how beginning learners cope with referential ambiguity in the clutter of natural learning environments, and how parents may help them find the referent in that clutter. Here we ask how sensitive parents are in taking advantage of optimal visual moments where a single object is visually large in view to provide linguistic labels for their infants. Using a mini-head camera, we recorded parent-child free play interactions and studied the parent naming events for 12 and 30 month old children from the infant-perspective in a context of high clutter (30 objects dumped on the floor). Despite the cluttered context, parents and infants frequently created infant-perspective scenes in which one object was visually singled out. At both age levels, parents named objects in these moments of visual clarity and almost never named objects in sub-optimal moments.",>Charlene Tay>Linda B.

2016,Relational discovery in category learning: interactions of learning strategy and task structure,"Often failures of problem solving on educational assessments are failures of problem categorization. That is, when reasoners do not properly classify a novel problem they do not know what solution to apply. For example, often physics students do not recognize the underlying commonalities in the relationships among the variables in different problems concerning Newton’s laws of motion (Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981). Addressing this challenge there have been separate lines of research examining 1. how differences in students’ learning strategies or cognitive abilities affects their propensity to discover relational commonalities (e.g., Little & MacDaniel, 2015) and 2. how variations in task structure change the likelihood of successful categorization (e.g., Roher & Pashler, 2010). However, relatively little research has examined whether the optimal task structure depends on the learner’s strategy or ability. Across several experiments, we demonstrate multiple dependencies between the effectiveness of different task structures on differences in learning strategy.",>Micah Goldwater>Hilary Don>Evan Livesey,">University of Sydney, NSW Australia>University of Sydney, NSW Australia>University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0543/index.html
2016,The effect of loss and gain expression in the riddle on insight problem solving,"Previous studies suggested that heuristics sometimes obstructed solving particular insight problems (e.g. Knoblich, 1999). Abe & Nakagawa (2008) took up the Cheater Detection Model (CDM: Cosmides, 1989) as an adaptive heuristic within social environment, and suggested that it has a negative influence on the ‘missing dollar’ riddle. In this study, we examined the same type of insight problem from a different point of view, i.e., the balance of loss and gain. We made two isomorphic riddles: in one riddle some amount of money was lost and was never found (the loss condition), and in another riddle the same amount of money was spent for additional service (the benefit condition). The percentage of correct answer was significantly higher for the latter. The result suggested that the balance of loss and gain influenced the cognitive set of the participants. The occurrence of loss might draw their attention on outflow of the money.",>Reiko Yakushijin>Katsutochi Endo,">AOYAMA GAKUIN UNIVERSITY, TOKYO, JAPAN>AOYAMA GAKUIN UNIVERSITY, TOKYO, JAPAN",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0544/index.html
2016,Beyond the 64 Squares: Does Chess Instruction Enhance Children’s Academic and Cognitive Skills? A Meta-Analysis,"In recent years, pupils’ poor achievement in mathematics has been a concern in many Western countries. Chess instruction has been proposed as one way to remedy this state of affairs, as well as improving other academic topics and general cognitive abilities. The aim of this paper is to quantitatively evaluate the available empirical evidence that skills acquired during chess instruction in schools positively transfer to mathematics, reading, and general cognitive skills. The selection criteria were met by 24 studies (40 effect sizes), with a total of 5,221 participants. The results show (a) a moderate overall effect size (g = 0.34), and (b) a significant positive effect of duration of treatment (p < .05). However, almost no study controlled for placebo effects by using an active control group. For this reason, there are still doubts about the real effectiveness of chess instruction – in spite of some promising results.",>Giovanni Sala>Fernand Gobet,">University of Liverpool, UK>University of Liverpool, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0545/index.html
2016,Memory biases in matching and recall: Evidence from initial consonant clusters,"Perception and memory of linguistic information is biased in favor of stimuli that conform to structural regularities. At the level of word form, there is evidence that initial consonant clusters varying in grammatical status (e.g., br vs. *bn, *bd, *rb) differentially affect response times in same-different matching (e.g., slower responses to rbif - REBIF than to brif - BERIF; Berent & Lennertz, 2010). Previous results are consistent with two hypotheses: non-conforming clusters could be modified by a specific 'repair' (e.g., rbif recoded as rebif), or the encoding of such clusters could be more uncertain and their recall more variable. A series of matching and full-recall experiments support the second hypothesis: the response time effect for non-conforming clusters is observed for both *rbif - REBIF and *rbif - RBIFE, but only the former 'repairs' the cluster; furthermore, errors made in recall exhibit high variability and do not systematically improve structural well-formedness.",>Mackenzie Young>Colin Wilson,>Johns Hopkins University>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0546/index.html
2016,Assessing Science Inquiry using MDP Goal Detectors,"Complex cognitive tasks, such as science inquiry, often involve a sequence of goals, each of which is pursued through a sequence of actions. Effective assessment of inquiry performance requires identification of these student goals. Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been used to infer goals and beliefs over a single directed sequence of actions (Baker et al., 2009), but multi-goal complex systems are computationally prohibitive to model. This research investigates the use of targeted MDPs as goal detectors, embedded within a larger hidden Markov model (HMM) that accounts for the transition between goals. This multi-layer approach allows the MDP state spaces to remain small while modeling complex cognition. Because canonical HMM estimation is complicated by the dynamic nature of MDPs, in which action probabilities depend on context, we explore several different estimation methods. The approach is applied to log-file data of test-taker interactions with a simulation-based science inquiry assessment.",>Michelle Lamar>Janet Koster van Groos,>Educational Testing Service>Educational Testing Service,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0547/index.html
2016,Metaphor and Memory: How Metaphors Instantiate Schemas in and Influence Memory of Narrative,"Metaphoric frames are prominently featured in public discourse. They highlight certain aspects of the target issues they are used to describe, thereby encouraging specific patterns of inference. Our goal was to test whether they would influence memory as well. Building off prior work, we contrasted two metaphors for crime: virus and beast. In a pilot study, we identified specific causes, examples, and solutions to crime that were congruent with each frame (one but not the other; e.g., people thought “drug use” better exemplified a crime virus, whereas “murder” better exemplified a crime beast). Participants (n = 469) read or listened to a short metaphorically-framed crime report, completed a filler task, and were prompted for the information they had seen/heard. Results indicated the virus metaphor facilitated memory, overall, but not the specific frame-congruent information, suggesting a more general influence of the frame than predicted.",>Sarah Cox>Paul Thibodeau,>Oberlin College>Oberlin College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0548/index.html
2016,Is human learning driven by Prediction Error?,"Prediction Error [PE] is a core component of some of the most influential theories of how animals use experiences to update their knowledge (e.g, Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). The classic demonstration of PE is the single-cell recording done by Schultz and colleagues (1997). However, there is no evidence that this signal plays any role in learning. Only two studies have related a neural correlate of PE to learning performance so far (Gläscher, Daw, Dayan, & O’Doherty, 2010; McGuire, Nassar, Gold, & Kable, 2014). We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that non-PE learning can also explain the results of these studies if the imaging signal they identify relates to the size of weight updates instead of PE. We conclude that the case for PE driving many forms of animal learning is not yet sufficiently proven, and identify approaches which can potentially resolve this question in future.",>Jiří Čevora>Máté Lengyel>Richard Henson,">Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Medical Research Council>Computational and Biological Learning Lab, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge>Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Medical Research Council",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0549/index.html
2016,Modeling the Influence of Knowledge on Recognition: Connecting visual recognition behavior across development to PDP computational models of semantic knowledge,"Recent behavioral findings in children’s selection of a “real” versus “silly” animal demonstrated a developmental change wherein younger children select chimeric animals with regular forms (e.g., a seal with four legs, a camel with no hump) as real. To reduce verbal demands while maintaining the same stimuli, we developed a touch screen change-detection task in which children (4 – 7-years-old) were instructed to locate a single changing feature (e.g., a rhinoceros with and without a horn) as fast as possible. Children were faster to find changes when the feature appeared on animals with more prototypic animal forms (e.g., a donkey with and without a hump) when compared to animals with atypical forms (e.g., a camel with and without a hump). Alongside exploration via computational models, these findings suggest that children’s real-world object recognition is supported by the interplay of semantic knowledge, informed by covariation among visual features, and visual recognition.",>Clint Jensen>Vanessa Simmering>Timothy Rogers,>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0550/index.html
2016,Explanation-based discourse inferences support early word learning,"Children can learn new words from non-instructive contexts (e.g., overheard speech). Recently, it has been proposed that one way that children do this is by using the surrounding discourse to constrain the interpretation of new words (Sullivan & Barner, 2015). However, little is known about what sort of discourse inferences children might compute when learning. In the present study, we adopt a discourse-coherence framework (e.g., Rohde et al., 2006) in order to explain how preschoolers (N = 96, M = 49.2 months, range: 28-65 months) learn new words from discourse. We ask whether young children compute adult-like discourse coherence relations across clauses, and provide some of the earliest evidence that they do. We then relate children’s ability to compute these discourse coherence relations to their ability to learn a novel word from that discourse, demonstrating the relation between the computation of discourse coherence and early word learning.",>Jessica Sullivan>Juliana Boucher>Rachel Goodkind>Reina Kiefer>Raymond Skyer>Katie Williams,>Skidmore College>Skidmore College>Skidmore College>Skidmore College>Skidmore College>Skidmore College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0551/index.html
2016,Moral language in the Basel Accords: A quantitative analysis,"Technical documents are generally perceived as objective and free of opinion. The Basel Accords, a global financial regulatory standard, fall into this category. Therefore, political texts have to appear as morally neutral. In this paper we argue that some moral arguments and convictions can be found in most texts, including technical ones. To test this hypothesis, we employ a novel quantitative analysis, based on corpus statistics and uncover elements of moral language that are present in the Basel Accords. In particular, we investigate the differences between the language used in different parts of the Accords and how it evolved over time. Our results show an increase in moral language that emphasizes fairness following the financial crisis of 2007-2009. In contrast, moral language relating to authority greatly decreased in the most recent version of the Accords.",>Eyal Sagi>Hadar Jabotinsky,">University of St. Francis, Joliet, IL>Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0552/index.html
2016,Measuring Cognitive Skills through Conversation-Based Assessment,"Conversation-Based Assessment (CBA) represents a relatively new method of measuring student cognitive skills (e.g., science reasoning) through adaptive dialogues with automated characters. This approach leverages the openness of natural language with the interactivity of spoken dialogue to engage students in verbal reasoning and constructive processes (i.e., cognition). These two dimensions differentiate CBA from other assessment items (e.g., multiple choice and essays) by allowing for more freedom in responses along with the ability to adapt and follow-up on particular threads of information. The conversational exchange affords a rich data stream that can provide additional explanatory evidence of students’ cognition exhibited through conversational content and dialogue paths. The current work, built on the AutoTutor dialogue engine, will discuss the affordances and constraints of CBA along with how this approach may complement and enhance other methods of measuring of cognitive skills.",>G.

2016,Single-kernel models of single-voxel visual selectivities in convolution neural networks,"The translation of retinal images into recognizable objects and scenes is not yet well understood. Beyond edge-detection in primary visual cortex, higher stages of cortical representation are still uncertain. We use a multi-layer convolutional neural network (Krizhevsky, 2012) to provide models for visual selectivities in the ventral visual pathway. We examine individual neural units, or ""kernels"", in CNN layer 2, correlating kernel activity to single fMRI voxel activity for 1750 natural images (Kay, 2008). Building on Güçlü (2015), we find most significant voxel-kernel correlations in V2, with additional matches throughout the ventral pathway. Notably, only 25% of kernels correlate with voxel responses --- many voxels correlate with a consistent small set of kernels. Inhibition of voxel response for kernel selectivities also was observed. Our results indicate a limited number of CNN kernels may be used to gain a finer understanding of voxel level representations in the mid-level ventral visual pathway.",>Daniel Leeds>Ivan Iotzov,">Fordham University, Bronx, New York, United States>Fordham University, Bronx, New York, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0554/index.html

A matter of ongoing debate in multisensory research is whether attentional resources are shared or distinct across sensory modalities. Previous research suggested that the type of tasks that humans perform in separate sensory modalities determines whether attentional resources are shared or distinct across sensory modalities. Here, we investigated the relation between attentional resources and the performed type of tasks in four experiments using a dual task paradigm. We found shared attentional resources for vision, haptics and audition when two purely spatial tasks were performed in separate sensory modalities (Experiment 1 & 2) while we found distinct attentional resources for the same sensory modalities when a spatial task was performed together with a discrimination task (Experiment 3 & 4). Overall, our findings suggest that the distribution of attentional resources is operating at a task-level independent of the involved sensory modalities.",>Basil Wahn>Peter König,">University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, Germany>University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0555/index.html

Timed calculation was operationalized as single-digit addition fluency and untimed calculation was operationalized as performance on the Woodcock Calculation subtest and KeyMath Numeration subtest. Examined concurrently, separate multiple regressions revealed that phonological awareness predicted timed calculation and all three cognitive measures predicted untimed calculation performance. Examined longitudinally, separate multiple regressions revealed that phonological awareness again predicted timed calculation and that phonological awareness and visuo-spatial short-term memory predicted untimed calculation performance. These results suggest a difference in the predictive set between timed and untimed calculation tests; furthermore, a difference between concurrent and longitudinal predictors.",>Olivia Wassing>Marcie Penner-Wilger,">King's University College at Western University , London , Ontario, Canada>King's University College at Western University, London, ON, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0556/index.html
2016,"On the Evaluability of Effort: Influences of Single and Joint Evaluation on Judgments of Subjective Effort in Memorial, Motor, and Perceptual Domains","Theories attempting to explain the evaluation of subjective values often stress the importance of the context in which a judgment is made. One such theory, the General Evaluability Theory (GET; Hsee & Zhang, 2010), suggests judgments are particularly sensitive to evaluation mode (i.e., a single or joint evaluation). Importantly, deviations in the patterns of judgments of a value across single and joint modes are argued to reflect the degree to which individuals can consistently evaluate that value (i.e., the extent of evaluability). We applied this framework to a novel context, specifically the evaluation of effort. Individuals made judgments of effort across memorial, motor, and perceptual domains in single and joint evaluation modes. Results demonstrated that memorial and motor effort judgments remained largely consistent across modes, whereas perceptual effort judgments did not. These results provide initial evidence that at least some types of effort may not be evaluable.",>Timothy Dunn>Evan Risko,">University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0557/index.html
2016,Towards a Pre-Newtonian Intuitive Physics of Object Collisions,"Some researchers have argued that mass perception, causal ascriptions, and predictions in simple billiard ball interactions can be modeled as inductive Bayesian inference over a (noisy) Newtonian representation of the world. However, there are phenomena, such as the asymmetrical ascription of forces to colliding objects, that are conceptually incompatible with the symmetry of Newtonian physics. We propose that human inference in physical scenarios operates over a pre-Newtonian physical representation that is based on impetus intuitions. Impetus theories assume that object movements are caused by an internal force, impetus, that is transferred and reflected when objects collide with each other. Moreover, impetus interactions are inherently asymmetric. We present a mathematical model that implements impetus theory and show that the theory is well suited to model perceived causal asymmetry. Moreover, the theory can also explain phenomena that so far have been presented as unique evidence for (noisy) Newtonian representations.",>Ralf Mayrhofer>Michael Waldmann,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0558/index.html
2016,Parsing Selective Attention and Executive Function in Children,"Selective attention is related to a range of cognitive abilities, including executive function (Lawson et al., 2014). Orienting attention to visual and auditory targets are component skills inherent in many cognitive assessments, making it often difficult to parse cognitive capacities from selective attention abilities.The fundamental, early-developing nature of somatosensory processing (Saby et al., 2015) make it a compelling sensory domain within which to study top-down attentional processes. This presentation describes the initial results of a study examining how the electrophysiological indicators of selective attention, specifically the ability to focus attention on tactile stimuli, relate to children’s executive function. Results will parse the relations between a composite of executive function tasks and the EEG mu rhythm response of participants when anticipating tactile stimulation of the hand.

However, little is known about what cognitive mechanisms support this benefit. Here, we investigate whether sustained attention, as measured by reports of mind wandering (i.e., lapses in attention) during reading, mediates the relationship between disfluency and text comprehension. We manipulated the typeface (fluent: Arial; disfluent: Comic Sans) of two texts on research methods. A total of 208 participants recruited online read either one of these texts, either in a fluent or disfluent typeface, followed by a series of text level and inference level comprehension questions. We found that mind wandering was less frequent when participants read disfluent text. Importantly, our results show that the relationship between disfluency and text level comprehension was indirectly mediated by mind wandering, suggesting that sustained attention is one of the cognitive mechanisms by which disfluency influences comprehension.",>Myrthe Faber>Caitlin Mills>Kristopher Kopp>Sidney D'mello,">University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States>University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States>University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States>University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0560/index.html

These violations have led researchers to conclude that the rules of probability are too complex for most people to use, and that cognitively-easier approximations such as averaging are used instead. Unlike previous work that has assumed that individuals use only a single combination rule, we collected repeated estimates of conjunctions and disjunctions and investigated whether individuals consistently used a single rule or used a repertoire of rules in a trial-by-trial Bayesian analysis. When not incentivized, most participants were best described as randomly selecting a combination rule on each trial, and the correct rule was the most often used. Despite this, when incentivized to use their single-best strategy participants were more likely to use the incorrect averaging rule.

2016,The presence of meaning constrains productive language processes: A test of the language game hypothesis in type writing.,"How does meaning influence cognitive processes involved in the production and reception of language? The language-game hypothesis (LGH) states that meaning acts to constrain the cognitive processes involved in language comprehension. The degree of constraint can be gauged by measures of structuredness of a process, e.g. using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). LGH was originally formulated in the area of reading. The present study investigate its generalization to productive language processes, i.e. writing. In this study participants copy-typed a comprehensible text, written in their native language, and an incomprehensible text, written in an unfamiliar language. The writing process was recorded via key-logging and the time-series of inter-stroke-intervals was subjected to RQA. Results showed that comprehensible texts significantly increased the degree of structuredness of the writing process compared to incomprehensible texts. This suggests that meaning does indeed constrain language processes, and that this is the case for receptive and productive language tasks.",>Sebastian Wallot>Joachim Grabowski,>Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics>University of Hannover,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0562/index.html

Determining whether vitamin C prevents colds may entail knowing the frequency with which colds occur without vitamin C, other cold inhibitors, and the frequency of vitamin C use. Do reasoners integrate all this information to create coherent beliefs? In contrast to models emphasizing modular causal learning (e.g., Cheng, 1997), McDonnell, Tsividis, & Rehder (2013) proposed an integrated model, positing that individuals simultaneously update their beliefs about all components of a causal network. We tested modular versus integrated learning in two experiments using a retrospective inhibition design. In both, participants learned about two causes of headaches sequentially across two phases. We manipulated the base rate of headaches in phase II to be either consistent or inconsistent with phase I learning. Across experiments, participants failed to use base rate information as predicted by the integrated model, supporting modular causal modular learning.",>Bob Rehder>Kelly Goedert>Ciara Willett>Raymond Blattner,>New York University>Seton Hall University>Seton Hall University>Seton Hall University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0563/index.html
2016,A normative theory of visual working memory limitations,"There are many benefits to having a highly accurate representation of the environment. Why, then, has evolution equipped us with a visual working memory (VWM) system that can represent only a handful of items with high accuracy? Here, we offer a normative explanation for this limitation by conceptualizing VWM as a system that balances between two conflicting goals: keeping memory errors small and spiking activity low. We formalize this trade-off in a loss function and show that minimization of loss dictates a strategy in which memory precision declines with the number of remembered items. Using psychophysical data from 67 human subjects in 5 delayed-estimation experiments, we show that this normative model provides an excellent account of human VWM limitations. These results suggest that human VWM implements an optimal compromise between two conflicting ecological goals.",>Ronald van den Berg>Wei Ji Ma,>University of Uppsala>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0564/index.html

In this study, I proposed that the explanandum’s thematic relation, which is mostly determined by the predicate, i.e., action verb or state verb, is crucial for the explanation type preference (thematic relation theory). To compare the two theories, participants were asked to read a sentence describing the explanandum, and then judge the appropriateness of two explanations for the explanandum, mechanistic and teleological, one after the other. Order of the two explanations were counterbalanced over participants. The domain and thematic relations were manipulated by varying the subject and the predicate of the explanandum.

2016,"Network Analysis of Characters' Relationship in ""Chronicle of Death foretold"" using Graph Theory","Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of interest in network analysis research across the social sciences and computer science. As it is an idea that can be applied in many fields, this study, in particular, its influence in the literature. We present a method for extracting social networks from literature. This study focuses on the relation between novel itself, narration in fiction and was carried out experiments with 89 undergraduate students. They were instructed to write down their remembered memory of the novel after reading the novel ‘Chronicle of a death foretold.’ We extract features from the social networks of characters in students’ recall story and examine their differentiation with one another, as well as novel’s setting. This study compares graph theory–based cohesion measures characters’ relationship in novel and students’ story. Our results suggest an alternative explanation for difference in social networks.",>Jongin Kim>Yohan Moon>Hwiyeol Jo>Jeong Ryu,>Seoul National University>Sung Kyun Kwan University>Seoul National University>Yonsei University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0566/index.html
2016,The construction of function representations,"Whether learning how pressing on the gas pedal of rental car will affect its acceleration or learning how changing the volume of speakers affects the perceived loudness of the sound they produce, humans can quickly learn functions from a few examples. Recent hybrid models (Lucas et al., 2015) combine the structure of rule-based models with the flexibility of similarity-based models by exploiting the equivalence of Bayesian linear regression and Gaussian processes. We expand on these models by taking advantage of the compositional nature of Gaussian processes and imposing a generative grammar over a set of base components in order to build the structured but diverse hypothesis spaces that appear to be represented by people. Subsequent testing will compare this model’s ability to reproduce people’s learning difficulty rankings of different functions, extrapolation results, and representations of multiple overlapping functions to that of other hybrid models.",>Brian Montambault>Christopher Lucas>Joseph Austerweil,">Brown University, Providence, RI, USA>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK>Brown University, Providence, RI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0567/index.html

However, systematic investigation of the development of visual and manual object exploration and potential cascading effects on early word learning is lacking. In a longitudinal study of infants aged 9 to 24 months, we captured dynamic visual and manual information using head-mounted eye tracking and motion tracking of infants’ hands as infants and their parents played with objects. Parents completed the MCDI vocabulary assessment at every visit. We will present preliminary data investigating individual and developmental differences in visual and manual object exploration, the resulting object views that are generated, and their relation to word learning. The results will inform our understanding of the relations between motor development, visual attention, and word learning in infancy.",>Lauren Slone>Chen Yu>Linda Smith,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0568/index.html
2016,Measuring individual and developmental differences in children's sense of confidence,"From something as simple as judging the time to more complicated behaviours like answering trivia questions, our cognitive systems always provide us with a representation of confidence: the probability of being correct. The development of confidence has been a long-standing issue in cognitive and developmental science. However, most studies assess children’s confidence through either extensively trained numerical or verbal scales (“I am sure”), or by asking children to gamble on their answer. These measures stand to confuse metacognition with the development of language and inhibitory control. Here, we validate a novel model and task that measures individual and developmental differences in confidence relatively (“Are you more confident in X or Y”). Subsequently, we apply this task to demonstrate that metacognitive abilities of children aged 5–8 show significant development in the domain of intuitive number representations. These results are discussed in a broader context of theory and measurement of metacognition.",>Carolyn Baer>Darko Odic,">University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada>University of British Columbia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0569/index.html

This assessment was based on Hannon & Daneman's (2001) paradigm and Hannon & Frias' (2012) component processes tasks, including the memory measure, the inference measure, knowledge access and integration measure, and modified to two parts in order to assess 4th to 6th graders' reading comprehension processes. We reduced the difficulties and complexity of this comprehension measure for younger children. Four-hundred-and-fifty participants (at 4th to 6th grade level) were recruited from four elementary schools in Chia-Yi, Taiwan. The results show that the Cronbach's alpha coefficients were .75 to .87 and the citerion-reference validity was around .70 to .75 with the Chinese Reading Comprehension Test.

In two experimental studies we explored the potential of artificial tutors to avoid inhibition effects and exploit linguistic alignment processes in HCI for SLA. Study 1 (n=130 non-native speakers) investigated the influence of system voice (text-to-speech vs. pre-recorded speech) and embodiment (virtual agent vs. robot vs. speech based interaction) on participants’ perception of the system, their motivation, their lexical and syntactical alignment during interaction and their learning effect after the interaction, while in Study 2 (n=85) embodiment and the presence of expressive nonverbal behavior were varied. The variation of system characteristics had barely influence on the evaluation of the system or participants’ alignment behavior.

In speech, for instance, phonemes can group to form syllables, which group to form words, which group to form sentences, and so on. In music, notes can group to form phrases, which group to form chord progressions, which group to form verses, and so on. We present a new method for extracting events (amplitude peaks in Hilbert envelopes of filter banks) from speech and music recordings, and quantifying the degree of nesting in temporal clusters of events across timescales (using Allan Factor analysis). We apply this method to monologue recordings of speech (TED talks) and also to solo musical performances of similar lengths. We found that both types of recordings exhibit nested clustering, revealing similar organizational principles, but that clustering is more pronounced on shorter timescales (milliseconds) for speech, but longer timescales (seconds+) for music.",>Butovens Médé>Ramesh Balasubramaniam>Chris Kello,">University of California Merced, Merced, California, United States>University of California Merced, Merced, California, United States>University of California Merced, Merced, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0572/index.html
2016,Developmental deficit in autobiographical episodic memory: Evidence from Williams syndrome,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic developmental disorder characterized by severe spatial impairments and structural and functional abnormalities in the hippocampus (Meyer-Lindenburg et al., 2006). Although the spatial deficit is well-documented, we know little about other deficits that would be predicted by the hippocampal abnormalities. Here, we examine episodic memory (i.e. memory for personally experienced events in a spatio-temporal context, Tulving, 1983), asking people with WS to recount past personal events. We use an interview method developed for patients (Levine et al., 2002) and typically developing children (Willoughby et al., 2012). People with WS recounted significantly fewer episodic details than age-matched controls. Importantly however, they offered just as many semantic details (reflecting general world knowledge), indicating that global factors (e.g., verbal skill or IQ) cannot account for these results. Our work identifies a specific cognitive deficit in WS and further highlights the critical involvement of the hippocampus in episodic memory.",>Katrina Ferrara>Alexandra Cohen>Barbara Landau,>Georgetown University>Johns Hopkins University>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0573/index.html
2016,Building bilingual semantic representations based on a corpus-based statistical learning algorithm,"In the current study, we applied a corpus-based statistical learning algorithm to derive semantic representations of words under bilingual situations (English and Chinese). The algorithm relies on the analyses of contextual information extracted from a text corpus, specifically, analyses of word co-occurrences in a large-scale electronic database of text. Particularly, we examined how the semantic structure of L2 words can be built based on and influenced by the semantic representations of L1 words in a sequential L2 learning situation. We got the semantic representations under various conditions and the results were processed and illustrated on self-organizing maps, an unsupervised neural network model that projects the statistical structure of the context onto a 2-D space. We further discussed a couple of factors that affected the validity of the representations.",>Xiaowei Zhao,>Emmanuel College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0574/index.html

However, a systematic analysis of how much each purported dimension predicts the overall Aha! experience is needed. Presented with a large set of difficult problems (magic tricks), participants were asked to rate their solving experience with regard to suddenness in the emergence of the solution, certainty about the solution, surprise, pleasantness, relief, and drive. The strongest correlations with an overall Aha! rating on correct solutions were found for the dimensions of pleasantness, relief and certainty. Suddenness and drive were correlated to a lesser extent. No significant correlation was found for surprise. These results question the wisdom of the established approach of using a multi-component operational definition for the Aha! experience that encompasses suddenness, certainty and surprise. The positive affect that comes with discovery seems better expressed as pleasantness or relief than surprise.",>Amory H.

2016,On Constancy in Spatial Perception,"The perceptual constancies are at the heart of the scientific and philosophical study of perceptual experience, for they are responsible for our enjoying stable percepts despite fluctuating proximal stimulation. For some time, it has therefore seemed natural to appeal to the constancies as a way of explaining the factivity of perception - how (in veridical cases) we present or represent our environments as they are. Notably, a number of theorists now reject the suggestion that color constancy straightforwardly allows us to track mind-independent physical properties, such as surface spectral reflectances. In the spatial literatures, however, the constancies remain tasked with accounting for the perceptual presentation or representation of objective values as they are independent of perceivers. In this presentation, I outline the unacceptable normative consequences of these latter views, and sketch an alternative, more ecologically plausible understanding of veridicality in spatial perception.",>Louise Daoust,">University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0576/index.html

The present line of research includes studies demonstrating that metacomprehension accuracy may be especially poor when students are presented with texts that include features such as diagrams, graphs, animations, and analogical examples. Although these adjuncts are meant to improve comprehension, they can often lead to illusions of understanding. An important theme of this research is articulating the kinds of instruction and skills that students may need before they can learn effectively from expository science texts including graphics or analogies.",>Jennifer Wiley>Thomas Griffin>Allison Jaeger>David Sarmento>Marta Mielicki,>UIC>UIC>Temple University>UIC>UIC,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0577/index.html
2016,Auditory N1 Amplitude Varies Across Multiple Acoustic and Phonological Dimensions in Speech,"Listeners are sensitive to numerous fine-grained acoustic cues in speech. However, there has been little work examining how listeners encode these cues at early stages of perception. The event-related potential (ERP) technique provides a tool to help us address this. Previous work shows that the amplitude of the auditory N1 ERP component varies with differences along VOT continua, but it is not clear which other cues show similar effects. We present data examining a large set of minimal pair stimuli spanning 18 consonants. Results reveal widespread differences in N1 amplitude for stops, fricatives, and nasals, including distinctions primarily caused by temporal cues (stop voicing; /b,d,g/ vs. /p,t,k/) and spectral cues (place of articulation; /b,p/ vs. /d,t/ vs. /g,k/). Our results suggest that early speech processing is based on fine-grained acoustic cues, rather than articulatory differences, and that the ERP technique provides a useful tool for measuring speech sound encoding.",>Olivia Pereira>Joe Toscano,">Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, United States>Villanova University, Villanova, PA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0578/index.html
2016,Does Contrast or Comparison Help More? The Role of Learning Mode and Category Type,"Recent work suggests that classification training and observational learning may differ with regard to the benefits of different types of item presentation. In particular, there is evidence that between-category contrast is most helpful for traditional classification learning of feature-based categories, while a supervised observational mode promotes learning of relational categories via within-category comparison. The purpose of this study is to begin to tease apart the role of the learning mode versus the type of category in producing this pattern of results by replicating an earlier study that used classification training and feature-based categories, and adding in observational learning conditions. If under these conditions, contrast is beneficial for both learning modes, it will suggest that the type of category being learned is the key to the previously observed difference. If, on the other hand, that same difference is observed, it will suggest that the cause is the learning mode itself.",>Jan Andrews>Ken Livingston>Calais Larson>Ken Kurtz,>Vassar College>Vassar College>Vassar College>Binghamton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0579/index.html
2016,Speech Perception Across the Lifespan: Using a Gaussian Mixture Model to Understand Changes in Cue Weighting Between Younger and Older Adults,"In order to understand speech, listeners must weight and combine multiple acoustic cues. For example, voice onset time (VOT) is a reliable cue to stop consonant voicing, while onset F0 provides information, but is much less reliable. Consequently, we would expect listeners to weight VOT higher than F0. This is the pattern observed for most listeners. However, these cue weights also change over time, and older adults tend to rely less on VOT than young adults, even in listeners without hearing loss. One hypothesized mechanism for this change is a decreased ability to detect temporal differences in sounds, which renders temporal cues (e.g., VOT) less reliable and leads to a greater reliance on spectral information (F0). We simulate this using a weighted Gaussian mixture model and find evidence in support of this mechanism: decreased temporal cue reliability leads to the same pattern of differences observed between younger and older listeners.",>Sarah Vrabic>Elke Nordeen>Joe Toscano,">Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, United States>Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, United States>Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0580/index.html

In the first session, participants completed measures of working memory and adaptivity. Participants then performed 4.5 hours of a multitasking activity that involved prioritizing, selecting, and sorting objects into bins under time pressure. The analyses reported here focus on how participants prioritized objects in a queue of objects and selected objects from that queue for sorting. Priority selection strategies were automatically extracted using machine learning methods. Differences in strategy use were related to measures of working memory and adaptivity. Strategy use and strategy change mediated the relationship between task performance and individual differences. A hierarchical clustering analysis revealed patterns of strategy shifts that distinguished between participants who improved and those who did not.

From narrative monologues (Dale, 2014) to dyadic task performance (Paxton, Abney, Kello, & Dale, 2014), recent efforts have sought to identify multimodal signatures of different types of communication. We extend these efforts in the current project by investigating the multimodal signatures of learning about a pressing but publicly controversial issue: global warming. Here, we explore how personal political stances and previous scientific understanding affect patterns of multimodal behavior (i.e., language use and gaze patterns) when participants are asked to learn about and then describe the mechanisms behind global warming (Ranney et al., 2013). Quantifying understanding -- and exploring how personal traits affect that understanding -- is not only vital to better describing communication dynamics overall but may also shed light on emerging efforts to educate the public on important scientific concerns.",>Alexandra Paxton>Drew Abney>Kristina Castellanos>Gilbert Sepulveda,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0582/index.html

Two EEG experiments were conducted to investigate the difficulty associated with imagining activities from different visual perspectives. Experiment 1 involved participants imagining ongoing activities (e.g., I was skating) from a first and third person perspective. Experiment 2 involved completed activities (I skated) and also included a condition in which participants imagined other people from a third person perspective (Karen skated). Slow cortical brain potentials revealed that the third-person perspective was generally the most difficult to imagine and that the third-person-self perspective was more difficult than the third-person-other perspective. Imagining activities as ongoing or completed did not influence the pattern of results.

We conducted a replication and extension to investigate whether the same pattern holds when deciding whether to extend a relational category label from a base example to a target. Participants were assigned to judge either category extension or analogical soundness (using a more direct version of the original measure) across four targets that shared HOR structure, surface similarity, neither, or both (literal similarity) with the base passage. We found that shared HOR structure led to a higher likelihood of both extending the category label and judging the analogy to be good. No effect of surface similarity was found. These results suggest that the generalization of relational categories follows the same principles of structure-mapping theory that are seen in analogical processing.",>Sean Snoddy>Kenneth J.

Theories emphasising high-level memory structures or holistic processing of stimuli predict no difference between experts and novices at recalling unstructured material, because no large structure or whole are present in such material. Conversely, theories assuming small memory structures (e.g., chunks) predict a skill effect, because even in scrambled material some small meaningful structures occur by chance. This meta-analysis assessed the correlation between expertise and recall of unstructured material in several domains, including board games, programming, sports, and music. We found a moderate but significant overall correlation (r = .42, p < .001), and the presence of an effect in nearly every domain. This outcome suggests that experts base their superiority on a vaster knowledge of small memory structures, in addition to high-level structures or holistic processing.",>Giovanni Sala>Fernand Gobet,">University of Liverpool, UK>University of Liverpool, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0585/index.html

However, investigations of this relationship with school-aged children have shown mixed results, making it unclear whether mental-state talk continues to play a role in false-belief understanding following the preschool years (e.g. Charman & Shmueli-Goetz, 1998; Grazzini & Ornaghi, 2012). This discrepancy may result from the fact that preschooler’s talk has consistently been assessed during interpersonal interactions with peers, siblings, and parents, while school-aged children’s talk has been assessed via descriptions of wordless picture books or absent friends. The present study bridges this gap by exploring whether adults’ use of mental-state language during interaction correlates with their false-belief performance.

He made evident that, under uncertainty, particular cues in an interaction between an agent and a patient (e.g., two entities, agent focuses on patient, contact, effect in patient) guide people's perception of causality. This study systematically examines the predictive strength of eight causal cues worked out by White (2013) and aims at comparing people's reliance on these cues in the physical and the biological domain. Children (7-year-old) and adults judged a prototype (mechanical collision event or stinging event) and another nine prototype related events, with systematically omitted cues. A general linear mixed models analysis revealed a significant effect for the number of cues in an event. Both age groups rely on singular causal cues when interpreting physical and biological events.

Participants were presented with objects and words in ambiguous learning trials. In some learning trials, participants saw multiple objects and heard their individual labels presented in a random order, while in other trials, category labels were presented instead. Results from three experiments provided converging evidence that adults were able to use word-object co-occurrences across different situations to learn hierarchical labels. Moreover, participants generalized category labels to novel members at the same level but not to superordinate-level instances.

Bayesian logic formalizes a rational intensional probability, predicting IFs and supplementing standard extensional probabilities (von Sydow, 2011, 2016). They treat logical patterns as explanatory patterns (explanans) given some data (the explanandum). We here address the even more basic issue of nested hypotheses in a single polytomous dimension (von Sydow, 2015) and present a corresponding variant of Bayesian logic (BL). The experiments use materials from the Linda tasks (one concerned with jobs, the other with political attitude) and they explore the polysemous character of ‘AND’ (Hertwig, Benz & Krauss, 2008; von Sydow, 2014). BL stresses that pattern probabilities should depend on the representation of subclasses.

2016,Motor cortex excitability during processing of handwritten and typed non-action-related text,"Motor cortex has been found to play a crucial role in processing the semantics of spoken and written action-related language as well as in early speech perception. One possibility is that the motor system is always involved in perception and cognition, picking up any available motor information in the environment. If this is true we should see increased corticospinal excitability when subjects are looking at anything that affords motor behaviors or possible simulation of motor behaviors. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and electromyography to investigate corticospinal excitability while participants read handwritten or typed words and non-words from a computer screen. Results show that for typed words, there is an increase in excitability for words compared to non-words, while the reverse is true for handwritten words.

2016,In the nick of time: Using temporal cues to examine ongoing event representations,"Time cues are ubiquitous in language and the ability to interpret them is essential for understanding events during discourse comprehension. Temporal markers that signal ongoing versus completed events, like the progressive and simple past tense, prompt distinct mental event representations. However, the detailed properties of ongoing event representations remain unexplored. Drawing from both the simulation and semantic association approaches to knowledge representation, this study examines the novel prediction that ongoing events engender incremental discourse representation updating processes. Experimental sentences cued either early or late phases of an ongoing event (e.g. Alice had recently started/almost finished baking a cake). Targets in a post-sentential lexical decision task were strongly associated with either early or late event phases (e.g. EGGS/AROMA). Facilitation priming was predicted for congruent sentence-target pairs. Implications of the results for models of knowledge representation, theories of semantic priming, and discourse model updating will be discussed.",>Victoria Scharp>Connie Tompkins>Michael Dickey,">University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh, PA, United States>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0592/index.html
2016,Toward a Simulation Platform for Comparing Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Models,"While computational cognitive models serve many purposes, perhaps their primary utility is in formalizing specific hypotheses in order to facilitate evaluation in light of empirical results. Such evaluations are inherently relative, comparing the explanatory power of proposed models to alternatives. Direct comparisons are hindered, however, when competing hypotheses are framed within different cognitive architectures, as the contributions of non-focal aspects of those architectures cannot necessarily be yoked. In order to help address this problem, a novel computational framework for model comparison is proposed, grounded in gross neuroanatomy. This framework supports the hierarchical specification of connections between brain systems, producing computational architectures based on neuroscientific data. This approach shifts from modeling particular cognitive processes, which might differ across cognitive architectures, to modeling established brain systems, for which there may be greater consensus. The framework supports the direct comparison of models of a given system by fixing the function of other systems.",>David Noelle,">University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0593/index.html
2016,Consequences of bilingualism for perceptions of categories and similarity,"Speakers of two languages have access to two semantic systems that, while largely similar, may differ in subtle ways. The existence of multiple similar systems offers the potential for comparison of their structures and discovery of the differences between them. We hypothesized that if bilinguals engage in such a comparison process, they may be (a) less likely than monolinguals to view the categories of any single language as natural kinds, and (b) more likely than monolinguals to discern differences among high-similarity items more generally. Monolingual and bilingual participants indicated their level of agreement with statements equating social categories with natural kinds and judged the similarity of pairs of perceptual relations. Compared to monolinguals, bilinguals were less willing to endorse naturalness statements and showed more variability in their similarity judgments. These results suggest that bilingualism may promote sensitivity to differences among highly similar stimuli, linguistic and otherwise.",>Kevin Holmes>Jacob Brodsky,>Colorado College>Colorado College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0594/index.html

In an eye-tracked word-learning experiment, 58 bilinguals and 28 English monolinguals each learned English-like and Mandarin-like wordsets, words referring to images. Wordsets differed primarily in that English-like words contained final consonants. We explained that some words might differ only in their pitch patterns, and included training on minimal tone pairs. In test, two pictures appeared on the screen with referents differing in either tone or vowel. One picture was labeled. Bilinguals processed tones more efficiently (t(78) = 3.54, p = .001) and more accurately (t(84) = 3.78, p < .001) than monolinguals only in the Mandarin context. Mandarin-English bilinguals thus appear to tailor tone processing to the within-word language context.",>Carolyn Quam>Sarah Creel,">University of Arizona>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0595/index.html
2016,Modifying Cognitive Load Component Survey for K-12 STEM Testing,"Test-taker’s capability to answer questions is influenced by available cognitive resources for problem solving. Due to the limited working memory capacity, excessive cognitive load for interpreting instruction would impact test-taker’s construct-relevant process and test validity. Especially in STEM assessment where multimedia and interactive design are widely used, test-takers can easily get overwhelmed by a large amount of visual or audio information. Testing materials should be designed to minimize the unnecessary cognitive load in order to increase cognitive resources for problem solving in the task. The Cognitive Load Component Survey is one of the first self-report measurements distinguishing different types of cognitive load: intrinsic cognitive load, extraneous cognitive load, and germane cognitive load. We report modifications of this survey to fit into K-12 educational assessment, results of measuring cognitive loads in a simulation-rich science assessment, and implications to use this survey for future assessment development.",>Jingyuan Huang>Janet Koster van Groos>Michelle Lamar,">Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ, USA>Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ, USA>Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0596/index.html
2016,"The Development of Intuitions about the Controllability of Thoughts, Emotions, and Behavior","From early in development children show impressive knowledge about mental states such as beliefs and desires. However, less is known about the development of knowledge about more sophisticated aspects of mental activity, including the adult intuition that the mind is an independent agent over which we have some but not total control. This project explored 8- to 11-year-olds’ (n = 46) and adults’ (n = 48) beliefs about the extent to which thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are controllable. Results indicated that both children and adults viewed thoughts and emotions (in contrast to behavior) as relatively involuntary. Children and adults also generally rejected the notion that mental activities and behaviors are chronic. However, while adults were skeptical about whether people can stop their own thoughts, emotions, and behavior, children fully endorsed this type of control. Overall, data suggest that intuitions about the controllability of mental activities continue to mature throughout childhood.",>Brittany Klimek>Amanda Brandone,">Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, United States>Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0597/index.html
2016,A shape-heavy vocabulary does not a shape bias make: A comparison of the content of English-learning children’s and Spanish-learning children’s typical vocabularies,"We asked why Spanish-monolingual children exhibit a weaker, slower-to-develop shape bias in word-learning contexts compared to English-monolingual children (Hahn & Cantrell, 2012). Ten English-monolingual adults and nine English-Spanish bilingual adults rated the perceptual similarity of items indicated by subsets of words from the English MCDI and Spanish MCDI, respectively. Consistent with previous research with similar methodology (Samuelson & Smith, 1999), words for shape-similar items predominated in the content of the English MCDI (47.72%; agreement: 70%, p < .05). Interestingly, words for shape-similar items also predominated in the content of the Spanish MCDI (56.67%; agreement: 70%, p < .05). Results suggest that the types of words that children learn play a less important role in the development of the shape bias than other proposed factors (e.g., syntactical regularities; Smith, 2000). Additional findings and implications for children with various language backgrounds will be discussed.",>Emily Russell>Christina Schonberg>Shawntel Barreiro,">CSUN, Los Angeles, California>University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States>CSUN, Los Angeles, California",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0598/index.html
2016,Motion Capture of Phase Change Transitions During Insight Problem Solving,"Insight problem solving refers to the phenomenon of experiencing a sudden flash of insight when discovering novel problem solving strategies. This sudden transition in thinking suggests a phase change in human cognition as an emergent property of the self-organizing complex system of coupled neural activations. In our study, we developed a method of measuring this phase change within an embodied cognition paradigm. We used 3D motion capture to measure the precise body movements of 21 participants at 120 Hz resolution while they solved 3 different types of insight problems. We analyzed a sliding time series of postural sway and head displacement using recurrence quantification and spectral analyses to determine changes in entropy in the participants’ movements.

Participants rated their level of agreement with scientific statements in four domains (evolution, GMOs, vaccinations, climate change) along with open-ended questions to investigate participants’ reasons for their support or rejection, filled out individual difference measures, and completed a demographics questionnaire asking about frequency of attendance at religious services as a proxy for religiosity, and political ideology along the liberal-conservative spectrum. Lower agreement with scientific statements was found to be related to a lower analytic thinking style and a stronger conservative political ideology. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive and social profiles of individuals who reject scientific conclusions and can be useful in designing future research efforts aimed at investigating science acceptance and science denial.",>Emilio Lobato>Corinne Zimmerman>Steve Croker,>Illinois State University>Illinois State University>Illinois State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0600/index.html
2016,Technological Shaping of Verbal Working Memory: A Difference between Chinese Phonology-Based and Orthography-Based Typing,"Typing Chinese words on a computer can be carried out with a phonology-based or an orthography-based method. Phonological typing constantly engages typists’ verbal working memory (VWM), while orthographic typing engages their visual-spatial working memory (VSWM). Accordingly, habitual phonological typists would develop a better VWM capacity, while habitual orthographic typists would have a better VSWM capacity. Five VWM tests and five VSWM tests were administered to 24 phonological typists and 23 orthographic typists. The results showed that the phonological typists scored higher than the orthographic typists on the VWM tests, but no significant differences on the VSWM scores were observed. The latter result is attributed to the notoriously abundance of homophones in Chinese, which forces the phonological typists to keep attending to the orthographic forms of the characters being typed. Our findings suggest that individual cognitive systems develop and adapt flexibly, subject to shaping by technology within a life’s time.",>Jenn-Yeu Chen>Adam Li,">National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC>National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0601/index.html
2016,Adults’ drawing and recognition of familiar objects and substances: Nonsolids are hard to identify,"In English, categories of solid objects (e.g., couch) are similar in shape, but vary in color and material; categories of nonsolid substances (e.g., yogurt) are similar in material, but vary in color and shape (Samuelson & Smith, 1999). Although even infants can discriminate between how solids and nonsolids should behave (Hespos et al., 2009), increasing evidence suggests recognizing specific substances is difficult for children (Perry et al., 2014). This begs the question, what do adults even know about nonsolids? Twenty adults drew 23 familiar solids and nonsolids. 116 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk attempted to identify each drawing. Participants more accurately identified drawings of solids (M=.70) than nonsolids (M=.25), X2(1)=13.87, p=.0002. Drawings of nonsolids leading to accurate identification often depicted prototypical containers (e.g., milk carton). These results suggest visual recognition—even of nonsolids—is aided by shape and that adults may conceptualize nonsolids as more object-like than was previously thought.",>Lynn Perry,">University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0602/index.html
2016,How Spatial Ability and Stress Impact Escape Path,"Individual differences and situational factors can both affect how and how well one navigates. This study examined the effects of stress and spatial ability, measured as mental rotation ability, on navigation during an emergency situation. Participants learned a virtual mall environment and were subsequently either told to meet a friend at the far exit (control) or to use the far exit to escape a fire. In an emergency, participants made an initial movement faster, made more errors during navigation, and overestimated the amount of time they took to exit relative to controls. Relative to controls, emergency low spatial participants more often reversed a learned path to exit the mall, whereas high spatial participants more often directly used a previously learned path. The results illustrate that stress from an emergency situation negatively impacts navigation, and that the behavioral consequences of this are in part dependent upon one’s spatial abilities.",>Benjamin Nelligan>Alexandra Amorati>Deanne Adams>Christopher Galeucia>Laura Carlson,>University of Notre Dame; Johns Hopkins University>Carnegie Mellon University>Microsoft>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0603/index.html
2016,Rapid emotion discrimination in the infant brain,"The ability to recognize facial expressions of emotion in social partners is important for successful social interactions. It is unknown how accurately and rapidly the infant brain discriminates between emotions with different valences (e.g., happy vs. fearful) and between emotions with similar valences (e.g., fearful vs. angry). The current study uses a novel approach—Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS)—to evaluate emotion discrimination in infancy. FPVS is an electrophysiological technique that relies on rapid presentation of stimuli to create corresponding oscillations in the brain that can be measured at the scalp surface. Preliminary results (n = 6) indicate that infants are indeed sensitive to the visual stimulation: EEG power, averaged over occipital and occipitotemporal areas, was 11.55 times larger at 6Hz compared to surrounding frequencies. This study aims to shed light on a longstanding theoretical debate of whether emotion recognition is innate or learned through experience.",>Alexandra Marquis>Bruno Rossion>Margaret Moulson,>Ryerson University>University of Louvain (UCL)>Ryerson University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0604/index.html
2016,Mental representations and processing of radical expressions,"Mathematical cognition researchers have studied the mental representations of natural numbers, integers, and fractions extensively. We investigated the representations of irrational and perfect square numbers in a laboratory setting. Eighty participants performed (1) a magnitude comparison task (MC) by indicating which of two numbers is greater or lesser, (2) a number line estimation task (NLE) that required subjects to estimate the positions of natural and radical numbers on a number line, and (3) a numeracy test. On the MC task, participants were slower for radical expressions than for natural numbers and showed distance and size effects for both. When comparing radical expressions, they were faster when both numbers were perfect squares. This suggests a privileged mental representation for perfect squares. On the NLE task, participants were less accurate when locating radical expressions. Performance on the numeracy test revealed broad deficits in conceptual and procedural knowledge of irrational numbers.",>Purav Patel>Sashank Varma,>University of Minnesota - Twin Cities>University of Minnesota - Twin Cities,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0605/index.html
2016,"Data Shows Human Behavior is Not Random, period.","Simulations of many people’s decisions are used in public health and safety as well as to support policymaking. These simulations rely on creditable models of individual decision-making. An obvious approach is to develop a list of plausible actions and to then evaluate the benefits of each in the current situation to make the decision. However, such evaluations can be implausible, e.g., zero-intelligence traders in economics, or impracticable because the approach is computationally intensive for large-scale simulations. As a result, a commonly used approach is to select randomly from the plausible actions. Without data on how people would actually chose, a random number from a uniform distribution over the plausible options is often used to represent the unknown cognition. However, we claim that substituting a uniform random distribution for how people make decisions is making very strong claims about the process and we will present data demonstrating it is simply wrong.",>William G.

2016,Feedback Markers in Mandarin: Tracking Cognitive Status in Conversation,"A key aspect of conversation is the interactive exchange of information and the cooperative discourse process that functions to bring about a mutually satisfactory sharing of information. The encountering of new information gives rise to emotional responses as well as on the certainty and degree of cognitive reorientation to the pre-existing knowledge state. In this study we present our results on prosody and contextual meaning of two feedback markers: “dui” and “oh”, showing that the marker “dui” ‘right’, functions to mark the perceived status of lexical truth and degree of understanding, approval, or agreement, thus acting as an indicator of cognitive understanding to organize topic development through signals of a shared knowledge state, whereas the marker “oh” acts as an indicator of temporary cognitive difficulty or reorientation of cognitive states, thus providing the complementary function to “dui” with respect to certainty and uncertainty of information and knowledge states in discourse.",>Li-chiung Yang,">Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0607/index.html

Ex-Gaussian analyses reveal that this effect is seen in the mean of the normal distribution (mu), in the standard deviation of the normal distribution (sigma), and (c) in the tail (tau) of the ex-Gaussian distribution. The present experiments investigate whether the semantically based Stroop effect (which contrasts incongruent color-associated words with neutral controls) is seen in the three ex-Gaussian parameters. This analysis yielded a semantic Stroop effect in the arithmetic mean and mu, but no semantic Stroop effect was observed in tau. These data are consistent with the conclusion that interference associated with response competition on incongruent trials is absent in the semantic Stroop effect (at least in the tail of the distribution).",>Darcy White>Evan Risko>Derek Besner,">University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0608/index.html

Recently sensory, motor and emotional components are also examined to explain the concreteness effect within the embodiment framework. Concreteness effect, which adopts the processing advantages of concrete words over abstract ones, is supported by studies, which show better remembering, faster processing and faster recognizing performances for concrete words. In this study, concreteness effect was examined via two experiments on experts and controls in which verbal fluency and lexical decision tasks were employed. Lawyers were considered as an expert group with their intense deal with abstract concepts. A novice lawyer group and age-matched participants other than lawyers were used as control groups.

2016,A cognitive model of online event segmentation,"People automatically segment online perceptual and conceptual experiences into events (Newston, 1973). A new model-based theory explains how people construct temporal markers and prioritize those changes to build representations of events (Khemlani et al., 2015). The theory is implemented within an embodied extension of the ACT-R cognitive architecture (Anderson, 2007) called ACT-R/E (Trafton et al., 2013). Its principal parameter is the prioritization scheme by which certain detectable changes (e.g., in a perceived location) are preferred over others (e.g., in perceived states of an object). We tested the predictions of the theory and its computational model against an experiment on narrative event segmentation. Participants in the study read an excerpt of text and were asked to assess whether certain lines marked the start of a new event. The computational model readily accounted for their segmentation behavior. We conclude by discussing event segmentation and its relation to embodied cognition and cognitive robotics.",>Anthony Harrison>Sangeet Khemlani>Greg Trafton,>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0610/index.html
2016,Human-object interaction understanding without objects,"During object manipulation the actor’s eye movements are directed to the target of the interaction and to the relevant sites where this takes place. Eye movements during grasping observation are influenced by low-level motor information, helping inferring the target from hand shape. In an eye-tracking experiment, we investigated which factors influence understanding when observing bimanual object interactions, if no objects are visible but only the movements reproduced by an avatar. Participants watched ten different actions (e.g., pour water from a bottle into a cup) and guessed among ten possibilities. Also perspective was varied (frontal, side, head-centered). Preliminary results show higher response accuracy in the frontal perspective. During the interaction phase participants spent more time fixating closer to the interaction point between the hands, where the objects would be, than on the single hands, suggesting this is the best vantage point to make sense of the observed action without other cues.",>Anna Belardinelli>Johannes Lohmann>Martin V.

2016,The Effect of Book Design on Beginning Readers' Attention Allocation,"Books for beginning readers typically intermix text and pictures in close proximity. The proximity of difficult-to-decode text to pictures may induce competition between these sources of information. As a result, children may frequently shift gaze between text and pictures, which may degrade memory representations of the text and reduce comprehension. A mobile eye tracker was used to measure children’s attention allocation while reading commercially available books for beginning readers. Preliminary evidence suggests that pictures capture young children’s (N=12, Mage=7.14 years) attention while they are engaged in guided reading. Even when the text was short (on average 6.94 words per page), children frequently shifted their attention between text and pictures. Per page, children made on average 2.80 alterations from text to pictures (Range: 0.93 to 6.57 alterations). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the close proximity of text and pictures may result in competition between these sources of information.",>Karrie Godwin>Anna Fisher,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0612/index.html
2016,Generating Predictions Non-consciously: Evidence from Invisible Motion with and without Obstacles,"Previous research has established that conscious stimuli can lead to non-conscious predictions. Yet, it also suggests that conscious awareness of stimuli is a necessary condition for using them in predictions. We use subliminal movement – with and without obstacles – to examine predictions from subliminal stimuli. In four experiments, a moving object was masked with continuous flash suppression. After the object had stopped moving, a conscious probe appeared in a location that was either consistent with the movement or not. In the first three experiments the movement was linear, and non-conscious predictions were based on both direction and speed of movement. In Experiment 4, the moving object collided with an obstacle. Response times revealed predictions on the deflection route. We thus conclude that humans can use dynamic subliminal information to generate active predictions about the future",>Ariel Goldstein>Ido Rivlin>Ran Hassin,">Hebrew university, Jerusalem, Israel>Hebrew university, Jerusalem, Israel>Hebrew university, Jerusalem, Israel",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0613/index.html
2016,Using analogical comparison to help children learn the day-night cycle,"Children have difficulty reconciling their observations of the sky (an Earth-based perspective) with scientific models of the solar system (space-based perspectives) (e.g., Vosniadou & Brewer, 1994). Analogical comparison could be an effective way to address this cognitive challenge. By comparing and aligning different perspectives on events, such as sunrise, children may develop a more coherent understanding of the solar system. The present experiment tested this theory by varying the presence of explicit comparisons between Earth-based and space-based perspectives during a multi-day lesson about the day-night cycle. Children (N=63, Mean age=8.57) were randomly assigned to one of four learning conditions: one that involved guided comparison of perspectives, two that involved similar tasks but without comparison, or a control (no instruction) condition. We found that children in the guided comparison condition had the greatest learning gains on a task that involved demonstrating the day-night cycle using a model Earth and Sun.",>Benjamin Jee>Florencia Anggoro>Natalie Evans>Caitlin Murphy>Jessica Tran>Caroline Morano>Amanda McCarthy>Victoria Jackson,>Worcester State University>College of the Holy Cross>College of the Holy Cross>College of the Holy Cross>College of the Holy Cross>College of the Holy Cross>College of the Holy Cross>College of the Holy Cross,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0614/index.html

2016,"Verifying who ""jumped more"" or ""higher"" in simple events","Sentences with “more” can be used to compare along many different dimensions (e.g., number, height, etc.). Barner, Wagner, and Snedeker (2008) found that participants strongly preferred number as the relevant dimension for comparatives with deverbal nominals like “more jumping,” even when height was an available choice. Would this preference manifest as a choice of number over height pitting the two dimensions against one another with verbal “jumped more”? We animated two objects, A and B, and varied each’s height, duration, and number of jumps, counterbalancing how often A “won” along each dimension. In separate blocks, participants judged whether “A jumped higher/longer/more times/more than B,” and unambiguously chose height with “higher,” duration with “longer,” and number with “more times.” With bare “more,” however, participants said “yes” both by height and number. This study challenges Barner et al’s (2008) idea that the lexical root “jump” determines a comparison by number with “more”.",>Haley Farkas>Alexis Wellwood,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0616/index.html
2016,Language influences attention to Japanese event components in native English-speaking 21- to 24-month-olds,"Japanese and American 13-15-month-old infants distinguish between crossing a bounded ground (e.g., a street) versus an unbounded ground (e.g., a field). In English, the same verb – crossing – expresses both types. While language has been hypothesized to guide infants’ progression from language-general to language-specific event perception (Göksun et al., 2011), no prior studies examined this hypothesis. We presented toddlers who no longer perceive this Japanese distinction in events with novel spatial prepositions (N = 24) or nonlinguistic tones (N = 12) to label bounded versus unbounded grounds. Children presented with labels, but not tones, attended to the differences in ground categories by looking significantly longer to the novel ground type at test. This suggests that above and beyond the attention-getting function associated with non-linguistic auditory stimuli, language uniquely facilitates categorization of event components.",>Natalie Brezack>Haruka Konishi>Roberta Golinkoff>Kathryn Hirsh-Pasek,>University of Delaware>Michigan State University>University of Delaware>Temple University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0617/index.html

We derived estimates for: valence, arousal, dominance, concreteness and age of acquisition (AoA) for 2831 words. Based on the similarity between words we: (1) used projections on a dimension identified as the variable in question in a multidimensional representation, (2) used the k-nearest neighbors values, weighted according to their proximity. Estimates prevailed when based on word associations. Differences between the predictions of the two methods were small. Based on the word association corpus it yielded correlations of .92, .85, and .85, for valence, arousal, and dominance, respectively. Its corresponding correlations based on the text corpus were .80, .74, and .67. For concreteness and AoA, both the association and the text corpus yielded correlations of .88 and .73, respectively.

Fifty students were trained and tested at 2 time points – beginning and end of a semester – in a virtual navigation task (Silcton; Weisberg, et. al., 2014). We hypothesize that a significantly higher number of GIS students as compared to SC students will be Integrators i.e. they will find the most targets within-route and between-route in the virtual environment.

This study addressed this question by examining the role of attention in the development of category learning and transfer. Participants (adults and 4-year-olds) were trained with two categories including deterministic and probabilistic features and their attention was directed to either type of features. After training, participants learned two new categories and their categorization and memory for exemplars were tested. Results indicated that adults and 4-year-olds were able to be trained to use either a similarity-based or rule-based strategy. However, adults failed to transfer and went back to their default rule-based strategy in novel situations, whereas 4-year-olds transferred the learned strategy. Furthermore, in contrast to adults exhibiting better memory for features used in categorization, 4-year-olds remembered multiple features well regardless of categorization.

Research suggests that the semantics of a verb and its arguments determine the verb's syntactic frames, but various theories (Levin & Hovav, 2005) disagree on the nature and complexity of these relationships, in part because most investigations have focused on a small subset of verbs that may not generalize. Investigating the semantic and syntactic relationships present in larger sets of verbs would provide more substantial evidence for evaluating and selecting theories of verb argument structure. We report on initial analyses of the 6000+ verbs and 280+ syntactic frames of VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008), the largest English verb syntax resource available, using nonparametric Bayesian methods (e.g. Shafto et al., 2006) for cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction.",>Jesse Mu>Timothy O'Donnell>Joshua Hartshorne,>Boston College>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Boston College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0621/index.html
2016,Moral Social Media: Heavy Facebook Users Accept Harsher Moral Criticism for Microaggressions,"Microaggressions are unintentional or thoughtless behaviors that convey negative messages to members of minority groups. Due to the attributional ambiguity of microaggressions, people often differ in their judgments about how morally bad acts of microaggression are. To account for this individual variation, we explored the potential influence of heavy social media use on individuals’ moral judgments of microaggressive behaviors. We hypothesized that, because of the relative acceptance of strong blame expressions on social media, heavy Facebook users would endorse intense moral criticism of microaggressions. Participants read about several agents who committed microaggressions and judged the appropriateness of moral criticism (pretested to vary in degrees from “disapprove of,” “chastise,” “chew out,” to “lash out at”) that a friend directed towards the offender. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a strong correlation (r = .47) between increasing degrees of Facebook use and increasing acceptance of harsher moral criticism for microaggressions.",>Boyoung Kim>Joanna Korman>Bertram F.

For both judgments (episodic recognition and probabilistic inference), we observe the influence of both pre-experimental exposure, which is approximated by web-frequencies (e.g., Google search results), and experimental exposure, which is manipulated through an incidental study phase (e.g., a vowel counting task). The results of these experiments allow for an integrative understanding of how different sources of memory accessibility (experimental vs. pre-experiential) are combined, and possibly interfere with one another, depending on the type of memory-related judgment.",>Justin Olds>Julian Marewski,>University of Lausanne>University of Lausanne,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0623/index.html
2016,The role of emotional mediation in musical and vocal sound-color correspondence,"This study investigates the role of emotional mediation in sound-color cross-modal correspondence, using two complementary sets of validated stimuli: the Montreal Affective Voices (MAV; Belin et al., 2008), and Musical Emotional Bursts (MEB; Paquette et al., 2013). These stimuli were presented to participants for color associations, emotional associations, and rated for arousal and valence. The results demonstrated that the same pattern of color association applied across both vocal and musical sounds, which strongly correlated with the perceived emotional connotation of the sound. Sounds across both domains that were rated as high arousal/negative valence were associated with red (anger), sounds rated as high arousal/positive valence were associated with yellow (happiness), and sounds rated as low arousal/negative valence were associated with blue (sadness). The results thus replicate previous research indicating that arousal and valence govern sound-color correspondence, suggesting that cross-modal associations may reflect reciprocal interactions between the connotative meanings of different stimuli.",>Erin Isbilen,">Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0624/index.html
2016,Collaborative Story Construction and Telling for Second Language Learning,"Though utilizing information from the internet is common in language learning, it is often a spontaneous behavior and is not supported by computer programs that are specialized for language learners. In this project, we create a collaborative learning environment for Mandarin Chinese that implements the idea of learning by teaching. The students will learn and practice their language skills by collaboratively designing interactive presentations, such as introducing a place or a type of food with a computer agent, and the scenarios can be used later on by their peers for practicing. During the design process, storytelling techniques such as making an analogy, foreshadowing and flashback will be automatically suggested by the agent for making the presentation more interesting and clear.",>Mei Si,>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0625/index.html
2016,Partnering with Autonomous Vehicles,"Despite the growing prominence and capabilities of self-driving cars, little is known about human interaction with such autonomous vehicles. I am studying human interaction with multiple levels of automation and navigation in a simple driving simulator to discover principles for interaction design that encourage effective partnership between people and automated vehicles. I have conducted two experiments so far. In the first, participants completed driving tasks based on two different factors: automated versus manual control and navigation in low-level versus high-level language, which were combined via a factorial design into four conditions for each participant in the form of different driving scenarios. Performance was measured by travel time, frequency of driving and navigational errors, and levels of user satisfaction. The second iteration had all automated driving, with participants merely supervising while I gave varying amounts of verbal input.",>Umesh Krishnamurthy>Paul Maglio,">University of California Merced, Merced, California, United States>University of California Merced, Merced, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0626/index.html
2016,Mind Wandering during Film Comprehension: The Role of Prior Knowledge and Situational Interest,"We assessed mind wandering (MW) during film comprehension. We predicted that prior-knowledge would aid in the construction of a situation model of the film, which would suppress MW by directing attention towards task-related thoughts, and that interest would moderate this effect. In our experiment, 108 participants either read a short story that depicted the plot (i.e., prior-knowledge condition) or read an unrelated story of equal length (control condition) prior to viewing the 32.5 minute film The Red Balloon. Participants self-reported their interest in viewing the film immediately before the film presentation and reported self-caught instances of MW while viewing the film. The prior-knowledge condition reported less MW compared to the control condition. MW also decreased over the course of the film, but only for the prior-knowledge condition, thereby suggesting a suppression effect. Finally, prior-knowledge effects on MW were only observed when interest was average or high.",>Sidney Dmello>Kris Kopp>Caitlin Mills,">University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America>University of Notre Dame",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0627/index.html
2016,"A concurrent task facilitates, not impedes, the heel-to-toe standing balance in children: The case of a dual-task benefit","Performance in a dual task is typically worse than performance in a single task due to the sharing of limited cognitive capacity. The present study found the opposite results when the task involved postural control in non-typical standing. Thirty-six children aged 4-9 years stood on a force plate for 10 seconds with a normal or heel-to-toe stance. In the dual-task condition, they also performed an auditory or a visuospatial task. They were instructed to achieve high accuracy on the concurrent task while maintaining balance. Standing balance, expressed in terms of the velocity and the trajectory of the center of pressure on the force plate, was significantly better in the dual-task than in the single-task condition. Performances on the concurrent tasks were also better in the dual-task condition. The overall dual-task benefits are attributed to the increased deployment of cognitive capacity specially called for by the balance challenge in non-typical standing.",>Rong-Ju Cherng>Hsien-Ying Chen>Chiu-Yu Cho>Jenn-Yeu Chen,">Department of Physical Therapy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan.

2016,The effect of language impairment on non-symbolic exact quantity representation,"Both English-speakers whose access to number language is artificially compromised by verbal interference and the Pirahã (an Amazonian tribe without exact number words) appear to rely on analog magnitude estimation for representing non-symbolic exact quantities greater than 3. Here, 10 participants with aphasia from stroke performed the same 5 counting tasks from these previous studies. Performance was poorest when targets were not visible during response (70% correct) and best when targets were presented as subitizable groups of 2 and 3 (98% correct). Western Aphasia Battery-Revised subtest scores were reliably correlated with performance across counting tasks suggesting ways that both speech and naming may contribute to errors. Coefficients of variation for particular tasks, and significant correlations between target magnitude with both error rate and size across tasks suggests use of analog magnitude estimation for verbally impaired participants.

2016,Do Open Specifier Positions at Clause Edges Alleviate Working Memory Load?,"In this study I examine the relationship between syntactic working memory and intermediate gap positions in long-distance filler-gap dependencies. An “intermediate” gap position is a structural position, distinct from verbal argument positions, which is available to the filler at a clause edge between its surface dislocated position and its original canonical position. I will use anterior negativity (AN) as an index of working memory resources as the filler is held by the parser before its integration in the final gap position. Under the hypothesis that such an available intermediate gap position offers a temporary integration of the filler, an attenuation of the anterior negativity is expected at the intermediate gap site. However, this attenuation is not observed, suggesting either that this intermediate gap position is in fact not available to the parser as a site of temporary integration, or that such integration has no mitigating effect on working memory resources.",>Ryan Rhodes,>University of Delaware,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0630/index.html
2016,Attentional Enhancement at Event Boundaries,"A fundamental aspect of everyday processing involves identifying discrete events within continuously unfolding sensory experience. However, the processes enabling determination of event boundaries remain poorly understood. Recently, inconsistent conclusions have emerged regarding attentional processes associated with detection of event boundaries. Use of the Dwell-Time Paradigm has indicated enhanced attention at event boundaries (e.g., Hard, Recchia, & Tversky, 2011), whereas evidence from the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation paradigm (e.g., Huff, Papenmeier, & Zacks, 2012) indicates impairment. We employed a change-detection procedure similar to the RSVP, except that the change to be detected was uniform across the entire visual field, rather than varying with respect to the viewer’s spatial locus of attention. Changes occurred either at event boundaries or mid-stream within event segments. With spatial locus of attention rendered irrelevant, participants displayed significantly faster reaction time to changes coinciding with event boundaries, implying that viewers selectively target event boundaries with heightened attention.",>Dare Baldwin>Eric Pederson,">University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, United States>University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0631/index.html
2016,Historical Semantics of Risk,"The key insight in this work is that the events people associate with risk is under systematic change over the past 200 years. Leveraging Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Topics Modeling) and the Google Ngram Corpus, we identified historical and newly-emerging events associated with risk and tracked their relevance over time. We also computed the probability of risk co-occurring with words associated with those identified events to capture a more accurate trend. Several highlights of the findings include: attention on risk has been spreading from one general domain (about losing life and war/battle) to a set of wider, more specific events and activities such as cancer, sex, HIV, smoke, and finance; in addition, the concept of risk has recently become more differentiated, incorporating both cost and benefits, long and short-term consequences. This approach could be extended to study semantic history of a number of other concepts of interest.",>Ying Li>Thomas Hills>Ralph Hertwig,>University of Warwick>University of Warwick>Max Planck Institute for Human Development,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0632/index.html
2016,An explicit theory of sortal representation and some evidence for it.,"Does the acquisition of words like “dog”, “table”, and “sand” require the support of sortal concepts? In arguing for and against sortals, theorists typically contrast representations of unsorted individuals (bare particulars) and sortal representations. As such, bare particular and sortal representations are presented as alternative means of representing concepts like “dog”, “table” and “tree”. Arguments for and against sortals typically proceed in the absence of an explicit characterization of the form of sortal representations. I present an explicit theory of the form of sortal representations. It turns out that, for sortals to do the work they need to do, they must incorporate bare particular representations into the sortal representation. Two experiments provide evidence for the predicted by the proposed theory of sortal representations. I also show how the proposed theory of sortal representation is consistent with recent findings by Rips and colleagues that seem to provide empirical evidence against sortals.",>Sandeep Prasada,">Hunter College, CUNY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0633/index.html
2016,The influence of temporal order on the recognition of causal relations,"Fenker, Waldmann, & Holyoak (2005) found that participants are faster to recognize a causal relation between words presented in predictive (cause first) than in diagnostic order (effect first). We extended these findings to a comparison of abstract and concrete word pairs. Causality may play a more prominent role in abstract concept relations. Given that causally related abstract concepts are not always observable, they may often involve diagnostic reasoning (e.g. inferring motives). Across two experiments, participants made timed judgments of whether abstract and concrete word pairs of equal bidirectional associative strength were causally related. Items were presented in blocks comprising pairs in either predictive or diagnostic order. Reaction times were significantly lower for predictive order compared to diagnostic. This was not moderated by abstractness, but there was a slightly greater effect for concrete pairs. These data indicate that causal relations are likely stored in memory for both abstract and concrete concepts.",>Jane Neal>Katja Wiemer,">Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL>Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0634/index.html
2016,Can Distributional Fitting of Short Semantic Fluency Results Predict ADHD?,"Remembering information can be likened to a search through a network composed of semantically related information. An appropriate search through this network requires an adaptive balance between exploratory and exploitative search behaviors. Without exploration, a searcher will perseverate too long on a semantic area devoid of resources. Without exploitation, a searcher may jump around aimlessly, failing to find the semantic areas with plentiful resources (see Hills, Jones, & Todd, 2012). The semantic fluency task, in which subjects are asked to recall items from a given semantic category, can be used to measure these behaviors. Classically, this task has been used to predict Alzheimer’s susceptibility, but other clinically relevant predictions have required involved semantic analyses. Here, we show that distribution fitting applied to the gross time series of recall events, can be used to easily predict measures of clinical relevance such as Wender Utah ADHD and Zuckerman’s Sensation Seeking scores.",>Janelle Szary>Michael N.

2016,Representations of Entropy and of the Relations Same and Different Early in Human Development,"Animals typically fail 2-item Relational Match to Sample (RMTS), whereas animals from pigeons through primates succeed at 16-item RMTS. Furthermore, training on the 16-item arrays does not transfer to 2-item arrays in these non-human species. Animal researchers conclude that success on 16-item RMTS reflects a perceptual property of the set, variability or entropy, rather than conceptual representations of the relations ‘same’ and ‘different’. Four experiments explore young children’s ability to pass 2-item and 16-item RMTS. Like non-human animals, three- and four-year-olds fail 2-item RMTS while passing the16-item task. As with animals, training with 16-item cards does not facilitate success on 2-item RMTS in four- and five-year-olds. These data, as well as data from within the 16-item task, suggests that young children, like non-human animals, rely on entropy in RMTS tasks. Data from 5 and 6-year-olds suggest a representational change late in the preschool years.",>Rebecca Zhu>Jean-Remy Hochmann>Sophia Sanborn>Susan Carey,">Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States>CNRS, Bron, France>University of California, Berkeley>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0636/index.html
2016,Predictors of lexical stability in an artificially learnt language,"Lexical items in the vocabulary of a language undergo dramatic changes over time, explaining the mechanisms that cause this change has been an important topic for the cognitive sciences. One particular focus for researchers has been understanding the dynamics of change in word forms. The rate (or half-life) at which word forms change over time varies greatly, and corpus-based cladistic studies have shown that certain properties, such as word frequency, length and age of acquisition, can be used to predict this variation. We test through the use of an artificial language learning paradigm the extent to which these psycholinguistic factors affect accurate learning of word forms, linking processes of acquisition with processes of evolutionary change. Our findings provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms that drive diachronic change within a language’s vocabulary, highlighting the important role that the learning process has on lexical change.",>James Brand>Padraic Monaghan,>Lancaster University>Lancaster University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0637/index.html
2016,Predictable stimulus onsets improve memory,"Exploring and remembering are fundamental to many human activities. Characterizing influences on recognition memory can help clarify the workings of memory systems and facilitate design of effective learning environments. Studies of self-directed learning show that a key determinant of self-directed benefits is in choosing when to see the next stimulus, but these results do not establish whether it is the act of choosing or the knowledge of stimulus arrival times that primarily matters. We disentangle these factors by asking whether predictable stimulus timing that is not under participant control still leads to a memory benefit. Participants saw pictures of objects one at a time with either a constant or unpredictable inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and showed better memory with constant timing across a range of ISIs. These results speak to interactions between attention and memory, the efficiency of study protocols, and the factors influencing effective self-directed learning.",>George Kachergis>Shannon Tubridy>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0638/index.html

The model amalgamates perceived witness trustworthiness and access to accurate information as independent elements that describe and predict the impact of the testimony of that particular witness. Across two studies, the model enjoys a good fit with observed posterior ratings of the likelihood of guilt (study 1: R2 = .867, study 2: R2 = .701). Study 1 (n = 101) employs different witness types and reports whilst study 2 (n = 102) employs different witness types, access to accurate information, and reports. The studies suggest the applicability of a Bayesian source credibility model in a legal setting to account for the impact of different witness types.

2016,Exploring Individual Differences in Preschooler's Causal Reasoning Skills in the Physical and Digital Domains,"Do children reason about causal events differently in physically ‘live’ and digital domains? To answer this question, we introduced 35 3-year-olds to the traditional live version and a newly developed digital version of the “blicket detector” task. In both formats, the “blicket detector” first produced an interesting event (e.g., lit up) when a distinctive object (e.g., cylindrical block) touched its surface, but then failed to do so when a different object (e.g., triangular block) did so. After both blocks then simultaneously touched (and activated) the “blicket detector,” children were asked to identify the ‘causal’ block. Children’s performance correlated significantly across the physical and digital trials (r = .4, p = .02). Not only does this study further our understanding of children’s causal reasoning skills in the digital domain, it introduces a major methodological advance with the development of a highly efficient and reliable digital version of the “blicket” task.",>Jessie-Raye Bauer>Amy Booth>Cristine Legare,>University of Texas at Austin>University of Texas at Austin>University of Texas at Austin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0640/index.html
2016,A subject-object asymmetry in the online processing of 'only': evidence from eye-tracking,"While most formal semantic accounts of focus-sensitive particles such as ‘only’ acknowledge that their interpretation requires the integration of contextual information with the linguistic representation, it is less clear how this interaction plays out in real-time. Recent psycholinguistic work in this domain favors an incremental processing story, but divergent results elsewhere complicate this picture. Our findings from two Visual World eye-tracking studies (n = 33, 32) help resolve this conflict, and confirm the existence of an adult processing asymmetry: sentences in which ‘only’ associates with the subject ('Only John bought an apple') take longer to process than object-only sentences ('John only bought an apple'). We find that current accounts of the representation and exhaustification of propositional alternatives invoked by 'only' do not explain this effect. We suggest that differences at the event-structural level — which propositional alternatives arguably map onto — might explain the asymmetry.",>Pooja Paul>Tanya Levari>Dylan Hardenbergh>Jesse Snedeker,>Harvard University>Harvard University>Harvard University>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0641/index.html

We examined how this tendency emerges in the course of development. We incentivized participants to acquire as many points for correct responses as possible, and allowed them to choose between two games of differential difficulty on every trial. Whereas adults systematically chose the easier of the two games, 5-year-olds did not. However, when we gave children feedback on the basis of their choice rather than accuracy, they exhibited evidence of optimization by selecting the easier game. Further, they showed the same pattern when the two games were modified to be identical in difficulty, with only feedback supporting the choice of one game over the other. These findings suggest that children may be cognitive misers, but they rely on external feedback rather than internal signals of effort to optimize their behavior.",>Allison O'Leary>Vladimir Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0642/index.html

2016,Rapid acquisition of novel information: Is disjunctive syllogism necessary for fast mapping?,"We investigated two possible mechanisms that may mediate the rapid acquisition of novel words and their corresponding referents (i.e., fast mapping, FM). In the standard paradigm that examines FM, a novel label is presented alongside a novel object and a familiar object, and subjects are asked to identify the item that corresponds to the novel label. Acquisition of name-object pairing is subsequently assessed. One possible mechanism underlying FM is disjunctive syllogism: the active rejection of the familiar item, which allows for the novel object-to-label mapping (e.g., “I know this is a cricket, so “torato” can’t be referring to that; it must refer to the unfamiliar item.”). Another possible mechanism involves activation of a relevant semantic network (e.g., insect) into which the novel concept can be incorporated. We found that semantic network activation alone is sufficient, and that active rejection is not necessary, for the rapid acquisition of novel object-name associations.",>Hillary Abel>Anna Drummey>Stephanie Vicari>Irene Kan,">Villanova University, Villanova , Pennsylvania, United States>Villanova University, Villanova , Pennsylvania, United States>Villanova University, Villanova , Pennsylvania, United States>Villanova University, Villanova , Pennsylvania, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0644/index.html
2016,Information Processing during Intertemporal Choice: An Investigation using Eye Movement Data,"Intertemporal choices consist of trade-offs between reward magnitude and the delay until those rewards are received. Distaste for delay (i.e., impatience) is related to various undesirable variables including drug use, credit card debt, and low grade point average. These findings have underscored the critical need to better understand intertemporal preferences. Previous work has shown that forcing participants to wait 9 seconds before making an intertemporal choice yields greater patience than when they are forced to wait 3 seconds. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that produced this effect are currently unknown. The current study uses a similar choice paradigm but collects eye movement data in order to non-invasively investigate decision makers’ information processing strategies under short and long deliberation times. Eye movements over the various pieces of choice-relevant information (i.e., delays and magnitudes of rewards) were related to the deliberation time manipulation, individual choices, and individual differences in patience.

2016,Neural Resonance Theory: Entrainment to Missing Pulse Rhythms,"Many rhythm perception experiments employ simple isochronous rhythms, in which synchronous neural or behavioral responses are observed. However, responses at the stimulus frequency do not allow one to distinguish whether synchrony occurs as a response to common input, or as the result of an emergent population oscillation that entrains at a particular frequency. This study aimed to investigate whether the sensorimotor system, as measured by 32- channel cortical EEG, would entrain to a complex rhythm at the pulse frequency even when the complex rhythm contained no spectral power at that frequency. Dynamical analysis predicts neural oscillation will emerge at such a “missing” pulse frequency. We report evidence of response in the EEG to missing 2 Hz pulse rhythms. These data support the theory that rhythmic synchrony occurs as the result of an emergent population oscillation that entrains at this particular frequency. We also discuss generators of the missing pulse response.",>Charles Wasserman>Jung Nyo Kim>Edward Large>Erika Skoe,">University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA>University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA>University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA>University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0646/index.html

Seventy 4-5 year-olds were shown trials consisting of pairs of agents who had the same numbers of blocks but made different structures (e.g., horizontal line vs. vertical tower, castle structure vs. two piles of blocks). Children were asked which structure was easier to make (Difficulty condition) or who was done first (Time condition). Even the youngest participants were successful in determining which structure is more difficult, but their estimates of time showed improvement with age.

To explore the extent to which children’s overextension or underextension of emotion words is influenced by mothers’ use of those words, the present study analyzed how mothers talk to their 15- to 18-month-old children. Mothers were asked to explain to their children the emotions of a model using particular facial expressions or those of characters in stories. The results indicated that mothers used some emotion words in a manner that was too wide and other emotion words too narrowly. Mothers’ use of emotion words is partly related to children’s application patterns of those words, especially regarding facial expressions. Regarding the use of emotion words for characters in stories, other factors aside from mothers’ use can contribute to children’s semantic domain of emotion.",>Mai Hamana,>the Universtiy of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0649/index.html
2016,Effects of categorization on item memory and forgetting,"Memory and categorization have different goals. The goal of memory is to keep a distinct record of each individual item. In contrast, categorization aims to treat items as equivalent in some way despite differences. When memory for items is the priority, research suggests that adults are able to bind many elements of an experience to form a complex memory structure, and that such binding may help guard against forgetting due to interference from learning in similar situations. When categorization is the priority, however, complex binding structures in memory may impede generalization. In this experiment adults demonstrated robust memory for items after learning one set of categories, but much worse memory for items that were categorized differently in a second set. Results suggest that this interference was due to failure to form complex binding structures in memory, as a result of selective attention during categorization.",>Kevin Darby>Vladimir Sloutsky,">The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0650/index.html

Accurate predictions are particularly important in the domain of health, where illness knowledge directly influences patient outcomes. To understand how well peoples’ illness expectations were aligned, we asked participants to estimate durations for 9 illnesses, and compared their responses to the real-world distributions. We found that for common acute illnesses (e.g., the cold) people make accurate predictions, whereas for rare chronic illnesses (e.g., COPD) people make comparatively poor predictions. Further, we found that participants overestimate the prevalence of every illness, especially for those that are more common (e.g., the cold). Taken together, these results suggest that people more accurately estimate the duration of common acute illnesses, but this may cause them to overestimate the prevalence of these illnesses.

We assess whether successive words are learned in close semantic clusters or not (exploitation vs. exploration) and the structure of these clusters. Words are defined in terms of topic distribution in the parental input (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Distance between successively learned words is measured as cosine distance between their topic distribution. Word acquisition can be accurately described as foraging in a sparse resource environment with very local path dependence (power law distribution: alpha=3.9±0.2; detrended fluctuation analysis: alpha=0.6). Words are acquired in semantically close clusters of 2-4 successive words (Recurrence Quantification Analysis: L=2, LMAX=4, V=2, VMAX=4).

The present studies build on previous developmental research which suggests that the early emerging system for modal cognition treats norm-violations (e.g., immoral actions) as impossible. Across two studies, we provide evidence that a similar system for representing possibilities persists in human adults, despite the development of an additional capacity for reasoning about possibilities in a way that is independent of considerations of normality. Study 1 distinguishes between these two ways of representing possibilities. Study 2 demonstrates that the early-emerging system is often recruited when adults make high-level cognitive judgments.",>Jonathan Phillips>Fiery Cushman,>Harvard University>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0653/index.html
2016,The Effect of Varying Problem Contexts on Learning Probability Rules,"While previous research shows that varying problem contexts generally facilitates learning (Ranzijin, 1991), it is still unknown how much variability is ideal. Since it is often more economical for teachers to use consistent problem contexts, it is valuable to know how much variability is needed. We examined this in teaching probability. Students randomly assigned to one of three groups learned four rules with four worked examples each, differing in context variability: One group learned four rules with the same cover story (all examples for all rules used cards), the second group with different cover stories per rule (multiplication taught with cards, permutation, with spinners), and the third group with varying cover stories within each rule (addition taught with cards, spinners, marbles, and dice). Learning with context varying within rules led to the greatest learning gains from pretest to posttest. We discuss implications of these findings and underway follow-up research.",>Tiantian Jin>Marianna Lamnina,>Columbia University>Columbia University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0654/index.html
2016,Analyzing experimental paradigms under modification on web-based experiment platforms,"Experimental paradigms are particular experiments that can be modified along a variety of dimensions to answer questions different than the original inquiry but which have similar content or structure. For example, the original looking-time study is an experimental paradigm that has shaped developmental psychology. Thomas Kuhn proposed that, under normal conditions, experimentation by modification of previous paradigms is how science progresses. Web-based experiment platforms (e.g., psiturk and Wallace) are installed with collections of working experimental paradigms that are pre-populated with structures necessary to use the platform, but which can be modified to allow users to generate novel experiments. Because these experiments are implemented in code, we can identify exactly how the code is modified in practice, and begin to directly measure and even test Kuhn's hypothesis regarding the progress of normal science. I will describe possible methods for achieving this, ideally providing others a paradigm to modify.",>Michael Pacer,">University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0655/index.html
2016,Sex Differences in Mental Rotation Performance: The Self-fulfilling Prophecy of Gender Stereotypes,"Male advantage on spatial tasks may be explained in part by gender stereotypes (Nash 1975). The current study investigated the effect of awareness of sex differences in mental rotation on mental rotation (MR) performance. We hypothesized that students with negative stereotypes would score significantly lower than students who were unaware or held positive stereotypes. Participants – 285 undergraduates — completed the Shepard & Metzler (1971) MR task followed by a short online survey. Preliminary analysis revealed a significant sex difference in mental rotation performance F (1, 256) = 9.68, p=. 002. There was no main effect of awareness on MR performance. Interestingly, there was a significant interaction between sex and awareness on MR performance, F (1,256) =6.77, p=. 010. Results on the role of awareness in cognitive strategy selection will be presented. By understanding gender stereotypes associated with spatial ability, we can reduce the gender gap found in STEM disciplines.",>Alina Nazareth>Shannon Pruden,>Temple University>Florida International University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0656/index.html
2016,Relative influence of anchoring and centering biases in reconstructive memory,"We report the results of an experiment probing the relative influence of centering and anchoring biases in reconstructive memory for line lengths. On each of 90 trials participants (N=120) viewed a target line, which they reproduced after a delay by adjusting a response line. We manipulated the starting size of this response line in three conditions: one provided an anchoring bias opposite the centering bias (expand condition), one in the same direction (contract condition) and one that provided no anchoring bias (control). We eliminated the centering bias in the expand condition, increased it in the contract condition, and showed an attenuated centering bias in the control condition. We discuss the implications for these results in relation to cognitive models of stimulus reproduction that employ the method of serial reproduction. We suggest that experiments of this type should carefully control for the possible influence of anchoring biases in reconstructive memory.",>Sean Duffy>L.

2016,"Making invisible ""trouble"" visible: Self-repair increases abstraction of referring expressions","A central finding in dialogue research is that interlocutors rapidly converge on referring expressions which become progressively contracted and abstract. However, there is currently no consensus on which mechanisms underpin convergence: The interactive alignment model (Pickering and Garrod) favours priming, the grounding model (Clark, 1996) prioritizes positive feedback, while Healey (2002) demonstrates the importance of miscommunication. To investigate convergence in closer detail we report a variant of the “maze-task"". Participants communicate via a text-based chat tool which selectively transforms participants' private turn-revisions into public self-repairs that are made visible to the other participant. Dyads who received these artificially transformed turns used more abstract referring expressions, but performed worse at the task. We argue this is due to self-repairs having a beneficial effect of amplifying naturally occurring miscommunication (Healey et al., 2013), while also having a deleterious effect of decreasing participants' confidence in the conventions established during the task.",>Gregory Mills>Gisela Redeker,">University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands>University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0658/index.html
2016,"Inferring actions, intentions, and causal relations in a neural network","From a young age, we can select actions to achieve desired goals, infer the goals of other agents, and learn causal relations in our environment through social interactions. Crucially, these abilities are productive or generative: for instance, we can impute desires to others that we have never held ourselves. This capacity has been captured by the powerful Bayesian Theory of Mind formalism, but it remains to forge connections to the rich neural data around action selection, goal inference, and social causal learning. How can productive inference about actions and intentions arise within the neural circuitry of the brain? Using the recently-developed linearly solvable Markov decision process, we present a neural network model which permits a distributed representation of tasks. Such a representation allows the expression of infinite possibilities by combining a finite set of bases, enabling truly generative inference of actions, goals, and causal relations in a neural network framework.",>Andrew Saxe,">Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0659/index.html
2016,Forming spatial habits in the wild: Examining stabilization in classroom seating arrangements,"Previous research suggests that individuals tend to form spatial habits (i.e., placing objects in consistent locations in space) when interacting with objects in the environment (Zhu & Risko, in press). However, it remains unclear how such spatial habits develop over time. One hypothesis suggests that spatial habit formation may involve a process of stabilization whereby individuals’ spatial behaviour becomes progressively fixed over time. We examined this hypothesis by tracking students’ seating behaviour in a classroom over the course of 12 weeks. Although individuals’ overall seating choice tended to cluster near where they initially sat, we did not find evidence that seating behaviour stabilized over time. However, a significant curvilinear relation was found between seating choice and time such that seating choice near the beginning and end of the 12-week period were more varied than those in the middle. Implications of this study for understanding spatial habit formation will be discussed.",>Mona Zhu>Evan Risko,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0660/index.html
2016,An action dynamics study of the onset of prediction,"A recent approach in cognitive science argues that prediction is a core concept underlying cognition, to the extent that brains could be referred to as ""prediction machines"" (Clark, 2013). Extending experimental paradigms to explore prediction facilitate tests of this claim. In a previous study we introduced a statistical learning paradigm to detect when participants are predicting during implicit/explicit learning. The results revealed that participants tend to rapidly switch into a predictive mode almost as a discrete strategy. While this intriguing possibility was not directly explored in the original study, in this project we repurposed the task to explicitly explore the onset of predictive behaviors. Through a mouse-tracking task, participants get to learn the statistical structure in a sequence of flashing dots while their mouse movements are being recorded. Findings reveal the level of statistical structure in the environment that triggers the rapid onset of predictive behavior in participants.",>Maryam Tabatabaeian>Rick Dale,">University of California Merced, merced, California, United States>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0661/index.html
2016,The ON/IN scale of semantic extensions of adpositions: testing through artificial language learning,"Cross-linguistically, the semantic extensions of certain adpositions obey an implicational scale, ranging from the situation class of prototypical ON (support from below) to prototypical IN (full containment) (Bowerman & Pederson 1992, Levinson & Meira 2003, Feist 2008). However, the nature of this phenomenon remains unresolved. Two general accounts are possible: 1) the patterned output is the simply the result of diachronic factors and speakers learn which extensions go with each adposition without any particular analysis, or 2) there may be some online psychological reality to the scale. Language learning may be a fruitful domain to test this second account. Using an artificial language learning paradigm, subjects are trained on alternative forms paired with scenes representing some situation classes on the scale. In testing, they generalize the use of these forms to novel classes. Preliminary findings suggest a generalization of forms to uses in ways consistent with a psychological representation.",>Matthew Stave>Eric Pederson,">University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, USA>University of Oregon",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0662/index.html
2016,Time Course of Fidelity and Contributing Factors to Long-Term Memory,"Various models have been implemented to explain long-term memory (Brady, et al., 2013; Lew, et al., 2015), with some being derived from studies of visual working memory (Bays, et al. 2009; Zhang & Luck, 2008). The implicit assumption is that processes and mechanisms of working memory also exist in long-term memory. However, the findings of fidelity and contributing factors are highly varied (e.g., Persaud & Hemmer, 2014; Schurgin & Flombaum, 2015) To address what happens to memory traces as they transition from visual working into long-term memory and what factors, such as prior knowledge and guessing, contribute to the “lifespan” of long-term memory, we implemented three models: the standard remember-guess model, a three-component remember-guess model, and a Bayesian mixture model and evaluated these models against data from a continuous recall task. The results clarify the time course of fidelity in long-term memory and pinpoints specific factors that contribute to memory.",>Kimele Persaud>Pernille Hemmer,">Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey>Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0663/index.html

2016,Understanding human facial attractiveness from multiple views,"Facial attractiveness has long been a topic of interest for cognitive scientists. Early psychological research has found that averageness, distinctiveness and familiarity of a face can influence facial attractiveness. However, faces also convey rich social information. How various social features are related to facial attractiveness hasn't been systematically studied before. We investigate facial attractiveness in the context of social feature evaluation and find that social attributes like appearing interesting and sociable contribute to facial attractiveness whereas appearing boring, and humble are negatively correlated with attractiveness. We further compare social features of faces with the physical configuration of faces and we are able to use geometric features to predict facial attractiveness. We further study the individual differences on attractiveness perception and find out that. Our study illustrates that social attributes and pixel information can go hand in hand to facilitate attractiveness prediction.",>Amanda Song>Linjie Li>Vicente Malave>Gary Cottrell>Angela Yu,">University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0665/index.html
2016,Causal perception is constrained by principles of Newtonian mechanics,"Humans irresistibly perceive certain events as causal. We show, for the first time, that there is not one monolithic representation of causality in perception. Rather, there are multiple categories of causal events in perception, one of which is constrained by an approximation of a Newtonian mechanical principle: in an elastic collision, a struck object cannot move at more than double the speed of the object striking it. We show that adults are sensitive to causal (but not non-causal) events that violate this principle in a visual search task (Experiment 1), that this sensitivity is due to a categorical boundary and not the salience of this event (Experiment 2), and that the threshold for detecting these events approximates this Newtonian limit (Experiment 3). Finally, we argue that categorical boundaries are a core feature of causal perception, as they are present around the age at which causal perception first emerges (Experiment 4).",>Jonathan Kominsky>Brent Strickland>Annie Wertz>Claudai Elsner>Karen Wynn>Frank Keil,>Yale University>Institut Jean Nicod>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Yale University>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0666/index.html
2016,"Finger Gnosis Predicts Children’s Numeracy, Despite Controlling for Visuo-Spatial Memory","Finger gnosis, the ability to mentally represent one’s fingers, predicts numeracy in children (Penner-Wilger et al., 2007, 2009) and adults (Penner-Wilger et al., 2014, 2015). It has been argued that the relation may reflect visuo-spatial memory, rather than finger gnosis ability per se. This rival hypothesis was not supported in adults (Penner-Wilger et al., 2015), but here we examined it in children, using both a novel set of Grade 1 participants (N = 119) and a separate set previously reported on (Penner-Wilger et al., 2007, 2009; N=146). In multiple regressions, for each set of participants, finger gnosis significantly predicted numeracy skills, measured using the KeyMath Numeration subtest. Moreover, the relation between finger gnosis and numeracy held for both sets of participants, despite controlling for visuo-spatial memory, measured using a Corsi-block test. These findings suggest that the relation between finger gnosis and numeracy is robust and does not reflect visuo-spatial memory.",>Marcie Penner-Wilger>Sheri-Lynn Skwarchuk>Carla Sowinski>Jo-Anne Lefevre,>King’s University College at Western University>University of Winnipeg>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0667/index.html

The current study examines improvement in spatial thinking in physics undergraduate students over the course of a semester. Students completed the Shepard and Metzler (1971) task at two time points– beginning and end of a semester – where they were asked to determine if two 3D figures were a match or mirror-images of each other. A Tobii X60 eye-tracker was used to record eye movement as an indirect measure of cognitive strategy selection. Preliminary analysis show a significant improvement in mental rotation performance from time point 1 (M=31.867, SD=5.027) to time point 2 (M=35.333, SD=3.885) t(14)=-3.014, p=.009.

2016,Pragmatic inference in definite and indefinite contexts,"Previous studies have shown that children have difficulty inferring intended referents of definite/indefinite determiners: e.g., that ""Give me the ball"" implies a specific ball, while ""Give me a ball"" requests any ball from a larger set. Here, we show that these findings need not indicate a fragile capacity for pragmatic reasoning because adults only make such inferences within specific contexts. Across four studies, we found that when presented with novel labels in definite contexts (the dax), adults consistently selected unique objects as the referent (though they were not at ceiling), suggesting they interpreted the definite as conveying specificity. Strikingly, however, when presented in indefinite contexts (a dax), subjects did not reliably link novel labels to objects of a larger set of kind-members, unless the context explicitly encouraged them to reason about the intended addressee. Together, these findings suggest that failures to make inferences about definiteness need not reflect pragmatic incompetence.",>Kelsey Moty>Mahesh Srinivasan,">Lehigh University>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0669/index.html

We used objective, behavioral data (e.g., eye fixation patterns), which are compatible with multiple representations, to compare cognitive models. Specifically, we compared seven cognitive models including working memory activation (weighting values as a function of the number of and duration of fixations), working memory constraint (e.g., recency + primacy, last four), or Bayesian models (e.g., first fixation set as prior). Our task presented sets of 5 to 10 3-digit numbers (framed as the result of a home run derby) and asked participants to predict how far the next ball would be hit. The same fixation data were loaded into each model to create a unique estimate, which was then compared to the participant’s actual prediction.

2016,A Cognitively Realistic Model of Decision Making in Ocean Ecology,"There is strong evidence that a key determinant of the ecological state of the world’s oceans is the decision-making of fishers and policy-makers. There is a large empirical literature on the complex reality of human decision-making, but a comparative lack of work bringing detailed cognitive facts to models of aggregate behavior of this kind. We show how a psychologically realistic description of decision-makers can be integrated into a large-scale ocean systems model, going beyond profit maximization agent-based models. In particular, we seek to model the questions that frame decisions of different types of fishers and the motivating reasons on the basis of which those questions are resolved. The broader purpose of the model is to see how those patterns could inform regulatory policy. We present the basic architecture of the model and the data gathering tools that will allow us to adapt the model to fishers in different environments.",>Philipp Koralus>Jens Madsen>Ernesto Carella>Richard Bailey,>University of Oxford>University of Oxford>University of Oxford>University of Oxford,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0671/index.html

A novel task using naturalistic photographic stimuli and patient-friendly procedures was used to test event-related semantic knowledge. In the task, participants decided whether depicted events were normal (represented in semantic memory) or were abnormal (not represented in semantic memory). Performance on this Event task was correlated with deficits in action- and object-concept processing and on standardized language measures, especially action- and verb-processing deficits. Logistic regression analyses examined lesion correlates of patient performance on the Event task. Surprisingly, increasing LH lesion size in action ROIs was associated with improved performance on the event-knowledge task. These findings suggest that action processing may play a special role in event-related semantic memory representations. Furthermore, they are consistent with recent claims that the right hemisphere may be especially important for activation of event-related knowledge.",>Chia-Ming Lei>Haley C. Dresang>Michelle B.

We assessed the influence of the mode of presentation of stimuli on the modality-switch effect in a property verification priming paradigm. Participants were required to perform a property verification task on a target sentence (e.g., “butter is yellowish”, “leaves rustle”) presented either visually or aurally after having been presented with a prime sentence (e.g., “the light is flickering”, “the sound is echoing”) that could either share both, one or none of the target’s mode of presentation and content modality. Results showed that the presentation and the content-driven effects were not cumulative. We conclude that the MSE is a two-fold effect which can occur at two different levels of information processing (i.e., perceptual and semantic).",>Elisa Scerrati>Luisa Lugli>Anna M.

Here we explore the relationship between inhibitory control and bilingual proficiency in 43 8-year-old English-Chinese children in Singapore where bilingualism is prolific. Proficiency estimates are based on Oral and Written exam scores and caretaker estimates (including use and exposure). Children completed English and Chinese Stroop, where each task comprised 75% incongruent trials. Stroop effects were calculated for both languages. Higher English scores (written and oral) and English use predicted smaller English Stroop interference. Conversely, higher Chinese exposure and use predicted smaller Chinese Stroop interference. Thus, language proficiency, use and exposure influence inhibitory control, reiterating the need to consider bilingual proficiency when studying the relationship between bilingualism and attention. Since Stroop effects differ depending on language, bilinguals should be tested in both languages for verbal EF tasks.",>Carissa Kang,">Cornell University, ITHACA, New York, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0674/index.html
2016,Linguistic recursion and Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Both first-order and second-order false-belief mastery are important in acquisition of Theory of Mind. Our logical analysis of second-order false-belief tasks shows that this sort of reasoning involves recursion. Language involves recursion as well; recursive possessive and complements clauses are examples. Second-order social reasoning depends on both individual cognitive resources and immersion in a wide range of interactive contexts. But since the ‘usual’ interactive contexts do not make the same sense to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), it has been proposed that they use language as scaffolding in false-belief understanding. We hypothesize that competency in linguistic recursion predicts second-order false-belief mastery for children with ASD. We investigate this by training children with ASD to better comprehend and produce recursive possessive and complement clauses. We have developed and validated a tool to measure the recursion competency in the Danish language, and we apply this in a randomized controlled training study.",>Irina Polyanskaya>Torben Braüner>Patrick Blackburn,>Roskilde University>Roskilde University>Roskilde university,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0675/index.html

In this study, we examined this phenomenon in terms of word appearance information in fiction (story texts), nonfiction (explanation texts), and web text using latent semantic analysis (LSA). In a human experiment with Japanese undergraduates, we replicated fiction (story) text effectivity. Participants who often read story texts achieved the highest vocabulary test scores. Then, in a corpus experiment, we constructed a story text corpus, explanation text corpus, and web text corpus of identical size. Based on these corpora, we calculated the LSA similarities between words, and simulated answering the same vocabulary test as used in the human experiment. The corpus experiment demonstrated the nonfiction (explanation) text effectively, that is, the explanation corpus was the highest.

The current study explored the role of context in the form of negation in artificial language learning. It was predicted that words trained in an entirely negated context would show lower average correctness in the testing phase than those trained entirely in the affirmative or in the combined contexts. Eighteen artificial nouns were trained using the prefixes “an-” meaning “not the” or “o-” meaning “the” to mark negation. In the testing phase, participants were tested without the prefix on word stems only.

Twenty-four middle school students were randomly assigned to work with a High- or Low-Knowledge virtual peer to collect data and generate weather predictions. Students evaluated their own data relative to the peer’s; they could either ""Choose"" which note to keep, or to ""Agree/Disagree"" with the peer’s suggested choice of note.

2016,Implicit updating of object representation via predictive associations,"An adaptive function of the visual system is that it flexibly updates existing representations of objects upon changes. Such updating can also alter the representations of associated objects that are not directly observable. What mechanism supports this process? We propose that statistical learning provides a channel through which changes in one object are automatically transferred to related objects. Observers viewed a temporal sequence of paired circles. One circle in each pair then changed in size, and observers recalled the size of the other circle. When the first circle enlarged (or shrank), the second circle was judged to be larger (or smaller), suggesting that the change was automatically transferred to the predicted object (Experiment 1). The same, however, was not true if the second circle changed in size (Experiment 2). No observer was explicitly aware of the circle pairs. Thus, statistical learning enables the implicit updating of representations through predictive associations.",>Ru Qi Yu>Jiaying Zhao,">University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada>University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0681/index.html

They were asked to engage in a rule discovery task. The task was designed so that hypothesis revision was necessary for the participants to find the correct rule. The results showed that performance both in the free collaboration and in the metacognitive suggestion collaboration with grounding support conditions was higher than that in the solo condition. We concluded that metacognitive suggestions alone can facilitate hypothesis revision as well as free collaboration and that grounding support is necessary for the facilitative effect to be obtained.,>Sachiko Kiyokawa>Kazuhiro Ueda>Yoshimasa Ohmoto,>Nagoya University>The University of Tokyo>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0682/index.html
2016,Tactile protocol analysis: Observations of novices reading data tables by touch,"The “Cognitive Science of Tactile Graphics Project” at the University of Sussex is studying how experienced and novice users of tactile graphics read diagrams by touch. One goal of the project is to design novel tactile formats that specifically support ready access to, and rich interpretations of, information in tactile materials by people with visual impairment. This presentation focuses upon the development of a Tactile Protocol Analysis (TPA) method for the transcription, segmentation, coding and interpretation of tactile graphic reading behaviours. TPA is challenging because both hands may be performing separate actions over different timescales and fingers of one hand may themselves be performing different actions. To initially demonstrate the utility of the method, 24 novice tactile readers’ performance on a data table search task was analyzed, from which hypotheses were formulated about the impact of object recognition skill on overall patterns of search.",>Peter Cheng>Panayiota Polycarpou>Grecia Garcia Garcia>Frances Aldrich,>University of Sussex>Cyprus University of Technology>University of Sussex>University of Sussex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0683/index.html
2016,In the event of a turn exchange: Visual information the perception of turn-taking behavior in natural conversation,"Everyday conversation is composed of a rapid exchange of turns between talkers as they communicate. The speed of these exchanges implies simultaneous perception and production of conversational cues relevant to turn-taking behavior. Natural face-to-face conversation involves a rich set of these social cues including visual information whose contribution to perception of turns has yet to be examined. Our studies investigated the influence of visual information in perceiving a turn exchange. We examined the time-course of the use of these visual cues during turn judgments. Results show that visual information is sufficient but not necessary for perceiving turn exchanges. Further, the temporal precision with which auditory cues influence turn perception is greater than that of visual information. We suggest that although auditory cues dominate the perception of turn exchanges, reliance on the various sources of information is flexible and may follow highly sensitive timelines.",>Nida Latif>Agnès Alsius>K.g.

2016,An Eye For Figurative Meaning: The Effects of Familiarity on Metaphor Comprehension,"The career of metaphor hypothesis suggests that processing preference is a result of conventionality whereby conventional metaphors are processed through categorization, and novel ones processed through comparison. Alternatively, the categorization model predicts that apt metaphors are processed as categorizations whether or not they are conventional. However, research has largely ignored another known factor to influence metaphor processing, namely familiarity. The categorization model predicts familiarity to play no role in deciding on processing strategy. On the other hand, the career of metaphor hypothesis predicts that familiarity to play a facilitating role in metaphor comprehension. In this experiment, we used the eye tracking paradigm and controlled for aptness and conventionality, and manipulated familiarity in order to test these predictions. Our initial results support the career of metaphor hypothesis suggesting that familiarity facilitates metaphor processing. We discuss the implications these results have on the psycholinguistic models and briefly speculate on their philosophical consequences.",>Chris Genovesi>Michael Vertolli,">Carleton University , Ottawa , Ontario, Canada>Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0685/index.html

2016,Implicit versus explicit language learning: Differential effects of working memory and learning styles,"Understanding the process of adult language learning has recently undergone advances due to the consideration of how individual differences (IDs) in cognitive processing, such as working memory (WM), affect acquisition. We know that implicit versus explicit learning conditions also influence learning, however, the potential interactions between IDs, the efficacy of implicit versus explicit learning, and different types of linguistic information are largely unknown. In this study, we tested learning of syntax and grammatical case under two conditions: incidental and explicit rule-provision (“instructed”). We also assessed individuals’ WM, phonological working memory (PWM), and learning styles. Significant learning effects were found for word order and case in both learning conditions. For case, but not for word order, the instructed group outperformed the incidental group. Regarding IDs, incidental learning of case was marginally related to individuals’ WM; instructed learning of case was related to PWM. For learning styles, there was a negative relationship between learning of word order in the instructed condition and a deductive learning style. These results reveal the complex relationships among cognitive processes in explicit and implicit language learning across different aspects of language structure, and in relation to cognitive IDs.",>Sarah Grey>Christine Schoetensack>Kimberly Bell>Padraic Monaghan>Patrick Rebuschat,">Fordham University

2016,Enhancing Creativity in Children by Imparting Chess Training,"Creativity is the ability to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions. The present study, funded by Indian Government, analysed the effect of one year chess training program on the creativity of school-going children of both genders. A pre-test post-test with control group design was used. The sample comprised 64 children: 32 children each in experimental (Mean age=11.86, SD=1.44) and control (Mean age=12.03, SD=1.14) groups. Children in the experimental group underwent weekly chess training with Winning Moves Chess Curriculum. Creativity was assessed by Indian adaption of Wallach-Kogan Creativity Test. Pre–intervention equivalence of the two groups was established. Independent t test analysis revealed that the experimental group had statistically significant gains in total creativity and Instances and Alternate Uses subtests compared to the control group. The authors conclude that systematic chess intervention increases creativity in children.

2016,The role of grammatical form in generalizing principled and statistical properties,"Asymmetric generalization patterns for definite and indefinite singular generics In two experiments, we investigated the role of grammatical form in inferring the conceptual status of properties in generic sentences. We trained participants on novel properties in pseudoword sentences with bare plural (BP), indefinite (IS) and definite singular (DS) subjects. In the test phase, participants rated the relationship between trained properties and novel subjects: We found that, compared to BP, properties trained in the IS condition increase expectations of principled connections whereas DS-trained properties diminish expectations of statistical connections. BP subjects acted as a control since they were equally judged to be statistically or principally connected. These results support the theoretical claim that IS have quantificational force and DS directly refer to kinds. They leave open the puzzle of the nature of BP subjects which seem to be ambiguous between the two and also the only one to convey statistical connections.",>Kim Kristina Fuellenbach>E.

2016,Priming Spatial Reference Frames for Memory,We examined the role of spatial frames of reference in memory. Participants first verified verbal descriptions of visual scenes and spatial relations among objects. The intrinsic and relative frames of reference (FoR) were used in the descriptions with varying degrees of frequency (availability) and veridicality (reliability). Descriptions in the two reference frames could either be equally distributed in terms of validity or were biased towards one of the two spatial frames. Participants’ performance on the memory task was sensitive to priming from the spatial FoRs and their information distribution characteristics. These findings provide evidence that spatial frames of reference can influence spatial memory and that this influence depends on the frequency of use of a given frame of reference and on the frequency with which it is associated with valid and reliable information.,>Elena Andonova,>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0690/index.html
2016,Deep Learning and Attentional Bias in Human Category Learning,"Human category learning is known to be a function of both the complexity of the category rule and attentional bias. A classic and critically diagnostic human category problem involves learning integral stimuli (correlated features) using a condensation rule, or separable stimuli (independent features) using a filtration rule. Human category learning shows differential learning based on category rules that either require attentional binding or ignoring features. It has been shown that neural networks learning with backpropagation cannot differentially learn or distribute attention without built in perceptual bias. In effect neural networks fail to integrate the complexity of learning with the representational bias of the stimuli. In this paper we show that Deep Learning networks, through successive re-encoding and the development of more sensitive feature detectors, learn both the category rules while modeling the attentional bias consistent with the human performance in a task of categorizing realistic 3D-modeled faces.",>Leyla Roksan Caglar>Stephen Jose Hanson,">Rutgers University, Newark>Rutgers University, Newark",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0691/index.html

We examined the psychological status, personal factors, and social factor of undergraduate students (N=64) and got summaries of a story, Chronicle of a Death Foretold from them. As transfer learning, we collected 38,265 movie review data to train a sentimental analysis model based on convolutional neural network, using the model to score each summary. The results of CES-D and PANAS show the relationship between emotion and memory retrieval; depressed people have shown a tendency of representing a story more negatively, and seemed less expressive. People with full of emotion have retrieved their memory more expressively, using more negative words. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: First, we lighten the relationship between emotion and its effects on storing or retrieving memories. Second, we suggest objective methods to evaluate the intensity of emotion in words, using a sentimental analysis model.",>Hwiyeol Jo>Yohan Moon>Jongin Kim>Jeong Ryu,>Seoul National University>Sungkyunkwan University>Seoul National University>Yonsei University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0692/index.html
2016,Reexamining the Unaccusative Hypothesis: a Visual World Paradigm study,"The Unaccusative Hypothesis (UH) predicts that the subject of an unaccusative is mentally reactivated in the object position. Previous psycholinguistic studies have reported evidence of reactivation (Friedmann et al 2008, Koring et al 2012). However, these studies did not equate the unaccusative and unergative stimuli, resulting in confounds which jeopardize their conclusions. We reexamined UH with two Visual World Paradigm experiments carefully controlled for the potential confounds in the previous studies. On each trial, participants (n=40; n=52) saw 4 black-and-white drawings and heard a sentence. In the test condition, but not the control condition, one image was semantically related to subject of the sentence. We measured the proportion of looks to the target image at three time regions after the verb onset and found a robust match-effect (p’s<.05) but no differences between the unaccusative and unergative conditions.

2016,Negation affects processing of correct and incorrect information: A visual-world paradigm for misinformation,"The current study investigated how lexical priming and negation affects encoding and retrieval of information. Studies have shown people encode and retrieve misinformation from memory, but the mechanisms of encoding and retrieval are not well understood. To address this, an eye-tracking paradigm was designed to examine probabilistic activation during retrieval of accurate or inaccurate information. Participants read four different kinds of texts that varied by if they were affirmative or negated and whether they contained accurate or inaccurate information. After participants read all texts, eye fixations were tracked in a visual world paradigm with four plausible answers on screen in each corner to choose from. Suppression was observed in groups that did not produce misinformation. When participants answered correctly, despite reading misinformation, we observed misinformation being inhibited instead of primed. Mechanisms of processing true and false information and the interplay between language and conceptual formation are discussed.",>Jeffrey Viaud>Stephanie Huette,>University of Memphis>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0694/index.html
2016,Lexicalization Typology of Realization Events in Mandarin Chinese,"There has been a hot debate on the typological status of Mandarin Chinese in Talmyan framework of Verb-framed languages (V-languages) and Satellite-framed Languages(S-languages). However, most previous studies focus on motion events, while other macro-events (Talmy, 2000) receive little attention. The present study aims to investigate event of realization in Mandarin Chinese with experimental method. The analysis of elicited data shows that: (1) predicates of Mandarin realization events are mostly bipolar resultative verb compounds, which have the semantic feature of [+agent], [+instrument], and [+state change]. This proves that “result” is a semantic prime in Chinese verb semantics. (2) Lexicalization patterns of realization events in Mandarin represent more of S-language, but Mandarin also shows the characteristics of V-language. The difference between S-language patterns and V-language patterns is significant, and the general tendency is: S-language>V-language. Overall, the results indicate that the lexicalization typology of Mandarin realization events falls into a complementary typological framework.",>Yu Deng>Fuyin Li,">School of Foreign Languages, Beihang University, Beijing, China>School of Foreign Languages, Beihang University, Beijing, China",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0695/index.html
2016,An Analogical Model of Pretense,"Pretense has been implicated as playing a role in the development of many cognitive and social skills. Despite the importance and ubiquity of this phenomena, few computational models of pretense exist. We propose a model of pretense via analogical abduction. We suggest that pretense occurs via structural alignment. Where a mismatch occurs (i.e. something in the pretend scenario is not the same as its aligned match in an equivalent real-world scenario), a re-representation must take place in order for pretense to continue. For example, a seashell may be re-represented as a cup (as in Fein, 1975) or an empty cup may be re-represented as full (as in Onishi et al., 2007). We show that this model can explain results from two empirical studies, including failures in pretense.",>Irina Rabkina>Ken Forbus,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0696/index.html
2016,A Model of Language-Guided Concept Formation using a Common Framework for Unsupervised and Supervised Learning,"A general learning rule, ``BCM-δ'', is proposed that subsumes both unsupervised learning as a form of the BCM rule (Bienenstock, Cooper, Munro, 1982; Munro, 1984) and the delta rule (Rosenblatt, 1958; Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, 1986). The ``BCM-δ'' unit is composed of two subunits, T and L, each integrating distinct input streams across distinct sets of synapses. The two subunits follow a common Hebb-like learning procedure that reduces to an unsupervised rule for the T subunit and a supervised rule for the L subunit in which the T response is the training signal. This model suggests a neurally plausible mechanism for the shaping of concepts by labels. More generally, stimuli from one modality can shape the response properties of a unit to another modality using a framework that is biologically plausible and gives clues to the source of a teaching signal for supervised learning.",>Paul Munro,>University of Pittsburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0697/index.html

However, there is only little work on the use of spiking neural networks in these fields. In this project, we developed a virtual environment to explore solving navigation tasks using spiking neural networks. We first used an existing experimental setup and compared the results to validate the developed environment. An evolutionary approach is used to set the parameters of a spiking neural network controlling a robot to navigate without collisions. In a second set of experiments, we trained the network via reinforcement learning which was implemented as a reward-based STDP protocol. Our results validate the correctness of the developed virtual environment and demonstrate the usefulness of using such a platform. The virtual environment guarantees the reproducibility of our experiments and can be easily adapted for future research.",>Mahmoud Akl>Florian Walter>Florian Röhrbein,>Technical University of Munich>Technical University of Munich>Technical University of Munich,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0698/index.html
2016,Why are we (un)systematic? the (empirical) costs and benefits of learning universal constructions,"A theoretical challenge for cognitive science is to explain both the presence and absence of systematicity. One explanation (Phillips & Wilson, 2010) says systematicity derives from universal constructions. We tested this theory with an experiment that required learning cue-target pair maps whose underlying structures were either products (universal construction), or non-products (control). Each series was learned in either ascending or descending order of size: number of unique cue/target elements constituting pairs, which varied from three to six. Only performance on the product series was affected by order: systematicity was obtained universally in the descend group, but only on large sets in the ascend group. The results suggest that learning small maps directly, without reference to the underlying product, may be perceived as more cost-effective, i.e., acquisition of a universal construction, hence systematicity, depends on an empirical cost-benefit tradeoff.",>Steven Phillips>Yuji Takeda>Fumie Sugimoto,">National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0699/index.html
2016,Reasoners are influenced by conversational pragmatics in abstract conditional reasoning tasks,"People demonstrate systematic logical failures when reasoning about conditional statements. In the Wason selection task, a test typically interpreted as a measure of abstract deductive reasoning, only about 10% of participants choose the cards prescribed by deductive logic. One possibility is that people are simply bad at hypothesis testing – biased toward confirming rather than falsifying abstract conditional rules. A second possibility, however, is that performance on the task is strongly influenced by pragmatic effects of linguistic interpretation. In three experiments, we find that manipulating the instructions to emphasize falsification and that changing the formulation of the rule to increase the pragmatic salience of the correct choices improves performance. These results arise because people do not merely decode the logical content of linguistic expressions. Rather they attempt to understand the communicative intentions of the individual who produced the expression even in abstract reasoning tasks.",>Paul Thibodeau>Daniel Grodner,>Oberlin College>Swarthmore College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0700/index.html
2016,A Brain-Based Feature Model of Adjective-Noun Composition,"Brain-based features of meaning (sensory-motor features: sound, color, manipulation, motion, and shape) are used to compare two popular models of adjective-noun semantic composition: element-wise vector addition and multiplication. A large literature (e.g. Fernandino et al., 2015) suggests that perceptual systems contain information that can be extracted using neural decoding (e.g. Anderson, Murphy & Poesio, 2014). Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, participants rated how much each of the words and phrases (made of all combinations of the selected adjectives and nouns) evoked the features. Both multiplication and addition surpass chance at matching the correct phrase, but addition outperformed multiplication (addition = 7.6/60, multiplication = 13.4/60). Addition allows the adjective to weight the important sensory-motor attributes for the noun. Based on these behavioral results, we predict, and will test in upcoming work, that addition will also be successful when using brain activity (from fMRI) as the representations of the adjectives, nouns, and phrases.",>Elizabeth A.

2016,"Is it Living? Insights from Modeling Event-Oriented, Self-Motivated, Acting, Learning and Conversing Game Agents","A cognitive architecture is presented, which combines insights from artificial intelligence with cognitive psychology, biology, and linguistics. Using a Super Mario clone, we equipped the simulated agents with (i) motivational behavioral systems, (ii) reasoning and planning capabilities, (iii) event-based schema learning and sensorimotor exploration, and (iv) speech comprehension and generation mechanisms. The motivational system activates goal events to maintain internal homeostasis. To invoke selected events, hierarchical action planning and control unfolds both on an event-schematic and a sensorimotor level. Schema learning is based on the detection of event changes, which are not predicted by the basic sensorimotor forward model. Language is comprehended and generated using context-free grammars linked to the schema-based knowledge structure.

It proposes a diachronic aspect of macro-event, an aspect that seems to be under-appreciated or even neglected. It argues that a macro-event integrates two simple events through grammaticalization. This hypothesis is supported by the behaviors of directional verbs in Mandarin Chinese in that these forms alone can express almost all five types of macro-events that Talmy analyzed, and that these macro-events themselves represent an integration of two simple events, and exhibit various degrees of grammaticalization.

This study examined aging effects on episodic memory recollections by analyzing free writing reports by older and young drivers. Unstructured hand-writing samples from 199 older (Mage = 69.2) long-experienced (Mdriving = 43.0 years), and 299 young (Mage = 21.5) novice (Mdriving = 2.2 years) drivers were avalyzed by Latent Dirichlet Allocation. This identified a 6-topic model labeled: (1) operational failures, (2) control aspects, (3) other vehicles, (4) jump-outs, (5) traffic lights, and (6) attention. Posterior distribution analysis revealed that older drivers reported less in topics concerning own driving operations. In addition, older drivers less attributed these topics to self than environment relative to young drivers.

Do faces that surround us in time also affect how attractive we seem? Participants rated the attractiveness of famous female faces presented in a sequence of three and in isolation. We found that people do integrate information about attractiveness over time, but that temporal context has the opposite effect of static context. People perceived faces as less attractive in a series than when those same faces were presented in isolation. We also varied the attractiveness of surrounding faces in order to examine how the serial position of contextual information figures into people’s judgments of a face. Faces presented early in the sequence figured more heavily into people’s judgments than did faces presented at the end.

Results showed that participants decided according to Bayesian calculations to stop information acquisition and decide. Moreover, information acquisition strategies seemed consistent with prospect theory, with participants weighing information pieces differently and seeking more or less information given different manipulations in scenario probability, consequence valence and intensity. EEG data suggests a lateralization at frontal electrode sites. With probabilities stated, low negative consequence scenarios showed a positive peak at F3 around 200 ms before a decision was made.

In the task, undergraduate and graduate students were asked to sort probability problems into groups by similarity of solution. The problems varied by relevant probability principle, by type of semantic schema, and by cover-story surface content. Results showed that both less-trained students and more-trained students tended to sort problems by relevant probability principle, but students with more statistics training did this more consistently. Both groups of students tended to be affected in the sorting task by semantic schema, defined here as intermediate-level abstractions of the problem structure. For example, when a permutation problem described assignment of people to people, students showed a strong tendency to group it with independent-events problems with a people-to-people matching schema.",>Chenmu Xing>James Corter>Doris Zahner,">Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA>Teachers College, Columbia University>Council for Aid to Education",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0710/index.html

However, it is unclear how words and pictures may be processed differently when they are actively ignored. Our earlier work demonstrated a facilitated recognition for actively ignored words, provided they appeared frequently with an attended target in a previously presented repetition detection task (Dewald, Sinnett, & Doumas, 2012). The current study adapted this paradigm to examine the extent to which unattended pictures may be processed under analogous conditions. Overall, ignored pictures were recognized more often than ignored words. Moreover, recognition for ignored pictures did not benefit from target-alignment whereas ignored words did. These findings suggest that unattended pictures may continue to be processed more readily than words even under conditions in which attention is not directed toward them.",>Scott Sinnett>Maegen Walker>Margeaux Ciraolo>Andrew Dewald,">University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA>University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA>University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA>University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0711/index.html
2016,Kindergarteners and adults learn fraction-rules in a categorization task,"Both children and adults can learn new categories when presented with a rule about a perceptual feature. Like categorization, numerical abstraction requires the ability to ignore irrelevant (non-numeric) perceptual features when making decisions about relevant (numeric) features. The present study fuses these two lines of research by training 5-7 year olds and adults in a categorization task, in which they must form a rule about a fraction-based category. Can children form this mathematical category readily? Will they be able to do so without any formal instruction? How does this ability develop or change across the lifespan? We find that young children and adults readily form fraction-based categories, indicating that children can think about proportional information prior to formal schooling. Additionally, an ability to map between visual and symbolic representations aided both children and adults in this numeric categorization task, with children showing additional gains in traditional fraction knowledge.",>Tasha Posid>Vladimir Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0712/index.html
2016,Promoting prosocial behavior and emotional awareness in preschoolers,"Human-animal interaction (HAI) supports a theory that animals may enhance social support both directly, as a source of comfort, and indirectly, as a facilitator of human interaction. Existing research found that dogs are suitable in helping children develop healthy self-esteem and empathy for others and the classroom interaction between assistance dogs and children is also effective in developing children’s sense of responsibility and empathy. The current study implemented dog-assisted interaction (DAI) and video interaction (VI) as two different experimental conditions to test their efficacies in promoting preschoolers’ prosocial behaviors and emotional awareness. A total of 146 Chinese children (aged from 3 to 5.5 years old) participated in the study. The results indicated that both DAI and VI are more effective in promoting collaborative behaviors than regular teaching method on their collaborative ability and emotional awareness while only DAI significantly enhanced children’s emotional awareness.",>Qiuwen Dou>Sarah-Jane Vick>Michael C.

2016,A Cognitive Approach to Modeling Sentence Level Prominence Based on Stimulus Unpredictability,"The human sensory system is capable to rapidly respond to novel input, allowing for quick allocation of attentional resources to the stimulus. In a similar manner, prominent words in speech seem to attract the listeners’ attention and facilitate or alter interpretation. Sentence prominence has been typically studied across languages by examining configurations of acoustic prosodic features during prominent words. Recent studies have provided evidence that, in addition to the predictability of the lexical units in speech, manipulating the predictability of the acoustic prosodic features can also signal prominence. In this work, we provide a high-level description of a cognitive framework that attempts to characterize sentence prominence as a phenomenon that is connected with the unpredictability of suprasegmental acoustic features, thereby capturing the attention of the listener and causing differential processing of prominent speech.",>Sofoklis Kakouros>Okko Räsänen,>Aalto University>Aalto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0714/index.html
2016,Simulating the cost of cooperation: A recipe for collaborative problem solving,"Crowdsourcing consists in engaging a community of people in solving complex problems. Collaborative problem solving is affected by many variables (e.g., group size, difficulty of the task, tendency to cooperate) in a complex way. In this study, we extend the results of Guazzini et al. (2015) by means of a numerical simulation exploring the impact of the cost of cooperation in collaborative problem solving. We observed that the cooperation costs have damaging effect with smaller groups that face hard problems. When groups fail to solve the problem there is a long-term reduction in fitness (since the group is not able to learn) as well as a short-term loss of a payoff. So, when facing small group and hard task in concrete application, it is better to control the cooperation costs with ad hoc interventions.",>Alessandro Lazzeri>Andrea Guazzini>Daniele Vilone>Giorgio Gronchi,>University of Pisa>University of Florence>CNR - Italy>University of Florence,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0715/index.html
2016,Choice magnitude and decision time: investigating magnitude sensitivity in value-based decision making,"From an evolutionary perspective, it has been proposed that decision making should be sensitive to the overall magnitude of the alternatives under consideration in order to resolve costly deadlocks and thus improve long-term reward intake. We provide initial evidence that the overall magnitude of the alternatives affects decision making, by speeding up decision time in order to maximise a speed-value trade off. Implications for current computational models of decision making, in particular for the Drift Diffusion Model, are discussed.",>Angelo Pirrone>Philip Pärnamets>James Marshall>Tom Stafford,">University of Sheffield, UK	>Lund University, Sweden>University of Sheffield, UK	>University of Sheffield, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0716/index.html
2016,Multimodal Object Recognition and Categorisation by Interactive Behaviours,"Human beings have an excellent ability which can form and recognise object categories. In this paper, a novel system of multimodal object recognition and categorisation by perform- ing interactive behaviours is introduced. Video clips are filmed as the raw input of the system. A dataset of 100 objects with 18 categories and 5 different interactions is used to evaluated the performance. Convolutional neural network is used to train the classifier and learn the categories. The result shows the high- est, lowest and average recognition accuracies of every specific object in every category and the receiver operating character- istic for every category. The connection between the presented system and human cognitive system is discussed in the conclu- sion and future works.",>Haojun Guan>Jianwei Zhang,">University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany>University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0717/index.html
2016,Preschoolers evaluate risk and reward in exploration-exploitation tasks,"Children are drivers of their own discovery. To develop a complete characterization of the factors that drive exploration in early childhood, we must first understand how competing factors influence children's decision making. We investigated preschool-aged children's decision-making on explore-exploit tasks where the available information about the distribution of rewards was controlled. When probability information is unknown, children preferred to exploit known rewards over exploring unknown ones. However, performance in Experiment 2 shows that children can use probabilistic information to form accurate expectations about possible outcomes to effectively choose between exploiting and exploring. The degree to which individual children are ``exploratory'' is also shown to be consistent over weeks, suggesting that individual children have ``trait-like'' exploratory drives. On aggregate, children incorporate these individual tendencies towards exploration or exploitation with probability information; thus children readily form estimations of expected reward and use this information to guide efficient exploratory behavior.",>Elizabeth Lapidow>Elizabeth Baraff Bonawitz,>Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0718/index.html
2016,Transfer at the Level of Human-Computer System: Problem Solving using Procedure-Automation Software,"Issues of transfer and of human-computer systems are central, but largely separate questions in cognitive science. We take the human-computer system as the unit of analysis and explore how well a human-computer system transfers to tasks outside the scope of the humans’ training and the software’s design. In two experiments, participants used the procedure automation software (PRIDE) to control simulations of International Space Station habitat systems. Both the software design and the user training addressed routine procedure execution. In the transfer problems the conditions assumed for routine procedure execution were not met, requiring novel problem solving. We report on our methods for complex behavior analysis and our results showing high though imperfect transfer, noteworthy given the widespread difficulty of transfer. Further investigation of transfer at the level of human-computer system is important for understanding what combinations of technology design and user experience enable effectively dealing with the unexpected.",>Dorrit Billman>Debra Schereckenghost>Zachary Caddick,>San Jose State University>TRACLabs>San Jose State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0719/index.html
2016,What Makes Campaign Messages Popular On Twitter ?,"The rapid adoption of social media by billions of people from all over the world has unleashed unprecedented opportunities for marketers and cognitive scientists to better understand why some message become popular while other die quickly. We designed a novel technique for automatically learning to differentiate popular tweets from unpopular ones and to predict how popular a given tweet will become in a given target audience. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we applied it to real world data collected from six social media messaging campaigns run by a variety of marketing as well as non-profit organizations including Proctor and Gamble’s Always Campaign. The studies showed that our approach can be highly effective (achieving accuracy scores from 92% to 99%) for automatically learning what makes a message popular in any given group as well as for automatically predicting how popular a message will be in a given target audience.",>M.

2016,Investigating the Explore/Exploit Trade-off in Adult Causal Inferences,"We explore how adults learn counterintuitive causal relationships, and whether they interpret evidence and discover hypotheses by incrementally revising beliefs. We examined how adults learned a novel, unusual causal rule when given data that initially appeared to follow a simpler, more salient rule. Adults watched a video of blocks placed sequentially on a detector that activated when a block was a ""blicket"", then were asked to determine the underlying causal structure. We contrasted two causal learning problems. In both cases, one rule could be used to determine which objects were blickets; in the first problem this rule was complex, but could be found by making incremental improvements to a simple and salient initial hypothesis. The second problem’s rule was simpler, but to adopt it, participants had to ignore initial beliefs. Our results provide some of the first evidence for an inference trade-off analogous to the ""explore-exploit"" trade-off in active learning.",>Erik Herbst>Christopher Lucas>Daphna Buchsbaum,">University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada>University of Edinburgh>University of Toronto, Toronto, ON",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/papers/0721/index.html

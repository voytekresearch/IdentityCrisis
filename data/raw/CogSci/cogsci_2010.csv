2010,Wild Systems Theory: Overcoming the Computational-Ecological Divide,"For years, there has been a tension between computationalist cognitive scientists who utilize the notion of representation and efficient-cause in their accounts of mind, and dynamical-systems oriented ecological psychologists who eschew representationalism and efficient-cause in favor of multi-scale, contingent interactions and embodiment. The present paper presents a recently-developed theory of embodiment, Wild Systems Theory (WST), that was developed to overcome this riff. WST conceptualizes organisms as multi-scale self-sustaining embodiments of the phylogenetic, cultural, social, and developmental contexts in which they emerged and in which they sustain themselves. Such self-sustaining embodiments of context are naturally and necessarily about the multi-scale contexts they embody. As a result, meaning (i.e., content) is constitutive of what they are. This approach to content overcomes the computationalist need for representation while simultaneously satisfying the ecological penchant for multi-scale contingent interactions.",>Jerome Scott Jordan,>Illinois State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0001/index.html
2010,Framing and Resource Activation: Bridging the Cognitive-Situative Divide Using a Dynamic Unit of Cognitive Analysis,"Theory in cognitive science often splits into those who treat cognition as occurring in individual minds those who treat it as situated or distributed, as irreducibly a matter of an individual-in-a-setting or of multiple individuals and artifacts. Prominent accounts have treated this split as between incommensurable paradigms (Sfard, 1998), competing theories (Greeno, 1997), and as complementary perspectives (Cobb, 1994). In the present paper, however, we argue that the accounts can be seen as theoretically continuous, differing in the scale of dynamics, such that a ""society of mind"" (Minsky, 1988) model of individual cognition is theoretically continuous with a ""mind of society"" model of social cognition. We sketch our framework and show how it leads to this continuity. We also argue that the relevant scale in any instance should be guided by the evidence, rather than based on purely a priori commitments.",>Luke Conlin>Ayush Gupta>David Hammer,">University of Maryland, College Park>University of Maryland, College Park>University of Maryland, College Park",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0002/index.html
2010,Modeling Personality and Individual Differences: The Approach-Avoid-Conflict Triad,"Personality is the unique patterning of affect, behavior, cognition and desires in individuals across time and situations. This patterning can occur on different information processing levels, specifically, the Reactive, Routine, and Reflective levels (Ortony et al., 2005), across these four domains. Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST; Gray & McNaughton, 2000) provides a biological account of the functional subdivision of the reactive level into the approach, avoidance, and conflict systems. These systems differ in their sensitivities to different classes of cues, giving rise to personality differences. But, individuals also differ at the routine and reflective levels in terms of how they respond (cognitively, affectively, behaviorally and motivationally) to approach situations, avoidance situations, and internal conflicts. In this paper, we discuss how the approach-avoidance-conflict (AAC) triad can be used as a broad framework for incorporating personality and individual differences into theories of human cognitive architectures. We also present work in progress on a computer implementation of the AAC triad at the reactive level.",>Karl Fua>William Revelle>Andrew Ortony,">(1) Northwestern University; (2) Computational Cognition for Social Systems, Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore>Northwestern University>(1) Northwestern University; (2) Computational Cognition for Social Systems, Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0003/index.html
2010,Understanding the Brain as an Endogenously Active Mechanism,"Although a reactive framework has long been dominant in cognitive science and neuroscience, an alternative framework emphasizing dynamics and endogenous activity has recently gained prominence. We review some of the evidence for endogenous activity and consider the implications not only for understanding cognition but also for accounts of explanation offered by philosophers of science. Our recent characterization of dynamic mechanistic explanation emphasizes the co-ordination of accounts of mechanisms that identify parts and operations with computational models of their activity. These can, and should, be extended to incorporate attention to mechanisms that are not only active, but endogenously active.",>William Bechtel>Adele Abrahamsen,>UCSD>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0004/index.html
2010,Likability-Based Genres: Analysis and Evaluation of the Netflix Dataset,"This paper describes a new approach to defining genre. A model is presented that defines genre based on likability ratings rather than features of the content itself. By collecting hundreds of thousands of likability ratings, and incorporating these into a topic model, one can create genre categories that are interesting and intuitively plausible. Moreover, we give evidence that likability-based features can be used to predict human annotated genre labels more successfully than content-based features for the same data. Implications for outstanding questions in genre theory are discussed.",>Andrew Olney,>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0005/index.html
2010,Constructing Typing-Time Corpora: A New Way to Answer Old Questions,"Many current studies in linguistics and psycholinguistics require the use of phonetically labeled speech data. Collecting and annotating such data is expensive and slow. An alternative approach makes use of pre-labeled speech corpora, but these are available for very few languages, might not contain the desired linguistic environment, and the construction of new ones is still expensive and time-consuming. We present a fast and cost-efficient method for constructing a new type of corpus which retains many of the advantages of phonetically labeled speech, typing-time corpora. In this paper we show that an English typing-time corpus collected over the web is sufficient to replicate word frequency and neighborhood density effects. We then demonstrate the transferability of this method to less studied languages and to different orthographies. We show that a smaller Hebrew typing corpus collected over the web can be used to find lengthening effects in infrequent Hebrew words.",>Uriel Cohen Priva,>Stanford,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0006/index.html
2010,Large-Scale Acquisition of Feature-Based Conceptual Representations from Textual Corpora,"Methods for estimating peoples conceptual knowledge have the potential to be very useful to theoretical research on conceptual semantics. Traditionally, feature-based conceptual representations have been estimated using property norm data; however, computational techniques have the potential to build such representations automatically. The automatic acquisition of feature-based conceptual representations from corpora is a challenging task, given the unconstrained nature of what can constitute a semantic feature. Existing computational methods typically do not target the full range of concept-relation-feature triples occurring in human generated norms (e.g. tiger have stripes) but rather focus on concept-feature tuples (e.g. tiger  stripes) or triples involving specific relations only. We investigate the large-scale extraction of concept-relation-feature triples and the usefulness of encyclopedic, syntactic and semantic information in guiding the extraction process. Our method extracts candidate triples (e.g. tiger have stripes, flute produce sound) from parsed corpus data and ranks them on the basis of semantic information. Our investigation shows the usefulness of external knowledge in guiding feature extraction and highlights issues of methodology and evaluation which need to be addressed in developing models for this task.",>Barry Devereux>Nicholas Pilkington>Thierry Poibeau>Anna Korhonen,>University of Cambridge>University of Cambridge>Laboratoire LaTTiCe-CNRS>University of Cambridge,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0007/index.html
2010,Are Random Representations Accurate Approximations of Lexical Semantics?,"A common assumption made by cognitive models is that lexical semantics can be approximated using randomly generated representations to stand in for word meaning. However, the use of random representations contains the hidden assumption that semantic similarity across randomly selected words is normally distributed. We evaluated this assumption by computing similarity distributions for randomly selected words from a number of well-know semantic measures and comparing them with the distributions from random representations commonly used in memory models.",>Brendan Johns>Michael Jones,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0008/index.html
2010,A Neural Model of Rule Generation in Inductive Reasoning,"Inductive reasoning is a fundamental and complex aspect of human intelligence. In particular, how do subjects, given a set of particular examples, generate general descriptions of the rules governing that set? We present a biologically plausible method of accomplishing this task, and implement it in a spiking neuron model. We demonstrate the success of this model by applying it to the problem domain of Ravens Progressive Matrices, a widely used tool in the field of intelligence testing. The model is able to generate the rules necessary to correctly solve Ravens items, as well as recreate many of the experimental effects observed in human subjects.",>Daniel Rasmussen>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0009/index.html
2010,The Effects of Domain and Type of Knowledge on Category-Based Inductive Reasoning,"Accounts of category-based inductive reasoning can be distinguished by the emphasis they place on structured versus unstructured knowledge. In addition, it has been claimed that certain domains of structured knowledge are more available than others. Using a speeded task paradigm, participants rated the strength of inductive arguments in which the categories were either strongly or weakly associated and shared a taxonomic or causal relation.. Strongly associated categories received higher inductive strength ratings than weakly associated category pairs, regardless of the domain by which the categories were related. Strength of association was highly predictive of inductive strength ratings, but more additional variance was accounted for by beliefs about taxonomic and causal relations when people were not under time pressure. This suggests that, regardless of knowledge domain, maximizing inductive potency relies on the use of both structured and unstructured knowledge, depending on available mental resources.",>Aimée Kay Crisp-Bright>Aidan  Feeney,">Durham University>Queen's University, Belfast",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0010/index.html
2010,Learning hypothesis spaces and dimensions through concept learning,"Generalizing a property from a set of objects to a new object is a fundamental problem faced by the human cognitive system, and a long-standing topic of investigation in psychology. Classic analyses suggest that the probability with which people generalize a property from one stimulus to another depends on the distance between those stimuli in psychological space. This raises the question of how people identify an appropriate metric for determining the distance between novel stimuli. In particular, how do people determine if two dimensions should be treated as separable, with distance measured along each dimension independently (as in an $L_1$ metric), or integral, supporting Euclidean distance (as in an $L_2$ metric)? We build on an existing Bayesian model of generalization to show that learning a metric can be formalized as a problem of learning a hypothesis space for generalization, and that both ideal and human learners can learn appropriate hypothesis spaces for a novel domain by learning concepts expressed in that domain.",>Joseph Austerweil>Thomas Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0011/index.html
2010,"The Role of ""Explaining Away"" in Human Abstract Rule Induction","Of great interest to cognitive science is how human learning is constrained to avoid spurious generalizations. While many constraints must be relatively experience-independent, past experience provides a rich source of guidance for subsequent learning. If a learner discovers some structure in part of the environment, this can inform her future hypotheses about that domain. If a general structure parsimoniously accounts for particular sub-patterns, a rational learner should not stipulate separate explanations for each detail without additional evidence, as the general structure has explained away the original evidence. In a grammar-learning experiment using tone sequences, manipulating learners prior exposure to a tone environment affects their sensitivity to the grammar-defining feature, in this case consecutive repeated tones. Grammar-learning performance is worse if context melodies are smooth, that is, if small intervals occur more often than large ones, as this smoothness is a general property that accounts for a high rate of repetition.",>Colin Dawson>LouAnn Gerken,>University of Arizona>University of Arizona,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0012/index.html
2010,An Analysis of the Working Memory Capacity Paradox,"In the literature on working memory (WM), a paradox exists according to which very similar memory tasks provide support for very different estimates of working memory capacity. The current paper analyses the conflicting estimates of a capacity of 4+/-1 with a capacity of 1. To this end a dynamic process model of short-term recognition is used to generate data to which exponential speed-accuracy trade-off functions are fitted. The results show that even though the process model has a capacity larger than one, the exponential SAT functions indicate a one-chunk hypothesis. Further nested modeling reveals, counter to the dominant belief, that retrieval rate is insensitive to differences in WM capacity. The resolution of the WM capacity paradox lies in the choice of dependent measure.",>Eddy J.

2010,Working Memory Load Affects Device-Specific but Not Task-Specific Error Rates,"Human error in routine procedural tasks is often attributed to momentary failures to remember what step to perform. We argue that task-specific steps, which can be defined as actions required to achieve a particular goal across a variety of different devices, are far less prone to error than device-specific steps, which can be defined as actions that are required for the operation of the device but do not directly contribute to the goal. An experiment is reported that supports this distinction, showing that device-specific steps are more error prone than task-specific steps. Moreover, we argue that these errors reflect a failure of memory because the error rate for device-specific steps was sensitive to increased working memory load, while the error rate for task-specific steps was not. The current work demonstrates that a distinction between device- and task-specific steps can be effective in explaining error patterns observed on a specific task.",>Maartje Ament>Anna Cox>Ann Blandford>Duncan Brumby,>University College London>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0014/index.html
2010,An examination of the ERP correlates of recognition memory using state-trace analysis.,"There has been much debate in recent years as to whether recognition memory is best described using a single or dual process model. State-trace analysis provides an atheoretical approach to determining the number of underlying psychological variables, or processes, that mediate the effect of one or more independent variables on the measured dependent variables. Recently, state-trace analysis has shown strong support for a single process interpretation of the behavioral results from recognition memory experiments. In this paper, we demonstrate, using state-trace analysis, that both the behavioral and electrophysiological results from recognition memory experiments are also supportive of a single process interpretation.",>Emily Freeman>Simon Dennis>John Dunn,>The University of Newcastle>The Ohio State University>The University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0015/index.html
2010,Modeling Change in Recognition Bias with the Progression of Alzheimers,"One of the key memory tests in the clinical assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimers Disease (AD) is the recognition memory task. Models developed in cognitive psychology have previously been applied to help understand clinical data. In particular, Signal Detection Theory (SDT) models have been used, to separate peoples memory capabilities from their decision-making strategies. An important finding in this literature is that people with AD change their decision strategy in response to memory impairment, applying a more liberal criterion than people without AD. In this paper, we analyze clinical data that measures the progression of AD in a detailed way, using a theoretically motivated version of SDT, and applying hierarchical Bayesian methods to model individual differences. Our results corroborate many of the previous findings, but provide a more detailed focus on recognition performance with AD progression.",>James Pooley>Michael Lee>William Shankle,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine>Medical Care Corporation",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0016/index.html
2010,"Context, Syntactic Priming, and Referential Form in an Interactive Dialogue Task: Implications for Models of Alignment","Two experiments examined how context and syntactic priming interact to determine interlocutors choice of referential form. Pairs of naïve participants took turns producing descriptions of target pictures from a set of alternatives. The first experiment established that a contrast picture in the display (e.g. a striped cat in a display where a spotted cat was the target) primarily determined whether an adjective was used. Priming with an adjective had a only small, secondary effect on adjective use. However, when an adjective was used, it was more likely to occur in the prime-congruent structure than the alternative structure. Experiment 2 compared the effects of a prime produced by the dialogue partner with the effects of a pre-recorded prime played through headphones. Syntactic priming was significant only for the dialogue prime trials, indicating that priming may be stronger in dialogue than outside of dialogue, as previous work has suggested. However, even in dialogue, the primary factor that determined referential form was the set of alternatives. Our results begin to clarify the role of syntactic priming in dialogue, suggesting that it has at most a small effect on message formulation.",>Kathleen Carbary>Ellen Frohning>Michael Tanenhaus,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0017/index.html
2010,Converging Hands or Converging Minds?,"Interlocutors sometimes repeat each others representational hand gestures. We investigated if this is a case of direct mimicry of form, or whether perceiving a gesture gives rise to a semantic representation, which subsequently informs gesture production. For this we used an interactive route description task, in which a confederates gestures indicated the route in either the vertical or the horizontal plane and either with one or four fingers extended as an index. We found that perceiving vertical gestures led to an increase not only in participants production of vertical gestures, but also in their use of one finger as an index, suggesting that seeing vertical gestures caused participants to think of the route as on a map, which led them to point with one finger (as is common on a map) rather than four. Our results support the notion that repetition of meaningful gesture forms results from converging semantic representations.",>Lisette Mol>Emiel  Krahmer>Alfons Maes>Marc Swerts,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0018/index.html
2010,Vocal Interaction Dynamics of Children With and Without Autism,"This study examines the temporal and directional characteristics of child-adult vocal exchanges in day-long naturalistic recordings of autism and typical control groups. In both populations, adults responded frequently (on average about 40% of responses) within 1s or less, a time thought to be conducive for contingency learning by the child. However, the time to adult response tended to be longer for the autism population. In the autism group, children also tended to follow more and lead less relative to the control group, as measured by differences in diagonal recurrence profiles computed based on cross recurrence plots. The results inform on the dynamics of naturalistic communicative interaction in normal development and therefore on the social context in which language develops. They also illustrate how large datasets and modern interaction analyses can expand our understanding of differences in children with autism, a population with both social and language deficits.",>Anne S.

2010,Virtually accommodating: Speech rate accommodation to a virtual interlocutor.,"Why do people accommodate to each others linguistic behavior? Studies of natural interactions (Giles, Taylor & Bourhis, 1973) suggest that speakers accommodate to achieve interactional goals, influencing what their interlocutor thinks or feels about them. But is this the only reason speakers accommodate? In real-world conversations, interactional motivations are ubiquitous, making it difficult to assess the extent to which they drive accommodation. Do speakers still accommodate even when interactional goals cannot be achieved, for instance, when their interlocutor cannot interpret their accommodation behavior? To find out, we asked participants to enter an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment and to converse with a virtual interlocutor. Participants accommodated to the speech rate of their virtual interlocutor even though he could not interpret their linguistic behavior, and thus accommodation could not possibly help them to achieve interactional goals. Results show that accommodation does not require explicit interactional goals, and suggest other social motivations for accommodation.",>Laura Staum Casasanto>Kyle Jasmin>Daniel Casasanto,>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0020/index.html
2010,Connecting the Visible to the Invisible: Helping Middle School Students Understand Complex Ecosystem Processes.,"Learning about ecosystems is challenging because, like any complex system, they are simultaneously multidimensional and dynamic. Often, learners engage only with the visible components of an ecosystem and draw either single or linear causal connections between components. In this study, we explored how using a Structure-Behavior-Function framework supported middle school students conceptual and complex reasoning about the visible and invisible components of an ecosystem. Research shows that learners often engage only with the visible components of an ecosystem and draw linear/single causal connections between the components of the ecosystem. Our findings suggest that a combination of using structure, behavior, and function approach along with a set of carefully designed technology tools can push the students toward a better understanding of the ecosystem functioning. The results show that along with the visible components of the ecosystem, students have started to identify the invisible components of the ecosystem.",>Sameer Honwad>Cindy Hmelo-Silver>Rebecca Jordan>Catherine  Eberbach>Steven  Gray>Suparna  Sinha>Ashok  Goel>Swaroop  Vattam>Spencer  Rugaber>David  Joyner,>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0021/index.html
2010,Response Times and Misconception-like Responses to Science Questions,"Patterns of incorrect answering or misconception-like responses to scientific concept questions have been well documented. Here we investigate both response choices and response times to gain insight into the nature of misconception-like responses. In a series of experiments involving questions on graphs in which participants must compare the slopes of two points, we find that students answering with misconception-like responses, namely comparing heights rather than the slopes, do so consistently and more rapidly than those answering correctly. We also find in a speeded experiment, that all students are able to compare slopes and heights, but comparing heights requires less time than comparing slopes. Finally, by imposing a delay in responding that is long enough for the responder to process both slopes and heights, we find a reduction in misconception-like responses. Thus the misconception-like responses can be explained in terms of speed-accuracy trade-off models in which responders place high priority on answering quickly.",>Andrew Heckler>Thomas Scaife>Eleanor Sayre,>Ohio State University>Ohio State University>Wabash College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0022/index.html
2010,Effects of Problem Context on Strategy Use within Functional Thinking,"The effect of problem format on problem solving strategy selection is investigated within the early algebra domain of functional thinking. Functional Thinking is a type of algebraic reasoning appropriate for elementary students, in which a relationship exists between two sets of values. Three function table problems were given to students in grades two through six (N=232) in three different problem contexts. Problem context affected student strategy selection. Presenting the problem with non-indexical X values elicited the most correct strategy use, whereas the format with indexical X values elicited the most naïve and incorrect strategy use. Presenting the problem in a story context did not help correct strategy selection, but it decreased incorrect strategy use. Findings highlight factors influencing strategy selection, and have implication for instructional design and problem solving.",>Katherine McEldoon>Caroline Cochrane-Braswell >Bethany Rittle-Johnson,>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0023/index.html
2010,The Application of the Less is More Hypothesis in Foreign Language Learning,"The goal of this study was to test a foreign language teaching method inspired by Newport (1990)s Less is More hypothesis. Computerized French language lessons were presented to 112 adults over two one-hour sessions. Learning trials were presented either in full sentences to resemble the adult learning environment, or in small phrases that incrementally increased in length to full sentences, resembling the steadily expanding processing capabilities of children. Trials were also ordered randomly or blocked such that multiple examples of the same objects and verbs were presented consecutively, in order to promote attention to individual words within those sentences. Language proficiency tests of vocabulary and grammar were administered after the lessons. The incremental and blocked conditions outperformed the randomly ordered full sentence conditions on the grammar measure. This outcome suggests that a teaching method based on Newports Less is More hypothesis can be advantageous in learning a foreign language.",>Simone Chin>Alan Kersten,>Florida Atlantic University>Florida Atlantic University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0024/index.html
2010,Are People Successful at Learning Sequential Decisions on a Perceptual Matching Task?,"Sequential decision-making tasks are commonplace in our everyday lives. We report the results of an experiment in which human subjects were trained to perform a perceptual matching task, an instance of a sequential decision-making task. We use two benchmarks to evaluate the quality of subjects' learning. One benchmark is based on optimal performance as defined by a dynamic programming procedure. The other is based on an adaptive computational agent that uses a reinforcement learning method known as Q-learning to learn to perform the task. Our analyses suggest that subjects learned to perform the perceptual matching task in a near-optimal manner at the end of training. Subjects were able to achieve near-optimal performance because they learned, at least partially, the causal structure underlying the task. Subjects' learning curves were broadly consistent with those of model-based reinforcement-learning agents that built and used internal models of how their actions influenced the external environment. We hypothesize that, in general, people will achieve near-optimal performances on sequential decision-making tasks when they can detect the effects of their actions on the environment, and when they can represent and reason about these effects using an internal mental model.",>Reiko Yakushijin>Robert Jacobs,>Aoyama Gakuin University>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0025/index.html
2010,The Impact of Perceptual Aliasing on Exploration and Learning in a Dynamic Decision Making Task,"Perceptual aliasing arises in situations where multiple, distinct states of the world give rise to the same percept. In this study, we examine how the degree of perceptual aliasing in a task impacts the ability of human agents to learn reward-maximizing decision strategies. Previous work has shown that the presence of perceptual cues that help signal distinct states of the environment can improve the ability of learners to adopt an optimal decision strategy in sequential decision making tasks (Gureckis & Love, 2009). In our experiments, we parametrically manipulated the degree of perceptual aliasing afforded by certain perceptual cues in a similar task. Our empirical results and simulations show how the ability of the learner improves as relevant states in the world uniquely map to differentiated percepts. The results provide further support for the model of sequential decision making proposed by Gureckis & Love (2009) and highlight the important role that state representations may have on behavior in dynamic decision making and learning tasks.",>Lisa Zaval>Todd Gureckis,>Columbia University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0026/index.html
2010,Human foraging behavior: A virtual reality investigation on area restricted search in humans,"The control of attention and the control of movement in space share a similar optimal control structuremediating the trade-off between exploiting one locale and exploring others. A common spatial foraging strategy observed in many species is area-restricted search, in which animals respond to resources or their absence by moving between local and global search strategies, respectively. When resources are clustered, area-restricted search can represent an optimal foraging strategy. Surprisingly few studies have investigated whether humans display such behavior in the context of spatial navigation. Here we present two experiments in which human participants search for resources distributed over a large virtual environment. By systematically manipulating the specific distribution of the resources the first experiment investigates humans ability to perform area-restricted search. The second experiment probes for the patch-leaving rules humans apply when facing resources distributed in patches that differ in quality. Our results indicate that humans forage in space using an area-restricted search, but do so in a non-optimal wayconsistent with other studies showing non-optimal search strategies in memory.",>Christopher Kalff>Thomas Hills>Jan Malte Wiener,">Center for Cognitive Science, Freiburg University>Department of Psychology, University of Basel>Department of Psychology, Bournemouth University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0027/index.html
2010,Learning in Multiple-cue Judgment Tasks,"In our daily lives we often make quantitative judgments based on multiple pieces of information such as evaluating a students paper based on form and content. Psychological research suggests that humans rely on several strategies to make multiple-cue judgments. The strategy that is used depends on the structure of the task. In contrast, recent research on learning in judgment tasks suggests that learning is relatively independent of task structure. In a simulation study we investigated how the performance of several learning models is influenced by the structure of the task and the amount of learning experience. We found that a linear additive neuronal network model performed well regardless of task structure and amount of learning. However, with little learning a heuristic model performed similarly well, and with extensive learning, associative learning models caught up with the linear additive model.",>Bettina von Helversen>Joerg Rieskamp,>Universität Basel>Universität Basel,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0028/index.html

Petrashek and Friedman present the most direct behavioral evidence to date for inhibitory processing in successful behavior prediction based on false belief and avoidance desire in preschoolers and young children. Goodman presents evidence from adults for a probabilistic modeling approach to theory of mind and social learning development, and extends the discussion to pragmatic language usage and natural pedagogy.

I provide a sketch of how we might understand de-conceptualised representation and I show that, on this new approach, many of the old problems, e.g. grounding, disappear.",>Nancy Salay,>Queen's University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0030/index.html

If the argument is successful it shows that cognitive science cannot explain intelligent linguistic behavior by explaining what thinking is.

Yet, the difference between the two types of cognitive capacities has rarely been made in a principled manner. Moreover, some of the examples that are put forward to illustrate it in the literature are either spurious or misleading. In this paper, I use a number of examples to determine what domain specificity is, and just as importantly, what it is not. A domain-specific cognitive system is one that is in principle generalizable, but which the cognizer does not extend to cases that the system did not originally evolve to deal with.",>Muhammad Ali Khalidi,>York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0032/index.html

2010,The avoidance of ambiguity during conversation: More than mere priming or mimicry?,"Interlocutors often omit important words during conversation, which can lead to miscommunication during ambiguous scenarios (Rayner, Carlson, & Frasyer, 1983). Haywood, Pickering and Branigan (2004) show that under ambiguous situations, listeners are highly sensitive to syntactic primes. The studies reported here evaluated the effects of linguistic and nonlinguistic cues to ambiguity. Experiment 1 implemented a syntactic prime and a visual mistake from a pseudo-confederate to promote disambiguation. Participants were successfully primed to disambiguate their statements during the pseudo-conversation but the visual mistake had no effect. Experiment 2 evaluated the effect of the visual mistake in the absence of a prime during an ambiguous pseudo-conversation. There was a significant effect of visual mistake for participants who believed they were speaking with a real person. Overall, participants did not merely mimic their pseudo-conversation partners syntactic prime, but perceived other cues to the breakdown in communication to better clarify their own statements.",>Jennifer M.

2010,Syntax Drives Phonological Choice - Even Independently of Word Choice,"We report the results of three experiments designed to test priming percolation (alignment boost effects) from one grammatical level to another. In the first two experiments, we set off to replicate in Dutch the results of Branigan, Pickering & Cleland (2000) for lexical boosts of syntactic alignment, adding a baseline control condition without priming. In the third experiment, we tested direct syntactic boosts of phonological alignment, using invented verbs. The direct link between syntax and phonology (without any interference from the lexicon) has been postulated in the past, but so far no empirical evidence has been offered in its favor. Our experimental results so far largely confirm the predictions of the Alignment Model (Pickering & Garrod, 2004), including the relation between syntax and phonology. Speakers, who were instructed to use the same syntactic structure as their dialogue partner did, also invented a verb that resembled more their partners invented verb.",>Marie Nilsenova>Marije van Amelsvoort,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0035/index.html
2010,Corpus Evidence for Age Effects on Priming in Child Language,"Structural priming, the tendency to repeat previously uttered syntactic structures, can give insight into human language processing and acquisition. We report two corpus-based studies of children's structural priming that test the following claim of the item-based account of language acquisition: as older children generalize over structures, priming increases with age. A hypothesis derived from this claim, viz., that the lexical boost effect decreases with age, is also tested. We fit mixed-effects logistic regression models on data from children aged 2 to 7.5 years from the CHILDES corpus. We demonstrate structural priming of arbitrary syntactic structures for the first time in child language data. We also find evidence that priming increases with age, but fail to confirm the hypothesis that the lexical boost effect decreases with age.",>Jeffrey Gerard>Frank Keller>Themis Palpanas,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Trento,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0036/index.html
2010,Understanding acceptability judgments: Additivity and working memory effects,"Linguists build theories of grammar based largely on acceptability contrasts. But these contrasts can reflect grammatical constraints and/or constraints on language processing. How can theorists determine the extent to which the acceptability of an utterance depends on functional constraints? In a series of acceptability experiments, we consider two factors that might indicate processing contributions to acceptability contrasts: (1) the way constraints combine (i.e., additively or super-additively), and (2) the way a comprehender's working memory resources influence acceptability judgments. Results suggest that multiple sources of processing difficulty combine to produce super-additive effects, but multiple grammatical violations do not. Furthermore, when acceptability judgments improve with higher working memory scores, this appears to be due to functional constraints. We conclude that tests of (super)-additivity and of differences in working memory can help to identify the effects of processing difficulty (due to functional constraints).",>Laura Staum Casasanto>Philip Hofmeister>Ivan Sag,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>University of California, San Diego>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0037/index.html

The current study addressed this question by examining the effect of labels on young children's classification and induction. The first experiment replicated previous study on adults demonstrating that adults treat labels as category markers. The other two experiments applied the same paradigm to young children. Children were trained by classification in Experiment 2A and by induction in Experiment 2B, whereas both experiments used the classification and induction tasks that were identical to those in Experiment 1. The results from the three experiments indicated that adults treated labels as category markers, whereas no such evidence was found for young children.",>Sophia Deng>Vladimir Sloutsky,>Ohio State University>Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0038/index.html
2010,The Price is Right: A High Information Access Cost Facilitates Category Learning,"Previous work in object categorization has shown that people tend to optimize their allocation of attention to object features, and suggests that attentional optimization may best be explained in terms of cost-benefit tradeoffs. In support of this idea, we found that implementing a cost for accessing information about object features in a category learning task facilitates both attentional optimization and category acquisition, contrary to the predictions of existing models.",>Michael Wood>Michael Fry>Mark Blair,">Simon Fraser University, University of Kent>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0039/index.html
2010,Effects of generative and discriminative learning on use of category variability,"Models of category learning can take two different approaches to representing the relationship between objects and categories. The generative approach solves the categorization problem by building a probabilistic model of each category and using Bayes' rule to infer category labels. In contrast, the discriminative approach directly learns a mapping between inputs and category labels. With this distinction in mind, we revisit a previously studied categorization experiment that showed people are biased towards categorizing objects into a category with higher variability. Modelling results predict that generative learners should be more greatly affected by category variability than discriminative learners. We show that humans can be prompted to adopt either a generative or discriminative approach to learning the same input, resulting in the predicted effect on use of category variability.",>Anne Hsu>Thomas  Griffiths,">University College London,, University of California Berkeley>University of California Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0040/index.html
2010,Category Learning Through Active Sampling,"Laboratory studies of human category learning tend to emphasize passive learning by limiting participants control over what information they experience on every trial. In this paper, we explore the impact that active data selection has on category learning. In our experiment, participants attempted to learn standard rule-based (RB) and information-integration (II) categories under either entirely passive conditions, or by actively selecting and querying the labels associated with particular stimuli. We found that participants generally acquired categories faster in the active learning condition. Furthermore, this advantage depended on learners actually making the decisions about which stimuli to query themselves. The effectiveness of active sampling was modulated, however, by the particular structure of the target category. Model based analyses explain these effects in terms of a strong bias towards uni- dimensional rules which impairs learning of the II category. Active learners appear to be able to bootstrap their own learning, but this ability may be strongly constrained by the space of hypotheses that are under consideration.",>Doug Markant>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0041/index.html
2010,SARKAE - Modeling the Co-Evolution of Event Memory and Knowledge,"We present an overview of a model for the co-evolution of knowledge and event memory. The model, termed SARKAE (Storing and Retrieving Knowledge and Events), describes the development of knowledge and event memories as an interactive process: knowledge is formed through the accrual of individual events, and the storage of an individual episode is dependent on prior knowledge. We reference two experiments which provide data to inform our theory: these studies involve the development of new knowledge, and then testing in transfer tasks involving episodic memory, retrieval from knowledge, and perception. The results of the transfer tasks indicate a substantial role of pure frequency or raw exposure, in opposition to the contextual diversity accounts of frequency suggested by Adelman et al (2006). An overview of the SARKAE model is presented. The model is able to account for the effects of frequency in the absence of contextual diversity.",>Angela Nelson>Richard Shiffrin,">University of California, San Diego>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0042/index.html

We demonstrate a novel process-tracing method that uses the looking-at-nothing phenomenon to study memory search and cue processing via eye tracking. Participants learned cue information of decision alternatives in spatial frames and later were presented with emptied displays of two alternatives in binary choice trials. With freely chosen and with instructed decision strategies, fixation patterns on former cue locations were in line with memory search and cue processing as postulated for lexicographic and compensatory strategies.",>Frank Renkewitz>Georg Jahn,>University of Erfurt>University of Greifswald,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0043/index.html
2010,Motor Simulation in a Memory Task: Evidence from Rock Climbing,"This study concerns the role of motor simulations in a memory task performed by expert and novice climbers. In a behavioural task, expert and novice rock climbers were shown three novel climbing routes: an easy route, a route impossible to climb but perceptually salient, and a difficult route. After a distraction task, they were given a recall test in which they had to write down the sequence of holds composing each route. No difference emerged between experts and novices on the easy and impossible routes. Differently, the performance of expert climbers was better than that of novices on the difficult route. Results suggest that seeing a climbing wall activates a motor, embodied simulation, which relies not on perceptual salience, but on motor competence. Crucially, it is shown that the ability to form this simulation is modulated by individuals motor repertoire and expertise, and that this strongly impacts recall.",>Giovanni Pezzulo>Laura Barca>Alessandro Lamberti Bocconi>Anna M.

2010,Enactive Social Cognition,"In this talk, I extend the enactive approach to cognition to the social domain within a larger framework of varieties of intentionality and argue for a second-person approach to understanding others, emphasizing a difference in our understanding of others depending on whether we are directly engaged with them in interaction or merely observing them. The enactive account is especially persuasive in developmental respects, suggesting that sophisticated forms of cognitive intentionality (e.g. believing) are grounded in motor intentionality (e.g. perception and action): Our own sensorimotor skills are partly constitutive of cognition, and other peoples expressions of their sensorimotor skills in turn modulate our cognition of objects and our social understanding. The enactive account explains how young infants acquire the capacities that allow them to move from dyadic to triadic intentional relations at around their first birthday, and it claims that our basic form of social understanding is neither based on theoretical inference nor a kind of simulation, but constituted by an embodied implicit know-how displayed in online interaction.",>Tobias Schlicht,>Centre for Integrative Neuroscience,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0045/index.html

However, observational data are expensive, laborious, and reliant on fallible human coders. We model interactions between caregivers and infants using a three dimensional simulation environment in order to gain greater insight into the development of infant attention sharing, specifically gaze following. Most models of infant cognition have been only abstractly linked to the detail of a real life environment and to the perception-and-action physicality of human infants. Our simulation uses human data from videotaped infant/caregiver interactions and a rich 3D environment to model the development of gaze following.

An experimental task investigated how infants modify gaze following behaviors when an adults line of sight is obstructed by a barrier. From 14 to 18 months, infants gradually learned to modify their search behavior when an adult looked toward a referent hidden behind a barrier from the infants perspective. This suggests development of perspective-taking during this period. It also reveals age-related changes in infants understanding of contextual effects on others referential gaze in visually complex environments. Furthermore, the results address debates about rich versus lean theories of shared attention and intentionality.",>R. Joanne Jao>Marybel Robledo>Gedeon O.

If lone participants believed that an unseen other person was also looking at the images they saw, it shifted the balance of their gaze between negative and positive images. The direction of this shift depended upon whether participants thought that later they would be compared against the other person or would be collaborating with them. Here we examined whether the joint perception is caused by beliefs about shared experience (looking at the same images) or beliefs about joint action (being engaged in the same task with the images). We place our results in the context of the emerging field of joint action, and discuss their connection to notions of group emotion and situated cognition. Such findings reveal the persuasive and subtle effect of social context upon cognitive and perceptual processes.",>Daniel Richardson>Chris Street>Joanne Tan,>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0048/index.html

This study investigated the use of video-based modeling examples to teach self-assessment and task-selection skills. Students in both the experimental and control condition observed the model performing a problem solving task; students in the experimental condition additionally observed the model engaging in self-assessment and task selection. Results show that students in both conditions acquired problem-solving skills from the examples, as indicated by a substantial pretest to posttest knowledge gain.

Upon what kind of epistemic foundations do such beliefs rest? The present study explored this question by comparing students scientific beliefs to their supernatural beliefs along four dimensions of epistemic import: confidence, perceived consensus, means of justification, and openness to revision. Participants scientific beliefs were strongly differentiated from their supernatural beliefs along the dimensions of confidence and consensus but only weakly differentiated along the dimensions of justification and revision. Moreover, participants confidence in both types of beliefs was predicted by their consensus estimates but not their ability to cite evidence in support of, or potentially in conflict with, those beliefs. These findings imply that students scientific beliefs are no more epistemologically sound than their supernatural beliefs, despite self perceptions to the contrary.",>Andrew Shtulman,>Occidental College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0050/index.html

Participants completed a multiple choice pretest, a learning session, a posttest, and a battery of individual differences tests and questionnaires. Multiple regression and exploratory factor analyses indicated that the individual differences measures yielded medium sized effects at predicting learning gains as well as engagement levels that were self-reported during the tutorial session. In general, self-reported interest in the task and confidence in learning from a computer tutor coupled with working memory capacity and attentional abilities were the major predictors of both engagement and learning.",>Sidney D'Mello>Claire  Williams>Patrick Hays>Andrew Olney,>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0051/index.html

However, it is a completely open question which characteristics of tutors might affect their assessment. In an empirical study with N = 22 tutor-tutee dyads, we used a methodology developed by Chi, Siler, and Jeong (2004) to examine the influence of the tutors content knowledge and beliefs about learning on their assessment accuracy. Results replicated previous research in showing that tutors overestimated a tutees correct understanding and underestimated a tutees incorrect understanding. In addition, more accurate assessments were positively related with tutees learning. Finally, content knowledge had a positive impact on assessment accuracy, whereas beliefs about learning were not strongly associated with assessment accuracy. Thus, assessing a tutees understanding seems to be important for the effectiveness of human tutoring. Moreover, the results suggest that the tutors assessment accuracy is largely influenced by their content knowledge.",>Stephanie Herppich>Jörg Wittwer>Matthias Nückles>Alexander Renkl,>Institute for Science and Mathematics Education at the University of Kiel>Institute for Science and Mathematics Education at the University of Kiel>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0052/index.html

Three major views concerning the psychological constructs that underlie risk attitude are contrasted. The first is the classical economic approach which views risk as the sensitivity to differences in variance. The second is the latent components approach suggesting the importance of sensitivity to losses and diminishing sensitivity to marginal increases in payoffs. The third approach, risk acceptance, relates to the willingness to accept probable outcomes over certainty. The results of three studies indicate that: (1) Individuals do not exhibit consistency in their sensitivity to variance (2) Across domains individuals are consistent when deciding between constant versus probable outcomes, refuting the prediction based on diminishing sensitivity. (3) Risk acceptance entails different psychological constructs when the decision involves co-occurring gains and losses.

Findings suggest a response procedure that utilizes multiple levels of processing. Amount of task exposure as well as the distance to the goal both affect the rate at which assessments are made, with task exposure decreasing assessment rate, while target distance increases assessment rate.

2010,Testing Two Explanations for the Disjunction Effect in Prisoner's Dilemma Games: Complexity and Quasi-Magical Thinking,"The paper explores the disjunction effect in the Prisoners dilemma game using behavioral experiments with eye-movement recordings. An experiment was designed to explore the complexity hypothesis about the appearance of the disjunction effect. The results show that in games with payoffs which are simpler to perceive and compare, the disjunction effect disappears, while it is present when more complex payoffs are used. In a second experiment, the participants were told that the moves of the computer opponent had been made before the game session. This manipulation led again to the disappearance of the disjunction effect even. We interpret this result as a suppressing of a possible quasi-magic reasoning by stressing the fact that participants own moves cannot influence the move of the opponent. The results from the experiments point to information processing complexity as a major factor for the disjunction effect contrary to the conclusions in some previous research.",>Evgenia Hristova>Maurice Grinberg,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0055/index.html

We try to question this assumption in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game by using a methodology which we call the subtractive behavioral method. Our aim is to investigate which task features make participants attend to the opponent's behavior or, on the contrary, make them take into account only their own choices and received payoffs.

We develop a computational version of this idea and explore whether the primitives typically proposed are sufficient to account for the meanings of spatial terms across languages. We compare a model where spatial terms correspond directly to primitives with models that represent spatial terms as discrete or weighted combinations of primitives.

To test this hypothesis, the World Color Survey (WCS) collected color naming data from 110 non-industrial societies, identifying regularities in the structure of languages with different numbers of terms. This leaves us with the question of where these universals come from. We use a simple model of cultural evolution known as ``iterated learning'' to explore the hypothesis that universals emerge from human perceptual and learning biases. We conducted an experiment simulating the process of cultural transmission in the laboratory, and compared the results to the systems of color terms that appear in the WCS data. Our results show that cultural evolution results in convergence of systems of color terms towards a form consistent with the WCS, supporting the hypothesis that universals are the result of perceptual and learning biases.",>Jing Xu>Thomas Griffiths>Mike Dowman,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>ImageScope",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0059/index.html
2010,Similarity judgments reflect both language and cross-language tendencies: Evidence from two semantic domains,"Many theories hold that semantic variation in the worlds languages can be explained in terms of a universal conceptual space that is partitioned differently by different languages. Recent work has supported this view in the semantic domain of containers (Malt et al., 1999), and assumed it in the domain of spatial relations (Khetarpal et al., 2009), based in both cases on similarity judgments derived from pile-sorting of stimuli. Here, we reanalyze data from these two studies and find a more complex picture than these earlier studies suggested. In both cases we find that sorting is similar across speakers of different languages (in line with the earlier studies), but nonetheless reflects the sorters native language (in contrast with the earlier studies). We conclude that there are cross-culturally shared conceptual tendencies that can be revealed by pile-sorting, but that these tendencies may be modulated to some extent by language. We discuss the implications of these findings for accounts of semantic variation.",>Naveen Khetarpal>Asifa Majid>Barbara Malt>Steven Sloman>Terry Regier,">University of Chicago>Max-Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Lehigh University>Brown University>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0060/index.html
2010,Adults' self-directed learning of an artificial lexicon: The dynamics of neighborhood reorganization,"Artificial lexicons have previously been used to examine the time course of the learning and recognition of spoken words, the role of segment type in word learning, and the integration of context during spoken word recognition. However, in all of these studies the experimenter determined the frequency and order of the words to be learned. Here we ask whether adult learners choose, either implicitly or explicitly, to listen to novel words in a particular order based on their acoustic similarity. We use a new paradigm for learning an artificial lexicon in which the learner, rather than the experimenter, determines the order and frequency of exposure to items. We analyze both the temporal clustering of subjects' sampling of lexical neighborhoods during training as well as their performance during repeated testing phases (accuracy and reaction time) to determine the time course of learning these neighborhoods. Subjects sampled the high and low density neighborhoods randomly in early learning, and then over-sampled the high density neighborhood until test performance on both neighborhoods reached asymptote. These results provide a new window on the time-course of learning an artificial lexicon and the role that learners implicit preferences play in learning highly confusable words.",>Neil Bardhan>Richard Aslin>Michael Tanenhaus,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0061/index.html
2010,Perceptual Advantage from Generalized Linguistic Knowledge,"We address the question of how previously acquired linguistic knowledge facilitates perception and learning of a new language. We report results from two experiments showing evidence that participants better discriminate a segmental duration contrast in a novel language if they had some previous exposure to a language that uses duration contrastively. Crucially, the perceptual advantage occurs even when the novel language employs the contrast in entirely different conditions: in novel segmental contexts and for novel segments, including a change from application to vowels to application to consonants. We take these results to suggest that language learners use their knowledge of previously learned languages to make inferences about the ways in which languages are likely to vary, which in turn increases their perceptual sensitivity when languages do in fact vary in the predicted ways.",>Bozena Pajak,">University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0062/index.html
2010,A rational account of perceptual compensation for coarticulation,"A model is presented that explains perceptual compensation for context as a consequence of listeners optimally categorizing speech sounds given contextual variation. In using Bayes' rule to pick the most likely category, listeners' perception of speech sounds, which is biased toward the means of phonetic categories (Feldman & Griffiths, 2007; Feldman, Griffiths, & Morgan, 2009), is conditioned by contextual variation. The effect on the resulting identification curves of varying category frequencies and variances is discussed.

In a set of experiments, we investigate whether interactive effects emerge between the two most disparate domains: pragmatic inference and acoustic speech perception. We use contexts that trigger pragmatic expectations regarding upcoming coreference (expectations for either he or she), and, in those contexts, we test listeners' identification of phonetic category boundaries (using words on the /hi/~/∫i/ continuum). The results indicate that pragmatic inference can indeed alter listeners identification of phonetic categories.",>Hannah Rohde>Marc Ettlinger,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0064/index.html
2010,Individual Differences in Attention During Category Learning,"A central idea in many successful models of category learning---including the Generalized Context Model (GCM)---is that people selectively attend to those dimensions of stimuli that are relevant for dividing them into categories. We use the GCM to re-examine some previously analyzed category learning data, but extend the modeling to allow for individual differences. Our modeling suggests a very different psychological interpretation of the data from the standard account. Rather than concluding that people attend to both dimensions, because they are both relevant to the category structure, we conclude that it is possible there are two groups of people, both of whom attend to only one of the dimensions. We discuss the need to allow for individual differences in models of category learning, and argue for hierarchical mixture models as a way of achieving this flexibility in accounting for people's cognition.",>Michael Lee>Ruud Wetzels,">University of California, Irvine>University of Amsterdam",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0065/index.html

The present study is designed to investigate individual differences in relation to deference, a key indicator of essentialist thought. This replicates previous findings of individual differences in deference, and demonstrates a strong association between deference and field dependence (Witkin et al., 1962). In spite of the status of field dependence as a cognitive style, this study finds it has highly localised influences in relation only to categorisations and categorisation-related actions that are partly social in nature.

2010,"When Comparison Helps: The Role of Language, Prior Knowledge and Similarity in Categorizing Novel Objects","Research suggests a developmental shift from forming categories based on perceptual features, to recognizing deeper characteristics and relationships. One process found to highlight deeper properties is comparison between items. The bulk of the research on comparison, however, has been done with familiar items or familiar relationships. An open question remains: under which conditions will comparison help children attend to the deeper properties of novel objects? In two experiments we explore the effect of comparison in a word learning task and its interaction with prior knowledge, language support, and the perceptual features of the compared items. Our results suggest that comparison only highlights deeper similarities when children are given some support to counteract or reduce the influence of surface level features. These results have implications for how to best teach children depending on the amount of prior knowledge that they bring to the task.",>Clare Sims>Eliana Colunga,>University of Colorado Boulder>University of Colorado Boulder,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0067/index.html
2010,Category Learning and Adaptive Benefits of Aging,"We examined effects of normal aging on category learning, comparing performance and strategy choice on two learning tasks: one where a one-dimensional rule governed category membership and one where a multidimensional rule defined category structure. Paradoxically, we demonstrated that older adults can outperform younger adults in some types of complex category learning. In the current task - which required that multiple dimensions be integrated - simpler integration rules enabled more rapid achievement of reasonable levels of performance. As cognitive aging is associated with a reduction in working memory resources, older adults tended to adopt these simpler decision rules more often, facilitating complex category leaning. Results provide some unique evidence highlighting potential adaptive benefits of cognitive aging. Implications are discussed.",>Angela Merritt>Linnea  Karlsson>Edward  Cokely ,">University of Minnesota>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, >Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Michigan Technological University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0068/index.html
2010,Encoding higher-order structure in visual working memory: A probabilistic model,"When encoding a scene into memory, people store both the overall gist of the scene and detailed information about a few specific objects. Moreover, they use the gist to guide their choice of which specific objects to remember. However, formal models of change detection, like those used to estimate visual working memory capacity, generally assume people represent no higher-order structure about the display and choose which items to encode at random. We present a probabilistic model of change detection that attempts to bridge this gap by formalizing the encoding of both specific items and higher-order information about simple working memory displays. We show that this model successfully predicts change detection performance for individual displays of patterned dots. More generally, we show that it is necessary for the model to encode higher-order structure in order to accurately predict human performance in the change detection task. This work thus confirms and formalizes the role of higher-order structure in visual working memory.",>Timothy Brady>Joshua Tenenbaum,">Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0069/index.html
2010,Expertise in Visual Art is Associated with Altered Perceptual Strategies Within and Across Domains: Evidence from Eye Tracking,"Eye-movement research on expert visual artists suggests that experts in this particular domain differ from novices in their strategies for encoding to-be-rendered stimuli. However, it remains unclear if such differences are specific to the domain of expertise or independent of it (i.e., if the different strategies are utilized only in relation to perception with goals specific to rendering, or if they generalize to visual perception of any stimulus with perceptual goals other than rendering). Experiment 1 examined eye-movement strategies utilized by experts and novices when rendering familiar and novel stimuli. Experiment 2 examined performance in a recognition task that also utilized novel stimuli. Results suggest that experts possess both domain-specific and domain-independent advantages, in that they have more efficient visual encoding abilities both when rendering and not. The results of a concurrent analysis suggest a link between the encoding advantage and schizotypy, which is correlated with creative advantage, as well as with a neural profile of left hypofrontality. Implications for a two-stage model of creativity are discussed.

2010,Melody Recognition: Effects of Articulation Format,"Various surface features  timbre, tempo, and pitch  influence melody recognition memory, but articulation format effects, if any, remain unknown. For the first time, these effects were examined. In Experiment 1, melodies that remained in the same, or appeared in a different but similar, articulation format from study to test were recognized better than were melodies that were presented in a distinct format at test. A similar articulation format adequately induced matching. Experiment 2 revealed that initial perceptual (dis)similarity as a function of the location of articulation (mis)match between two instances of the melody did not accurately determine discrimination performance. An important boundary condition of the matching process was defined: Whether matching occurs depends on the physical quantity, rather than location, of fit between the memory trace and the recognition probe, suggesting a global matching advantage effect.",>Stephen Wee Hun Lim>Winston D.

2010,On the Relationship Between Entropy and Meaning in Music: An Exploration with Recurrent Neural Networks,"Meyer (1956) postulated that meaning in music is directly related to entropy--that high entropy (uncertainty) engenders greater subjective tension, which is correlated with more meaningful musical events. Current statistical models of music are often limited to music with a single melodic line, impeding wider investigation of Meyer's hypothesis. I describe a recurrent neural network model which produces estimates of instantaneous entropy for music with multiple parts and use it to analyze a Haydn string quartet. Features found by traditional analysis to be related to tension are shown to have characteristic signatures in the model's entropy measures. Thus, an information-based approach to musical analysis can elaborate on traditional understanding of music and can shed light on the more general cognitive phenomenon of musical meaning.",>Greg Cox,>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0072/index.html
2010,Simulating Cognitive Coping Strategies for Intelligent Support Agents,"People react differently to stress. According to the Cognitive Motivational Relational Theory by Lazarus and Folkman, the appraisal of stress and the emotions related to it determine whether people cope with stress by focussing on altering the situation (problem focussed) or on changing the emotional consequences of the events (emotion focussed). These different coping strategies have different effects on the long term. The coping process can be described in a formal dynamic model. Simulations using this model show that problem focussed coping leads to better coping skills and higher decrease of long-term stress than emotion focussed coping. These results also follow from a mathematical analysis of the model. The presented model can form the basis of an intelligent support system that uses a simulation of cognitive processes in humans in stressful conditions.",>Azizi Ab Aziz>Jan Treur>Michel Klein,>Vrije University Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam)>Vrije University Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam)>Vrije University Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam),https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0073/index.html

We prepared two types of audio ASEs: one was a flat artificial sound (flat ASE), and the other was a sound that decreased in pitch (decreasing ASE). These two ASEs were played after a robot made a suggestion to the users. Specifically, we expected that the decreasing ASE would inform users of the robots lower level of confidence in its suggestion. We then conducted a simple experiment to observe whether the participants accepted or rejected the robots suggestion based on the ASEs. The results showed that they accepted the robots suggestion when the flat ASE was used, whereas they rejected it when the decreasing ASE was used. We thereby concluded that the ASEs succeeded in conveying the robots internal state to users accurately and intuitively.",>Takanori Komatsu>Seiji Yamada>Kazuki Kobayashi>Kotaro Funakoshi>Mikio Nakano,>Shinshu University>NII>Shinshu University>HRI-JP>HRI-JP,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0075/index.html

These semantics can make conflicting predictions, as in the situation known as floating reinstatement. We argue that the debate about which semantics makes the correct prediction can be informed by the collection of experimental data about the way human reasoners handle these critical cases. The data we report show that floating reinstatement yields comparable effects to that of simple reinstatement, thus supporting preferred semantics over grounded semantics. Besides their theoretical value for validating and inspiring argumentation semantics, these results have applied value for developing artificial agents meant to argue with people.",>Iyad Rahwan>Jean-Francois Bonnefon>Mohammed Iqbal Madakkatel>Ruqiyabi Naz Awan>Sherief Abdallah,">Masdar Institute,, MIT>CNRS,, Universite de Toulouse>British University in Dubai>British University in Dubai>British University in Dubai,, University of Edinburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0076/index.html

In the current study, we investigated how robust the effect is, and whether explicit manipulations of the task goals can produce a similar effect. We conducted an experiment with 98 college students in which achievement goals were measured, while task goals and task structure were manipulated between subjects. Results indicated that task structure was generally a more effective way of influencing which achievement goals are adopted within a learning activity. However, task goals that promoted an evaluative context interfered with transfer for mastery-oriented learners from invention activities.

2010,Seeing Language Learning Inside the Math: Cognitive Analysis Yields Transfer,Achieving and understanding effective transfer of learning requires a careful analysis of the hidden knowledge and skills to be transferred. We present an experiment that tests a subtle prediction of such an analysis. It concluded that a critical difficulty in students learning to translate algebra story problems into symbolic expressions is in learning the grammar of such expressions. We hypothesized that exercises requiring students to substitute one algebraic expression into another would enhance students algebraic grammar knowledge. This hypothesis led to a counter-intuitive prediction that learning to symbolize story problems could be better enhanced through practice on dissimilar looking substitution exercises than through practice on more similar looking story problems. We report on an experimental comparison involving 303 middle school students that supports this prediction. We discuss how having learners externalize a uniform abstract form and get interactive feedback on it may be important factors in enhancing transfer.,>Ken Koedinger>Elizabeth McLaughlin,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0079/index.html

In a one-on-one tutoring experiment we manipulated framing while controlling for several known transfer mechanisms. We contrasted an expansive framing in which students are positioned as contributing to larger conversations that extend across time, places, people, and topics, with its opposite. We then measured the degree to which high school biology students transferred knowledge from a learning session about the cardiovascular system to a transfer-of-learning session about the respiratory system. We found that students in the expansive condition were more likely to transfer: (a) facts, (b) a conceptual principle, and (c) a learning strategy from one system to another.",>Randi A.

2010,"WIN!! vs. win: Impact of ""Outcome"" Salience on Illusion of Control","In contingency judgment tasks (CJT) people typically overestimate their control over an outcome. We hypothesized that this outcome density effect (a type of illusion of control) may be due to an attentional bias toward positive outcomes, which may lead one to ignore negative outcomes and thus to underestimate their occurrence. In order to directly test this hypothesis, we manipulated the outcomes salience in a CJT, inducing participants to focus on either positive or negative outcomes. Results showed that enhancing the salience of positive outcomes (wins) enhanced participants judgment of control more so than enhancing than of negative outcomes (losses). Moreover, when positive outcomes were salient, participants overestimated the amount of money they had earned during the experiment. In sum, the salience of the outcome event affected both judgment of control and memory for positive, more than for negative events, implying that attentional mechanisms may play an important the role in the illusion of control phenomenon.",>Stefania Mereu>Alejandro Lleras,">UIUC, Sapienza>UIUC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0082/index.html
2010,Signs of Non-Linearity in Base-Rate Neglect,"Base-rate neglect, the tendency of adults to ignore the prior probability of an event, has been well-studied over the past decades. However, the evidence for base-rate neglect and its theoretical implications are still debated. We argue that such lack of agreement comes from the mistaken assumption that performance unequivocally reflects cognitive processes. We adopt a different viewpoint, namely that performance reflects existing constraints in the person-task relation. To test whether this viewpoint is appropriate for performance in base-rate problems we manipulated the constraints available in the tasks response options. With a highly constraining response mode adults are expected to exhibit the classic base-rate neglect, with little variability in their performance as procedural factors are manipulated. However, with a less constraining response mode performance is expected to be more variable and more susceptible to subtle changes in the task procedure. Results support this view, demonstrating non-linear context effects in decision making.",>Christopher Erb>Heidi Kloos,>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0083/index.html
2010,Mathematically Modeling Anchoring Effects,"This article proposes a method by which anchoring effects can be mathematically modeled. Anchoring effects are a type of assimilation effect; so this article proposes using Andersons (1965; 1981) integration model to model anchoring effects, as it is typically used to model other assimilation effects. The difficulty in using the integration model is that doing so requires that the modeler knows or is able to estimate participants unbiased estimates (i.e., what their estimates would have been had they never seen the anchor) and this information is not available from conventional anchoring effect paradigms. A method for estimating unbiased estimates is proposed. This method is used to estimate unbiased estimates for a set of anchoring effect data and the integration model is fit to these data. This article closes by speculating on possible theoretical insights into anchoring effects that might be gleaned by using the proposed methodology and possible practical applications.",>Jessica Choplin>Mark Tawney,>DePaul University>Industrial/Organizational Solutions,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0084/index.html

2010,Response Choice When Telling Lies,"It is commonly believed that telling a lie is more difficult than telling the truth. However, the precise reason for this difficulty remains uncertain. The Activation-Decision-Construction Model (ADCM; Walczyk, Roper, Seemann & Humphrey, 2003) suggests that telling a lie will take longer than telling the truth due to the additional processes involved, such as suppression of the truth. Experimental work investigated the lie construction component of the model by manipulating the number of plausible lie responses available. Participants lied and told the truth regarding the colour of a square presented on a computer screen. Results support the general claims of the ADCM, but suggest that longer response times when individuals lie to questions with more than one possible lie response relate to a fixed cost choice between multiple response possibilities. This contributes to current understanding of which situations may enhance processing differences between telling a lie and telling the truth.",>Emma Williams>Lewis  Bott>Michael Lewis>John Patrick,">School of Psychology, Cardiff University>School of Psychology, Cardiff University>School of Psychology, Cardiff University>School of Psychology,, Cardiff University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0086/index.html
2010,Does Practice Narrow the Radius of Spatial Interference in Mental Images?,"When people attempt to generate a mental image of a complex, verbally-described path, crowded regions of the path suffer from spatial interference (Lyon, Gunzelmann & Gluck, Cognitive Psychology, 57, 2008). A path is presented as a sequence of one-unit segments within a 7x7 grid, analogous to city blocks (e.g. Up 1 [Block]; Right 1; Down 1, etc.). Participants must decide whether each new segment intersects with a prior part of the path. Initially, prior segments of a path within 2 grid spaces of the current path segment produced spatial interference. Although there were substantial individual differences, for most participants interference radius was reduced to one grid space with under 10 hours of practice. One possible explanation for this reduction is that, with practice, people can learn to attend selectively to increasingly smaller areas within a vision-like representation of the mental image, in the absence of any actual visual stimulus.",>Don Lyon,>L3 Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0087/index.html
2010,A Sense of Order: Numerical ordering ability predicts complex mental arithmetic performance,"What are the key cognitive factors that characterize the potential difference between symbolic and non-symbolic representations of numerical magnitude, and can individual variability in such factors be used to predict differences in more complex mathematical processes? We suggest that the availability of information about relative numerical order is a critical factor that distinguishes symbolic from non-symbolic numbers. In the current experiment, we provide evidence that individual variability in symbolic numerical ordering ability strongly predicts performance on a series of complex mental arithmetic tasks even when controlling for a wide array of competing factors, including individuals precision in non-symbolic magnitude representations. Moreover, symbolic numerical ordering ability is shown to fully mediate the previously reported relation between non-symbolic magnitude processing and more complex mathematical skills.

2010,Imaginary affordances shape childrens preference judgments,"Motor fluency influences preference judgments: people tend to like things they can manipulate easily. Yet, links between motor fluency and preference extend beyond the domain of concrete objects that afford physical manipulation. People implicitly associate abstract ideas like goodness and intelligence with locations in space that ordinarily afford fluent actions. How do these abstract associations develop? Here we tested whether childrens preference judgments are influenced by implicit affordances of imaginary objects. Children imagined helping a cartoon character store toys in a bookcase, drawn next to the character. They tended to assign toys the characters liked to locations on the shelves that would afford fluent actions and toys they didnt like to locations that would afford less fluent actions. Crucially, the fluent location was determined by implicit constraints on the characters actions, not by the childs own action affordances. Imaginary affordances may help link concrete motor actions with abstract preference judgments.",>Tania Henetz>Daniel  Casasanto,">Stanford University>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Neurobiology of Language Group, Nijmegen, NL",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0089/index.html

When multiple problem states have to be maintained, performance decreases sharply, an effect referred to as the problem state bottleneck. We investigate this bottleneck using a triple-task, in which participants have to solve subtraction problems, enter text, and perform a listening task concurrently. The triple-task confirmed the existence of a problem state bottleneck. To explain the behavioral results in detail, a cognitive model was developed using ACT-R (Anderson, 2007) and the threaded cognition theory (Salvucci & Taatgen, 2008). The model showed a close fit to the emperical data. It was subsequently used to generate fMRI predictions for five brain areas. These predictions where tested in an experiment, showing a good correspondence between model predictions and fMRI data, indicating that the problem state bottleneck is probably located in the intraparietal sulcus.",>Jelmer Borst>Niels Taatgen>Hedderik Van Rijn>Andrea Stocco,">University of Groningen, Carnegie Mellon University>University of Groningen, Carnegie Mellon University>University of Groningen>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0090/index.html
2010,Grounded Congruency Effects Between Vertical Meaning and Vertical Responding: Not Replicated,"According to theories of grounded cognition, words whose semantics are associated with a salient vertical position (e.g., CEILING vs. CARPET) should activate simulations of these positions in space. When responses are analogously made in the vertical dimension, grounded congruency effects should result (e.g., processing CEILING should be faster for an UP vs. DOWN response). Previous research obtained grounded congruency effects when participants used ink color (RED vs. BLUE) as a cue for response direction (Casasanto, 2008). Typically researchers assume that these effects are automatic, but they could possibly be strategic. Two experiments attempted to assess this issue with 6 groups of 24 participants each, but failed to replicate the original grounded congruency effect, leading us to question its reliability when ink color is used as a cue. We further discovered a motor facilitation effect for upward as opposed to downward responses not reported previously in this paradigm.",>Lauren McDonough>Christine Wilson-Mendenhall>Lawrence Barsalou,>Emory University>Emory University>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0091/index.html

Behavioral experiments, the standard for psychological inquiry, are time consuming and focus on one variable to achieve accurate results. Instead, MIReR provides a dynamic, holistic way of exploring data collected from user experiences. A unified representational framework makes this possible -- designers provide a concept map that describes the intended meaning behind the sounds and visuals, and their relationship. This map is analyzed by MIReR's cognitive architecture and compared to user experience data to produce an estimate of the user's cognitive load.

The present investigation sought to examine the influence of interpersonal context on filler use (um, uh) while answering factual questions. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated differences in computer versus human interaction. As predicted, more fillers were uttered when interacting with a human than with a computer. Experiment 3 sought to examine a self-presentational view of filler use, whereby the mere presence of another human should increase ones use of fillers. Consistent with a self-presentational account, mere presence of the experimenter elicited more fillers than when the experimenter was absent. A cross experimental analysis revealed that while mere presence increases filler production, the need for interpersonal coordination increases filler use above and beyond mere presence. These results are consistent with at least two views of filler function: (1) fillers are used to save face and (2) fillers are used to coordinate interpersonal interactions.",>Esther Walker>Evan Risko>Alan Kingstone,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0093/index.html

We presented mice with an interval timing task: with probability p, mice were reinforced for staying at the first hopper until time t. With complementary probability 1-p they were reinforced for arriving at the second hopper before t+k. Because no animals are perfect timers, this task was difficult due to small k. Depending on p, the optimal switch point changed: if long trials were more likely, switching too late became more costly than switching too early, so the optimal switch time occurred later. Subjects showed highly significant (p<0.005) differences in their mean switch times when p was manipulated. Moreover, subjects were able to update their frequency estimates when the underlying probabilities of trial types changed and their estimates converged on accurate values quickly in comparison to plausible Bayesian optimal models.",>Aaron Kheifets>C.

2010,The Specificity of Non-Arbitrary Sound-to-Meaning Correspondences in Spoken Language,"Sound symbolism, or non-arbitrary correspondences between the sound of a word and its meaning, is an inherent property of natural language. Although previous research suggests that listeners are sensitive to sound-to-meaning correspondences, little is known about the specificity of these mappings. The present study investigated whether sound symbolic properties correspond to specific meanings, or whether these properties aid mappings to other semantic dimensions as well. English-speaking adults heard sound symbolic foreign translations of four adjective pairs (big-small, pointy-round, fast-slow, still-moving), and for each foreign word, chose which of two English antonyms (matched or mismatched with word dimension) was its correct translation. Participants reliably matched foreign words to their correct meanings, as well as to related semantic dimensions, suggesting not only that listeners utilize sound-to-meaning correspondences to infer the meanings of unfamiliar words, but also that sound-symbolic properties facilitate word-to-meaning mappings within a range of associated and co-varying semantic dimensions.",>Christina Y.

2010,Pattern Recognition Principle Theoretical Model of Mind-Brain Functioning,"The Computational Theory of Mind and the Connectionist Neural Model are actually the dominant cognitive models in the scientific community. But there is still a discussion about their compatibility as the basis of Cognitive Science. A more fundamental explanation of this two leading cognitive mechanisms in physical basis can give a better explanation of the mind and brain phenomena. I propose the concepts of PATTERN RECOGNITION-PROCESSING-LEARNING as NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT PRINCIPLE to build a solid foundation of cognitive science. This encloses a general body-mind, physical, psychological, neural, functional and computational reductionist explanation of the mind cognitive phenomena. Supporting arguments are: 1- Pattern recognition is a necessary principle for cognitive science. It is a key process in many different scientific areas, but no cognitive science model takes it formally for a general brain-mind theory. 2- The equivalence of the physical-neural-computational mechanisms of pattern recognition as the basis of the cognitive phenomena in performing all cognitive functions (sensory, memory, learning, processing, logical, feeling, emotions, thought, consciousness, etc) , which are here demonstrated. 3- I also propose some key biological cognitive processes and strategies strictly related to pattern recognition processing. 4- A definitional-explicative modeling building theory is also shown giving simple, understandable and unambiguous definitions and scientific explanation of most key cognitive concepts like thinking, self and consciousness. Such a theory is of fundamental importance because those type of cognitive concepts lacks even a reasonable definition. With a scientific-objective definitions we can evaluate, compare and estimate its consistency and also propose experimental and empirical experiments. As an example I suggest one preliminary definition of self-consciousness as: the recognition by the pattern recognition system of the patterns of its own activity. 5- A mathematical-logical formalism study of cognitive pattern recognition is here proposed as theoretical basis. Here a general formal definition of pattern recognition is proposed in the cognitive science scope. 6- With this theoretical formulation we are able to include other cognitive properties to any basic definition as far as needed, demonstrating it as a solid and promising theory. As any candidate as a complete theory of cognitive science, this model allow us to reinterpret all branches of human reasoning, including the philosophy and foundations of science and the human understanding of the universe. With the promising applied pattern recognition technology already in development, this model could help to give some directions to artificial intelligence and also neurobiology and psychology-sociology research.",>Gilberto de Paiva,>,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0096/index.html
2010,Individual Differences in Explaining Noisy Data,"In science, we design our inference approaches to trade off fit to observed data (models are good that fit well) and complexity (models or explanations that fit or explain everything are bad). Here, we examine how observers balance fit and complexity by asking observers to estimate causal models for noisy data. Specifically, participants are shown a number of scatterplots that vary in the number of data points shown, the noise added to the true function and the complexity of the true function. For each set of noisy data points, participants estimate a function which best captures their guess at the causal explanation between the input and the output. A generative psychological model combining Bayesian model selection and Gaussian process regression is used to examine individual differences in biases toward simple explanations.

We propose a model of first impression formation that integrates this kind of information into a coherent representation taking into account the 1) potentially asymmetric nature of inferences people make from stereotypes, traits, and behaviors, 2) prior probabilities of inferred characteristics, 3) cognitive capacity limitations in processing of incoming information, and 4) the influence of positive and negative affect in the impression.

Most processing models agree that idioms are specific combinations of ordinary words. However, models differ with respect to the exact role that these words are allowed to play. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that the relations between idiom words are specified on a lexical processing level. Specifically, we tested whether the constituent words of an idiom activate each other in the absence of an idiomatic (phrasal) context. In two lexical decision experiments, we found that this is indeed the case. However, the effect is modulated by the type of target word that precedes the idiomatic targets. Targets that are literally related to the first idiom target prevent activation of the second idiom target. The results support the superlemma model of idiom processing (Sprenger, Levelt & Kempen, 2006).",>Simone Sprenger>Hedderik van Rijn,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0099/index.html
2010,Assessing the Effectiveness of Wayfinding Directions,"Our goal was to assess peoples responses to wayfinding directions. Ninety college students rated the effectiveness of route descriptions through the basement of a university building. They also provide open-ended responses regarding wayfinding preferences and completed wayfinding anxiety, wayfinding strategy, and environmental familiarity self-report measures and a sense of direction exercise. The primary goal was to specify the descriptive features contained in effective and ineffective wayfinding descriptions. The best-rated route descriptions included more cardinal features, landmarks, left-right, distance, number, straight, and miscellaneous information than did the worst-rated route descriptions. Moreover, positive mentions of landmarks and negative mentions of cardinal directions were very frequent. As expected, women reported significantly higher spatial anxiety than did men. Men preferred orientation strategies more than did women, whereas women preferred route strategies more than did men. Women also reported poorer sense of direction and made larger sense of direction errors than did men.",>Alycia Hund>Amanda Padgitt,>Illinois State University>Illinois State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0100/index.html
2010,How Agent Placement Can Influence Perceived Boss/Co-worker Agreement in a Simulated Work Environment,"Interpersonal distance, the physical distance between people while they interact, is known to influence attitudes and other social dynamics. For example, merely sitting closer to a person who is presenting information can increase the persuasive power of that speaker. In the current work, we investigate how interpersonal distance will influence perceived agreement among employees in an office setting. Our participants read a passage that asked them to imagine working for an advertising firm and being in a meeting about employee layoffs with a boss. After looking at a picture of an employee seating arrangement that was close, medium, or far from a boss during the meeting, participants were asked to estimate how far the chairs were from the boss and to judge how much agreement they felt during the meeting. On average, participants indicated that they felt less agreement with bosses when interpersonal distance was high (versus medium or low). The results, which revealed that increased physical distance is associated with greater attitude distance, have implications for the design and use of applications for virtual meetings and more generally, social interactions in virtual environments.",>Justin L.

2010,"The structure of event representations: behavioral, imaging, and computational investigations","Event segmentation is often thought to rely on the identification of points in a sequence where there is relative uncertainty about what will happen next. We exposed participants to sequences of stimuli that had temporal structure but no variability in predictive uncertainty: each stimulus could be followed by four others with equal probability. We found reliable parsing between groups of stimuli that were preceded and followed by overlapping sets of items, suggesting that people are sensitive to temporal statistics beyond predictive uncertainty. We hypothesized that this reflects learning of temporal category structure, with items that occur in overlapping temporal contexts represented as belonging to the same category. Supporting this idea we found that, following exposure to the same structured sequence, participants sorted items based on their temporal contexts. To elucidate the mechanisms and representations supporting this behavior we consider alternative computational models of temporal structure learning and present preliminary fMRI results.",>Anna Schapiro>Timothy  Rogers>Matthew Botvinick,>Princeton University>University of Wisconsin-Madison>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0102/index.html
2010,Pair Analysis and Joint Action Theory: A Research Protocol to Study Cognition and Interaction in Visual Analytics,"Visual analytics, the science of analytical reasoning with interactive visual interfaces, calls for the development of new models of human cognition in analytic interaction with information technology. While foundational work brings traditional cognitive science models to address interaction with visualization environments, research protocols to empirically test these models in the wild are lacking. We combine a research protocol called Pair Analysis with H.H. Clarks Joint Action Theory as a theory-methods package for studying cognition and interaction in visual analytic environments. Pair Analysis, an observed analytic interaction by a subject matter expert and a visual-analytic tools expert, provides a unique empirical window into the cognitive process of analytical reasoning and the social processes of interaction. We use JAT's operational concepts to characterize analytic dyads thought processes and joint use of visualization technology. Our main hypothesis is that sustaining rhythmic interactions in Pair Analysis is indicative of sustaining cognitive flow.",>Richard Arias Hernández>Linda T. Kaastra>Brian D.

How does visual dynamic modeling facilitate the process of physical science understanding? What are the constraints on dynamic visual modeling? We carried out two studies on 4th and 7th grade children, where the presence or absence of visual models and dynamic visual models were varied. Fourth grade students were as good as 7th grade students in learning all parts of the module sequence. Children receiving dynamic visual graphics outperformed children who saw only static visual graphics, and both of these groups outperformed children who received only the oral/written part of the text. The presence of graphics, however, was not enough to ensure the learning of measurement concepts.

2010,Reversing the side-effect effect: the 'Rational Scientist' explanation,"Theory of mind, our intuitive understanding of the mind, is often conceptualized as analogous to a scientific theory with the function of predicting and explaining behavior. However, the so-called side-effect effect illustrates that moral considerations influence theory of mind judgments, and has been taken as evidence that theory of mind is fundamentally evaluative. We present new evidence for an alternative, the rational scientist view, which holds that moral evaluations inform ToM judgments, but that this relationship arises because behavior that conforms to norms (moral or otherwise) is less informative about underlying mental states than is behavior that violates norms. In two new experiments we demonstrate that different norms (moral or conventional) lead to different intentional descriptions of the same actions, and that the effect can be eliminated when norms are reversed. This view preserves the traditional understanding of ToM, but also suggests the importance of normative considerations in social cognition.",>Kevin Uttich>Tania Lombrozo,>University of California-Berkeley>University of California-Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0105/index.html
2010,MHP/RT: Model Human Processor with Real Time Constraints,"We propose Model Human Processor with Real Time Constraints as a simulation model of human behavior selection. It stems on the successful simulation model of human information processing, Model Human Processor (Card, Moran, and Newell, 1983), and extends it by incorporating three theories, Maximum Satisfaction Architecture (MSA, presented at CogSci2007), Structured Meme Theory (SMT, presented at CogSci2008), and Brain Information Hydrodynamics (BIH, presented at CogSci2008). MSA, SMT and BIH deal with coordination of behavioral goals, utilization of long-term memory that works as an autonomous system, and a mechanism for synchronizing individual with environment, respectively. MHP/RT works as follows: 1) inputs information from environment and individual, 2) MHP/RT builds a cognitive frame in working memory, 3) resonates it with autonomous long-term memory, 4) maps the resonance on consciousness to form reduced representation of the input information, 5) predicts future cognitive frames to coordinate input and working memory. http://staff.aist.go.jp/kitajima.muneo/organic-self-consistent-field-theory/index.html",>Makoto Toyota>Muneo Kitajima,>T-method>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0106/index.html
2010,CCE: Cognitive Chrono-Ethnography,"We, human beings, select next behaviors that should maximize our satisfaction by making use of meme that stores our past experiences and by processing input from environment and individual by appropriately allocating available cognitive resources. The underlying processes are simulated by Model Human Processor with Real Time Constraints, MHP/RT (to be presented at CogSci2010). On the basis of MHP/RT, this paper proposes a new study method for understanding human behavior selections in daily life, Cognitive Chrono-Ethnography, CCE. When a study field is specified, CCE defines critical parameters by conducting qualitative MHP/RT simulations, then designs ethnographical field observations and recordings of elite monitors behaviors in the space defied by the critical parameters. Structured interviews follow in order to obtain the descriptions of the participants history of behavioral development. By analyzing the results of interviews, models of present behavior selections and chronological changes will be built. http://staff.aist.go.jp/kitajima.muneo/organic-self-consistent-field-theory/index.html",>Muneo Kitajima>Makoto Toyota,>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology>T-method,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0107/index.html
2010,On the diversity of folk morality: Measuring classical positions in moral philosophy,"Moral psychology often oversimplifies moral philosophical debates into either deontological or consequentialist theories. The current research attempted to document greater variation in the extent to which participants used one of six core concepts to justify actions (i.e., appeals to religion, intuition, or one of four classical philosophical positions associated with Bentham, Hobbes, Kant, or Schopenhauer). Two hundred and fifty student participants (121 males) from the University of Granada were asked why a specific action would be morally correct or incorrect, which of the six concepts would be most adequate to justify the action, and whether they would behave similarly. Results indicated that participants agreed on a variety of diverse moral positions and that moral justification changed depending on context.

2010,Linguistic Control in Monolingual and Bilingual Language Learners,"One of the difficulties in learning a new language is controlling competition from the language(s) already known. This interference resembles between-language competition in bilinguals, whose languages are both activated in parallel (Marian & Spivey, 2003). To test whether bilingualism confers an advantage in controlling competition during language learning, we compared monolinguals' and bilinguals' ability to manage interference from English while using a newly-learned language. Participants were taught an artificial vocabulary, then their eye-movements and mouse-movements were tracked in a visual world paradigm to assess activation of English competitors while processing the new language. We found that monolinguals, but not bilinguals, looked at interlingual competitors more than at controls, indicating greater interference from English. Similarly, monolinguals, but not bilinguals, demonstrated increased attraction to competitors compared to controls in mouse-movement trajectories. Results suggest that bilingual experience promotes efficient management of native language activation, with implications for linguistic control during language acquisition.",>James Bartolotti>Viorica Marian,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0109/index.html
2010,Intent discerning agent for more intuitive visualizations,"Todays visual interfaces are capable of representing large, semantically-complex datasets; user interaction of subsets is used to maximize display space. However, what data to provide and in what context requires decisions that are computationally and graphically expensive. We have built an autonomous, rule-based intelligent agent, which sits underneath a visualization, observes user behavior, determines user intent, and, based on what was learned, predicts future interest. The agent observes user manipulation and gathers interaction information continuously. For the purposes of demonstration, the agent sits underneath a shallow visualized hierarchical graph. The agent makes a determination about user intent through simple computations on its gathered interaction information and passes its decisions back to the visualization, which displays them to the user via ambient overlay. Future work will enable the agent to direct the interface as to which data to display and in which context to display it, enabling more intuitive human-computer collaboration.",>Tera Marie Green>Steve DiPaola,>School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) Simon Fraser University>School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0110/index.html
2010,A Difference in Working Memory Capacity among Chinese Speakers Using Different Computer Word Typing Methods,"Chen & Chuang (2008, CogSci) showed that Chinese speakers using phonology-based and orthography-based computer word typing methods (zhuyin vs. cangjie) displayed differential sensitivity in processing the phonological and the orthographic information of Chinese characters. The present study examined whether the zhuyin and the cangjie users might differ in their working memory (WM) capacities. Five verbal WM tasks and five visuospatial WM tasks were administered to 24 zhuyin and 23 cangjie users, whose typing speeds were comparable (53.7 and 53.2 characters per minute). Results show that the zhuyin users scored higher on the verbal WM tasks than the cangjie users, but the two groups performed similarly on the visuospatial WM tasks. The results suggest that general cognitive abilities like the WM capacity are related to the use of a technological artifact, consistent with the extended-mind view of cognition proposed by Clark and Chalmers (1998).",>Jenn-Yeu Chen>Cheng-Yi Li,>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0111/index.html

2010,The Capacity to Discover: Working Memory and the Ability to Use Self-Explanation to Discover Early Algebra Concepts,"Prompting learners to generate explanations (self-explanation) can facilitate knowledge discovery and integration (Atkinson et al., 2000; Siegler, 2002) but does not always (Matthews & Rittle-Johnson, 2009). We examined whether greater capacity to retrieve problem-relevant information from memory (higher working-memory capacity) would enhance procedure discovery using self-explanation. Students (N=104; 2nd-4th graders) were instructed about math equivalence either before or after solving problems involving operations on both sides of the equal sign (e.g., 3+7+8=3+_). During problem-solving, some students self-explained answers, and some completed additional practice instead. Problem-solving accuracy was no different across the four conditions at posttest or retention. However, working-memory capacity moderated the effect of condition on retention. Self-explanation did not improve learning if instruction occurred first. However, when students solved problems before instruction, self-explanation benefited those students who were higher in working-memory capacity. Individual differences in learners cognitive capacities may influence when self-explanation is beneficial as a discovery tool.",>Marci DeCaro>Bethany Rittle-Johnson,>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0113/index.html
2010,"Number, Language, and Object Individuation","Recent research has suggested that the number of objects in a set affects the kinds of properties people attend to when speaking and categorizing (Barner & McKeown, 2005; Cantrell & Smith, 2009; Newstead & Coventry 2001). Here we asked whether number also affects the count-mass syntax that speakers use for common objects. Children ages 3-5 years were asked to look at pictures of common items (e.g., chairs, paper, soap) and label them. The images varied in number; children saw objects in sets of 2, 6 or 25. Results showed an effect of number on the kind of language children used. As the number of items increased, children became less likely to use individuating syntax, suggesting that objects in larger sets were seen less as individual entities and more as portions of a continuous mass. These results have theoretical implications for current ideas in number and object representation.",>Lisa Cantrell>Linda B.

The Chinese versions of Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and The Chinese versions of the Test of Non-verbal Intelligence-3rd edition were used for cognitive assessment and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2nd edition (BOT-2) and Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC) were used for motor assessment in the study. The results showed that children with FDA had significantly lower cognitive performance than TD children although their scores were all within the normal range. Children with FAD did not differ from TD children in the overall motor performance in either motor test. However, children with FAD showed worse performance than TD children in fine motor precision subtest. The performance of fine motor precision subtest was correlated with cognitive performance.

2010,I let the music speak: a model of music perception that predicts speech segmentation,"To study the relationship between language and music, we apply a successful model of music perception to segmentation of phoneme streams into syllables. Our model is a complex mixed-order multiple-feature n-gram model, with advanced back-off and smoothing capabilities. It has a long-term component, learned by unsupervised mere exposure, and a short-term component, exposed to the current stimulus; entropic weighting biases predictions between components. It was invented to simulate implicit learning of melodic pitch expectation, but it also predicts melodic segmentation, subjective expectation strength, associated neurophysiological activity, and aspects of expert musicologists' judgements. It is unusual as a Markov model in being multidimensional: it is capable of modeling sequences of objects with multiple features, using those features independently or together, and combining resulting mulitple predictions in a principled way. Here, we model phoneme/stress sequences from the TIMIT speech resource metadata, using 2,342 phoneme sequences from US English, containing 21,427 syllables and 82,611 separate phoneme occurrences. We predict syllable boundaries by rise-picking in the resulting sequence of information-content values. The model predicts given segmentation with kappa=0.48, precision is .71, recall is .63, F1=.67, correct, using phoneme and stress only, over this surprisingly small learning corpus.

Unlike traditional in-class peer reviews, these were completed online and discussed during a class period. The review occurred multiple times throughout the year. Students had a chance to correct their papers and then resubmit for a second peer-review. As compared to students who either did not have the benefit of a peer review, only a single faculty grade, and ones who only received a one-time review, those students whose papers were reviewed multiple times received significantly higher marks on their final papers as judged by an outside reviewer. The benefit of peer-reviewing has been experimentally demonstrated in the past (Dunn,1996; Topping, 1998) but faculty have been reluctant to use this pedagogical tool due to time constraints.

In this study, students enrolled in a university-level introductory physics course were trained with examples from one of four conditions: when only one quantity (either weight or lever arm length) was different on each side of the balance, or when both weight and length were different, but the correct response corresponded to the side with either the greater length or greater weight. We found that when training involved the variation of only one quantity, participants were able to transfer learning to other configurations of weight and lever arm length. However, when training involved the variation of both quantities, participants were only able to answer correctly questions similar to those with which they were trained.

2010,Verb tense and aspect in scene descriptions in a humanoid robot,"The present research implements a more human-like system of language in a humanoid robot model through improved use of grammatical constructions in described events. The present demonstrations show how the iCub humanoid robot is taught to recognize and use verb tense and aspect more appropriately. While hearing spoken verbal descriptions and watching visual displays of simple events involving objects moving on a table, the iCub robot begins to link the correct grammatical constructions with the appropriate information from its visual inputs and perceptual primitives. Thus, when it views a scene, the iCub robot is more likely to use the correct linguistic constructions to accurately describe it. In this way, past events are accurately described in the past tense, whereas ongoing events are described in the present progressive. Experimental evidence shows increased accuracy of scene descriptions for the iCub humanoid robot after learning phases involving live human-robot interactions.

Most research exploring this question has used picture or video paradigms that contain social stimuli but do not provide any opportunity for social interaction with the participant. In our study, we monitored participants eye movements as they sat in a waiting room. Participants waited while either a confederate quietly completed a questionnaire, or while a video of the same confederate filling out the questionnaire was displayed on a nearby computer. Participants fixation patterns of real vs. videotaped confederates indicated that participants actively avoided looking at the real person, while they looked more and for longer at the videotaped confederate.

2010,Exploring Phonological Levenshtein Distance Effects in Auditory Lexical Decision,"Phonological similarity among spoken words is traditionally indexed by neighbourhood density (i.e., the number of words differing by a single phoneme from the target). However, density is of limited utility for long words, which have few or no neighbours. In this study, we explored the effects of phonological similarity and word-frequency on auditory lexical decision performance, using multisyllabic words with no neighbours and a new similarity metric called phonological Levenshtein distance (PLD20), which reflects the mean number of substitution, insertion, or deletion operations required to transform a word into 20 of its closest Levenshtein neighbours. Inhibitory effects of PLD20 were observed, where words with closer neighbours were recognised slower; importantly, these effects were present for only low-frequency words, replicating previous findings with other neighbourhood measures. The properties of PLD20 make it a promising new measure for quantifying the phonological distinctiveness of multisyllabic words in spoken word recognition research.",>Lidia Suárez>Seok Hui Tan>Melvin J.

The present study was set up to investigate how childrens exploratory play is influenced by evidence that conflicts with their theory. Do children who observe inconsistent evidence play more systematically and make more informative comparisons than children who observe consistent evidence? 4- to 6-year-olds naïve theories on shadow size were assessed with the shadow task (Siegler, 1981). 52 children with one specific naïve theory were selected and shown evidence consistent or inconsistent with their theory.

The purpose of this study is to test predictions made by their theory. It considers that a deliberately chosen action is an intervention and that inferences based on choice are derived from structure of causal models in disregard of parameters of them (i.e., base rate, causal strength). In Experiment 1, we manipulated base rate and asked participants to infer probabilities conditional on deliberately chosen actions, interventions, and observations within common cause model. The estimates based on choices resembled that based on interventions and didnt reflect the differences in base rate. In Experiment 2, in which causal strength was manipulated within participants, the results revealed that participants neglected common cause.

This interrelation was investigated with respect to dynamic, live-recorded videoclips depicting everyday situations. Speakers of three languages were asked to view the clips and tell what is happening. Attention distribution to different aspects of the clips (causative actions) were measured in 2 identified areas of interest: the area where the agent is located and the area in which the entity acted upon is located. Contrary to studies on the production of single words or clauses relating to pictures (eg.

2010,Fluency and cognitive control in judgment: Influences of memory and elaborative encoding,"Recent research has documented some surprising relations between cognitive control and fluency use in consumer judgments. Theoretically, the observed link is explained by differences in elaborative heuristic search: More elaborate encoding leads to more vivid memory representations, which changes the ease of cognitive processing along with ones subjective basis for judgment. The current research presents new evidence in a stock profit estimation task, documenting a relationship between better memory and the use of fluency. Specifically, participants were provided with fictional company names that varied in their ease of pronunciation, and were asked to judge past company profits. Participants with a higher reliance on the company name pronunciation for their judgments were found to later have higher recall and recognition of company names. Results are consistent with an elaborative heuristic search account of the unusual relationship between heuristics and cognitive control.

Motivated by the gap between low-level sensorimotor experience and human-level conceptual knowledge, we contrast experiential knowledge with the classical notion of concepts. We discuss three ways in which experience and classical concepts differ: experience is dynamic rather than static, subjective rather than objective, and composed of minutiae rather than compact abstractions. We present a mechanism for abstracting from experience and show how it might recover some of the benefits of concepts while addressing some of the difficulties of classical theory. Finally, we implement a simple example which illustrates first steps towards bridging the gap between sensorimotor experience and high-level concepts.",>Anna Koop>Leah  Hackman>Rich Sutton,>University of Alberta>University of Alberta>University of Alberta,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0126/index.html

Corpora research has demonstrated that category structure is reflected in their distribution in natural language texts (e.g., Willits, 2009). The current project connects these two lines of research by examining the distributions of both kinds of categories. Findings include: Feature-based categories distributions are more similar to each other than relational categories are to each other. Relational categories appear in more diverse contexts than feature-based; however relational categories are anchored by a single frequent collocate to a greater degree than are feature-based categories. We discuss relations between corpus measures and behavioral ratings and consider theoretical implications for category representation.",>Micah Goldwater>Jon Willits,>Northwestern University>University of Wisconsin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0128/index.html
2010,Multisensory stimuli improve numerical matching abilities of preschool children,"We previously showed that giving young infants synchronous, multisensory information about number increases the precision of their numerical discriminations. Does intersensory redundancy also facilitate numerical learning in older children? Twenty-four preschool children (3-5 years) played a number matching game on a touchscreen computer. On each trial, children counted a sample numerosity whose elements were presented serially. On some trials, the sample was visual, on some auditory, while on still others audiovisual. Children were then presented with two choices and asked to touch the numerically matching array. Data support the idea that intersensory redundancy improves childrens numerical estimations. Multisensory information may be more salient than unimodal information, which could better recruit attention and result in more precise learning and remembering than when such information is presented to only one modality. Results should spur future research into whether such multisensory facilitation can be harnessed for educational benefit in the early mathematics classroom.",>Kerry Jordan>Joseph Baker>K.S.

2010,Wayfinding Tasks and Heuristics,"Wayfinding is the process of determining and following a route between an origin and a destination (Golledge, 1999). Research on wayfinding has been conducted by means of a variety of tasks making it difficult to compare research results among each other. Wiener, Büchner & Hölscher (2009) proposed a taxonomy of wayfinding tasks that classifies the tasks with respect to external constraints and the type of knowledge that is required to solve the task. Besides these two factors, heuristics play an important role for wayfinding. A number of heuristics for wayfinding tasks are documented in the literature, including but not limited to work by the authors. We will first present the taxonomy and then relate observed heuristics to the tasks. The relationship of tasks and heuristics will then be discussed with respect to superordinate concepts.",>Simon J.

2010,Auditory distraction during semantic processing: Data and a model,"An experiment is reported demonstrating how free recall of visually-presented, categorically-related lists of words is disturbed by the presence of auditory distracters which subjects were instructed to ignore. Data show that auditory distracters from the same category as the to-be-recalled items produce the most disturbance to recall and result in the most intrusion errors. Additionally, the points at which these intrusion errors occur differ dependent upon whether recall is written or spoken. A variant of the SIMPLE (Scale Invariant Memory and Perceptual Learning) model (Brown, Neath & Chater, 2007) is fit to these data and the modifications necessary to achieve this fit are discussed. It is concluded that intrusion errors are not random but are dependent upon a weighted combination of the semantic and temporal overlap between the to-be-recalled and to-be-ignored material in semantic processing tasks and free recall",>Philip Beaman>John Marsh>Dylan Jones,">University of Reading>Cardiff University>Cardiff University, University of Western Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0131/index.html
2010,How to Foster the Integration of Text and Diagrams: An Eye Tracking Study on the Use of Signals in Multimedia Learning,"Learners studying text and diagrams (multimedia) often fail to integrate information from both sources. Hence, signals that make explicit the relation between both representations should improve understanding. The current study investigated which changes in information processing can explain improvements in comprehension due to signals. In an eye tracking study 35 students learned about the functioning of the heart. In a no-signals condition, a text and diagram were presented unaltered. In the signals-condition, correspondences between the representations were highlighted by means of labels, color coding, and deixis. Signals improved understanding of text-diagram correspondences and guided attention towards diagrams. Moreover, diagrams were fixated earlier in the signals-condition. A mediation analysis showed that these changes in visual attention completely explained the effect of signals on comprehension. Hence, signals improve learning from text and diagrams by fostering learners early reference to diagrams and by increasing the amount of attention devoted to them.",>Katharina Scheiter>Alexander Eitel,>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0132/index.html

The growth and success of cognitive modeling demonstrate why modeling itself should be a primary quantitative method in the researcher's toolbox. Yet this method of scientific investigation remains under-utilized by the research community at large, in part because of the hassles in obtaining data sets to model and the difficulties in implementing models. The goal of this project is to assist scientists in their cognitive modeling efforts by creating an online repository containing data sets that can be modeled and the cognitive models themselves.

The current experiment examined the hindsight bias in animations of automobile accidents. Participants viewed eight animations in one of two conditions. Those in the foresight condition were told that some animations contained accidents and were instructed to stop the animation when they were certain that an accident would occur. Those in the hindsight condition were told that all animations contained accidents and viewed each animation twice. They viewed the entire animation first. On the second viewing, they stopped the animation when they thought a naïve viewer would be certain an accident would occur. Those in the hindsight condition stopped the animations closer to when the accident actually occurred than those in the foresight condition, demonstrating a hindsight bias.",>Dustin Calvillo>Dayna Gomes,">California State University San Marcos>California State University, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0134/index.html
2010,Strategies for multitasking: An fMRI study of individual differences in multitasking ability,"Multitasking is the ability to interleave tasks that vary in duration and the demands placed on cognitive resources. The Abstract Decision Making (ADM) task correlates with performance in real-world multitasking environments (Joslyn & Hunt, 1998). This study uses the ADM to measure multitasking ability. Our hypothesis is that use of consistent and effective task strategies can partially explain individual differences in multitasking ability. This hypothesis was investigated using behavioral and fMRI measures. The behavioral results show a correlation between strategy consistency and individual differences in ADM performance and support the strategy hypothesis. The fMRI results suggest that executive control areas of the brain are involved in task performance, but that activation in these areas alone does not explain differences in ADM performance. However, activation in other areas, including temporo-parietal regions, is correlated with individual differences in performance.",>Winston Jones>Jarrod Moss>Stephanie Doane,>Mississippi State University>Mississippi State University>Mississippi State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0135/index.html
2010,Facilitation in Second Language Word Meaning Evaluation from Masked Primes,"An experiment with 90 students learning Spanish as a second language was conducted to investigate 1) the ability of cross-language primes to facilitate semantic decisions which required L2 meaning retrieval of recently learned words, and 2) the relationship between prime facilitation and prime awareness. The priming task consisted of a Spanish word presented in the upper third of the computer display, followed by two pictures in the lower left and right corners of the display. Our results indicated facilitation in vocabulary response time was substantial at both 67 and 83 ms prime exposure duration. There was no dependable facilitation at 50 ms exposure. It was concluded that automatic prime effects, independent of strategic processing of primes, might offer an important tool for reducing the working memory load inherent in initial L2 acquisition which could allow greater opportunity for the acquisition of semantic and structural elements of the new language.",>Robert Zheng>Fernando  Rubio>Dan  Woltz,>University of Utah>University of Utah>University of Utah,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0136/index.html

To understand cognitive processes underlying the innovative design process and to reveal the characteristics of innovation-supporting environments, we examined the pattern of tool use in 43 interdisciplinary engineering design teams enrolled in a full-semester Product Realization course. Teams worked all semester on a single project, with each team being assigned a different industry-sponsored project. Group meetings were video-recorded. Team success was measured in terms of meeting client requirements, and groups were divided into high, medium, and low success. Low success groups (relative to high and medium) used smartboards and prototypes less often and paper notes relatively more often. The results suggest that more successful groups focused on group discussion, supported by large sharable screen, and transitional thinking from abstract ideas to concrete products.",>Jooyoung Jang>Christian Schunn,">LRDC (Learning Research and Development Center), University OF Pittsburgh>LRDC (Learning Research and Development Center), University of Pittsburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0137/index.html
2010,Seductive Images and Metacomprehension of Science Texts,"Although the intention behind including illustrations alongside expository text is generally to increase student motivation, interest, or understanding, images do not always have beneficial effects. Generally, students tend to have poor comprehension when learning from expository science texts. Further, they also tend to have poor metacomprehension accuracy, meaning they are not able to differentiate what they have understood well, from what they have understood poorly. In the current study, the inclusion of either conceptual or seductive images actually increased comprehension as compared to a no-image condition. The inclusion of images also tended to increase readers interest in the texts. However, including seductive images decreased metacomprehension accuracy compared to the no-image condition. This suggests that seductive images may provide readers with a false sense of fluency or understanding which could potentially undermine effective self-regulation and studying behaviors.",>Allison Jaeger>Jennifer Wiley,>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0138/index.html
2010,Emotion and association-memory,"Emotional items are remembered better than neutral items. It is unclear how this extends to memory for associations involving emotional items. We manipulated the pairings of emotional and neutral words and direction of cued-recall probes. Pairs were pure (EMOTIONAL-EMOTIONAL, NEUTRAL-NEUTRAL) or mixed (EMOTIONAL-NEUTRAL, NEUTRAL-EMOTIONAL). We asked whether emotion would enhance association-memory, independently of its effects on item-memory (e.g., target retrievability). We fit the data with a probabilistic model to obtain estimates of how emotion influenced cued recall depending on emotionality of the target or probe (item-memory effects), or relationship between constituents (association-memory effect). In a follow-up we replaced emotional words with taboo words to exaggerate the manipulation. Findings suggest that mildly emotional words reduced memory for the associations whereas taboo words neither impaired nor enhanced memory for the associations. Consistent with other recent findings, our results suggest that emotional enhancement of memory effects do not extend to relational memory.",>Christopher Madan>Christine Lau>Jeremy Caplan>Esther Fujiwara,>University of Alberta>University of Alberta>University of Alberta>University of Alberta,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0139/index.html

In particular, the problem solving literature has long sought an explanation for the processes underlying creative problem solving. The present study tested the commonly held notion that alcohol use increases an individuals creativity, using a problem solving paradigm. Participants completed the Remote Associates Task (RAT), while either sober or intoxicated to a blood alcohol content of approximately .07. It was found that intoxicated individuals outperformed their sober counterparts. These results are interpreted as evidence that alcohol use leads to a diffuse attentional state, which in turn can benefit creative problem solving.",>Andrew Jarosz>Gregory Colflesh>Jennifer Wiley,>University of Illinois at Chicago>Georgia Tech>University of Illinois at Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0140/index.html

If students have a deep understanding of a science system they should understand core concepts and be able to use their knowledge to make inferences and carryout scientific investigations. Thus, the challenge of science assessment is to develop tasks that not only tap into declarative and procedural knowledge, but also schematic and strategic knowledge that allow students to demonstrate the ability to reason through complex systems and use existing knowledge to generate new understandings. The current study investigates the range of knowledge and skills addressed by existing middle school science assessments administered at state, national and international levels.

Multiplicative systems such as this depend on place holders (zero). Preschool children (4 to 6 years of age) prior to any explicit training with multi-digit representations were asked to write 2 and 3 digit numbers. Childrens responses were collected and coded for a variety of features. Young children on their own seem to develop an additive idea about how to represent multidigit numbers, that preserves left to right place value, and uses 0 to represent group size (e.g., two hundred twenty seven = 20027 or 200207).",>Sandra Street>Richard Prather>Cody  Stitzel>Linda  Smith>Kelly Mix,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University>Michigan State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0142/index.html

This study examined the knowledge about the role of illustrations and the relationships to the motivation effect. In the first phase of this experiment, participants were required to glance over a page of a disaster prevention manual for two seconds and to answer questions as to motivation, such as Did the page motivate you to read? In the next phase, they were required to evaluate a subjective amount of information and comprehension efficiency for each page.

Providing prompts helps the first part, and students having high Need for Cognition can help the whole process. Seventy four adult vocational school students participated in a three factors (ie., self-explanation, prompt, Need for cognition) between subjects experiment. The results were different depending on the tasks and the students level of Need for Cognition. In memory tests, asking to do self-explanations or giving prompts helps students of low levels of Need for Cognition. However, asking to do self-explanations or giving prompts was not effective to students of high level of Need for Cognition. In tests measuring understanding, the main effect of Need for Cognition was significant, and three factors interaction effects was marginally significant. Giving prompts helped students of high Need for Cognition understand better.

2010,Engineering Models of Human Behavior,"The level at which a computational cognitive model provides explanations of phenomena is often unclear, especially when there is no sufficient distinction between behavior and cognition. It has been shown that human behavior is amenable to SOM modeling aiming at compressed classification and prediction. Reducible to an engineering level this modeling approach offers no associations to biologically plausible cognitive mechanisms if there is no explicated claim of correspondence between the mechanisms used and the biological mechanisms that drive behavior. At the statistical level no claim of biological plausibility is always a prerequisite for the validity of the model. Case studies of behavioral SOM models, conducted by the author, demonstrate and support the proposition that engineering models are not by default brain cognitive models or causal models of human behavior until appropriate associations have been established; prior to the latter, SOM models merely suggest algorithmic engineering solutions to challenging statistical problems.",>Spyridon Revithis,>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0145/index.html

Indeed, it is more difficult to disengage visual attention from a visual search display when responses are made by hands that are grasping the display screen than by hands that are on the lap. In the current study we assess whether the attentional modulation is due to proximity to the screen or orientation of the hands. Specifically, we contrast conditions that dissociate proximity (hands near or far from the screen) and orientation (hands spanning the display with responses toward the stimuli, hands spanning the display with responses orthogonal to the stimuli, and hands near to but not spanning the display). The results indicate that both proximity and orientation influence the allocation of attention.",>Holger Schultheis>Laura Carlson>Richard Abrams,>Universität Bremen>University of Notre Dame>Washington University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0146/index.html
2010,The effect of conventionality and aptness on suppression of metaphor-irrelevant meaning,"Metaphor comprehension needs a categorization process. The categorization process includes two different functions to the vehicle of metaphor: one is the activation of metaphor-relevant meaning, and the other is the suppression of metaphor-irrelevant meaning. Some previous studies showed that the conventionality of the vehicle and the aptness of the metaphor affect whether the categorization process happens. But they did not clarify whether these factors affect the activation and the suppression. In this point, our past study showed the evidence of the effect of the conventionality and the aptness on the activation of metaphor-relevant meaning. And in this study, we investigated the effect of these factors on the suppression of metaphor-irrelevant meaning. One experiment that consisted of a metaphor-priming task and a meaningfulness decision task showed that after metaphor comprehension, the vehicle suppress the metaphor-irrelevant meaning regardless both of the conventionality of the vehicle and the aptness of the metaphor.",>Tomohiro Taira>Takashi Kusumi,>Kyoto University>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0147/index.html
2010,A Categorization of Face Recognition Deficits in Congenital Prosopagnosia,"Congenital prosopagnosia refers to a lifelong impairment in face identification that is present from birth. In contrast to acquired prosopagnosia, where the deficit is due to brain damage, people with congenital prosopagnosia never evolve a functional face recognition system in the first place but develop compensatory processing strategies to overcome their deficit. In order to assess both deficit and compensatory processing in congenital prosopagnosia, we conducted a series of experiments with a large group of 15 prosopagnosic participants. The tests administered covered different aspects of face and object recognition: Identification under unlimited and restricted viewing times, the influence of rotation in depth, recall of target stimuli after one year, and recognition of famous faces. Based on the test results, we propose a categorization of congenital prosopagnosia along the lines of an apperceptive, associative or amnestic deficit and discuss this categorization scheme with respect to potential neuroanatomical differences underlying the deficit.",>Rainer Stollhoff>Jürgen Jost>Ingo Kennerknecht,">Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Leipzig, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Leipzig, Germany, Santa Fe Institute, Santa Fe, NM, USA>Institute of Human Genetics, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, Münster, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0148/index.html

We hypothesized that focusing on the intermediate event make the chain structure more learnable, if the causal structure is locally computed (Fernbach & Sloman, 2009). In Experiment 1, focusing is manipulated by informing which event is important. Participants who were informed that the intermediate event (B) is important inferred the chain structure (61%) more than participants who were informed the terminal event (C) is important (20%) and participants who were not informed (21%). In Experiment 2, causal mechanism between B and C was provided to focus on the intermediate event, because cause is overestimated than the effect. Participants given BC mechanism inferred the chain structure (64%) more than the participants given AB mechanism (48%).

Two experiments were conducted to explore the conditions when creators intentions affected judgments of function. Participants rated the plausibility of the two possible functions after an outline drawing of an object and verbal description of creators intentions were presented to them. When one of the two functions was easily derived from the drawing (Experiment 1), the function was judged more plausible regardless of creators intention. However, the difference between the plausibility ratings of the two functions got smaller when intention did not match the dominant function. When the two functions were equally likely from the drawing (Experiment 2), creators intentions affected the perceived function of an object. The results of two experiments suggested that creators intentions affect the judgment of function only when affordances are not strong.",>Kyung Soo  Do>Kyuhee Kim,>Sungkyunkwan University>Sungkyunkwan University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0150/index.html
2010,A Computation Model synthesizing the Rule based and Experience based Cognitive Processes of Chinese Characters,"A new model organizing two self-organizing maps (SOM) is presented here for synthesizing the rule based and experience based cognitive activities in support of processing the sounds and forms of Chinese characters. One SOM is constructed to form the phonological representations generated from the Chinese PatPho (Zhao & Li, 2009); and another SOM is aimed to produce the orthographic representations according to the Chinese character coding system (Chen, Zhao, & Li, 2009). The two SOMs are connected by an associative learning algorithm in shaping the mapping between the phonological and form patterns. The mappings belong to the phonetic radical and characters with this radical are suggested to construct the Chinese phonetic-and-sound relations. This presentation summarizes the tests on a specific group of characters representing the typical phonetic-and-sound relations. Insights of this model would reveal if these mappings are the origins of the rule based and experience based cognitive activities respectively.",>Sau-chin Chen>Jon-Fan Hu>Ping Li,>Tzu Chi University>National Cheng Kung University>Pennsylvania State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0151/index.html

In one condition, participants were represented as 3D avatars in a virtual space. In another, no avatars were visible. It was hypothesized that triads would outperform dyads due to facilitation from a third perspective, and that having avatars visible would increase participants sense of presence and task involvement, resulting in better performance. Participants were given standard brainstorming instructions that emphasized withholding criticism, generating unusual ideas, generating as many ideas as possible, and piggybacking on others ideas. The task was to generate ideas as for how to improve the university. Participants were surveyed after the problem solving task regarding their sense of presence and task involvement. Triads outperformed dyads but there was no facilitation of presence or idea generation from having visible avatar representations.

2010,Semantic richness modulates early word processing within left-lateralized visual brain areas and enhances repetition priming,"Repetition priming has been shown to be modulated by prior knowledge about structural regularities (Stark & McClelland, 2000). Here, we examined influences of higher-level semantic knowledge, more specifically the richness of semantic representations, on repetition priming. The EEG was recorded while twenty-four participants performed a visual lexical decision task on 160 words and 160 pseudowords. Within the word stimuli, we orthogonally manipulated two measures of semantic richness, namely the number of semantic features (McRae et al., 2005) and free associations (Nelson et al., 2004); the whole stimulus set was presented twice. The number of semantic features modulated the amplitude of the posterior N2 component over left occipito-temporal areas. This effect arose only about 30 ms after the onset of lexicality effects on left-lateralized N170 amplitudes, presumably reflecting visual word form processing within the fusiform gyrus. Thus, word form and meaning are accessed in rapid succession within left-lateralized visual brain regions. Repetition priming was consistently enhanced for words with many semantic features in both performance and ERP data, suggesting a role for feature-based semantic richness in word repetition priming.",>Milena Rabovsky>Werner  Sommer>Rasha  Abdel Rahman,>Humboldt University at Berlin>Humboldt University at Berlin>Humboldt University at Berlin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0153/index.html
2010,The role of stimulus familiarity in non-linguistic sequence learning,"Recent experiments suggest that the mechanisms employed in language learning are also involved in sequential learning of non-linguistic stimuli and are therefore domain-general. However, the non-linguistic materials typically used in these experiments (e.g. Kirkham, Slemmer & Johnson, 2002) do not adequately replicate the internal complexity of words in language. Furthermore, stimulus familiarity appears to play a crucial role (Saffran, 2007). We explore both factors, investigating the acquisition of non-adjacencies (ubiquitous in language) in non-linguistic sequences. Crucially, the black and white matrix patterns we use are orthographically matched with an artificial language, replicating the componential re-use of elements in language or speech (Sturm & Smith, 2009). Prior to the sequence learning experiment, participants were familiarized with individual patterns. The results show that although participants became familiarized with the patterns, they were unable to identify the grammar underlying sequences of those patterns.

We assessed these abilities in children in Grade 1 (N = 144) and followed them to Grade 2 (n = 102). In Grade 1, subitizing and finger gnosis were related to childrens number system knowledge and all three component abilities were related to calculation skill. Using cluster analysis, we identified three groups of children based on skill profiles across subitizing, finger gnosis, and finger tapping. One group had strong subitizing, finger gnosis and finger agility  they also had good numeracy performance both concurrently in Grade 1 and longitudinally in Grade 2. Two other groups both performed worse than the highly-skilled group on numeracy measures in Grade 1 and Grade 2; these two less-skilled groups showed strikingly different patterns of performance on number comparison, a task designed to assess the representation of number.",>Marcie Penner-Wilger>Lisa Fast>Jo-Anne LeFevre>Brenda L.

Such an influence has been largely ignored within the domain of spatial language, which has largely focused on objects and their identities, independently of the environments in which they occur. To investigate whether the environment also has an influence, we instructed participants to place a located object either near or far from a reference object within survey perspectives of manipulated 3D environments. When a geographical feature in that environment was present and had meaningful semantic content, it systematically altered the distance, direction and orientation of the placements, with these alterations well beyond the range expected based on a geometric definition of the spatial term.

2010,Artificial Cognitive Systems for Human-like Situation Awareness Ability,"The Artificial Cognitive Systems (ACS) will be investigated for human-like functions such as vision, auditory, inference, and behavior. Especially, computational models and artificial HW/SW systems will be devised for Proactive Knowledge Development (PKD) and Self-Identity (SI). The PKD model provides bilateral interactions between robot and unknown environment (people, other robots, cyberspace). For the situation awareness in unknown environment it is required to receive audio-visual signals and to accumulate knowledge. If the knowledge is not enough, the PKD should improve by itself though internet and others. For human-oriented decision making it is also required for the robot to have self-identify and emotion. Finally, the developed models and system will be mounted on a robot for the human-robot co-existing society.

2010,Comprehension and a Complex Task: A construction-integration study of individual performance in a non-routine task situation,"Comprehension is the ability to relate background knowledge to incoming information to build a situation model (Kintsch, 1998). The Construction‐Integration (C/I) architecture of comprehension has been shown to predict individual performance on complex but routine tasks (e.g., Doane & Sohn, 2000). This study tests the ability of the architecture to explain and predict non‐routine (unexpected) instrument flight performance in aviation piloting. The behavioral results indicate significant differences in individual pilot ability to detect and recover from unexpected instrument failures as a function of piloting expertise. However, expertise is not the sole predictor of performance. The computational experiments indicate that the C/I architecture explains and predicts a significant amount of individual pilot performance. Overall the findings suggest that comprehension‐based processes play a significant role in understanding human performance in unexpected situations.",>Paul Ladny>Jordan McGuire>Randy J.

2010,Competitive Routes to Belief and Their Impact on Future Learning,"Models of belief formation and conceptual change have begun to allow for affective preferences and motives to supplement normative processes, such as reasoning and coherence evaluation (Kunda, 1990; Thagard, 2006). Griffin (2008) goes a step further in arguing that affect can be a separate competitive route to belief formation that could prevent these normative processes from taking place. One implication is that affect-based beliefs will lack the conceptual coherence presumably produced by engaging in reasoning and coherence evaluation processes. Borrowing from the expertise literature (e.g., Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995), this reduced conceptual coherence should hinder ones ability to represent new domain-related information. We present a study showing that a persons route to belief (evidence or emotion based) predicts their comprehension of belief-relevant information, even after controlling for several general and domain-specific individual differences in knowledge, skills, dispositions, motivation, and task engagement.",>Carlos R.

2010,Unique and Additive Effects of Self-Explaining and Contrasting Cases on Learning Fraction Division,"Studies show that both contrasting cases and self-explanation are useful in promoting procedural and conceptual knowledge when learning from worked examples. It is not clear whether these instructional tools draw on similar problem-solving skills or provide unique support for learning. The purpose of this study is to assess whether self-explanation and contrasting cases are more effective when combined than when applied separately. To the extent that these processes can be manipulated separately, we hypothesize that the effects of both instructional techniques are unique, and together will lead to greater knowledge gains. Participants completed a pretest, assessing their ability to divide fractions, before engaging in a problem study session and procedural lesson about fraction division. Participants then completed the posttest, which included procedural and conceptual transfer measures. Pilot data suggest that there are differences between the benefits of self-explanation and contrasting cases on procedural and conceptual learning.",>Shanta Hattikudur>Pooja G.  Sidney>Martha W.

2010,When dog is more wolf than bone: Computational and electrophysiological evidence for featural organization of semantic memory,"Semantic space algorithms account for human performance in semantic tasks via knowledge representations derived from the analysis of large text corpora. The N400 Event-Related Potential (ERP) component is thought to reflect automatic access of the same lexical-semantic information. We trained LSA (Landauer & Dumais, 1997) and HAL (Lund & Burgess, 1997) on a random selection of Wikipedia articles and compared the algorithms performance at predicting the similarity between N400 waveforms elicited during reading. HAL was best at explaining the ERP data, suggesting that its representationsthought to be more semantic-featural than lexical-associative in natureare most similar to those automatically accessed during N400 processing. These results are consistent with findings that, although the N400 is sensitive to lexical relationships, it seems to represent access of information arranged primarily by semantic features. Preliminary evaluations of other algorithms (e.g., COALS, Rohde, Gonnerman & Plaut, submitted) further support this conclusion.",>Sarah Laszlo>Blair Armstrong>Joseph MacInnes>David Plaut>Kara  Federmeier,">Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Oculus Info.

Participants (N = 45) completed two inattentional blindness tasks, in which an unexpected object appeared while participants performed a primary task. Participants were asked if they noticed the unexpected object. They were then shown the unexpected object and asked how many people (out of 100) they thought would be able to see it. For both tasks, those who saw the objects (Task 1: n = 5; Task 2: n = 19) judged that more people would see it (overall: M = 39.8, SD = 23.0) than those who did not (overall: M = 17.1, SD = 14.6).

2010,A decision science blind to decision procedures would be unfair: The effect of decision process on decision-outcome satisfaction and subsequent choice in a performance environment,"Contemporary models of decision making assume individuals evaluate options solely in terms of their expected outcomes. However, recent research indicates that in institutional settings decision makers are also concerned with the procedural fairness of the decision process that generates those outcomes, such as whether decision makers were granted democratic inclusion in the decision-making process itself. We provide a much-needed quantification of the value decision makers place on inclusive decision procedures, showing (a) the pattern by which decision procedures alter individuals perceptions of otherwise identical outcomes, spanning losses and gains of differing quantity and quality (e.g., failure/success) and (b) that decision makers felt freedom and feeling of being treated respectfully mediate the effect of decision process on the perception of outcomes. We show that individuals prefer lesser economic returns in order to receive higher utility from the decision process, and we discuss the implications of this finding for decision science.",>Daniel DeCaro>Joseph Johnson,>Miami University (MU)>Mimia Univeristy (MU),https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0164/index.html

Effects have been associated with hormonal regulation of prefrontal (PFC) and parietal (PAR) cortices, regions implicated in WM function. Determining the pathophysiology of these sex differences has implications for understanding individual differences in WM. Using fMRI, we assessed WM using an N-back task and acquired hormonal status in 13 males and 13 females. Findings demonstrated sex differences in brain activity and connectivity between PAR and PFC, which were associated with female hormonal status. We suggest that hormones may regulate the gain of neuronal activity in PFC and PAR, leading to less diffuse activation in women compared to men, the effect for which we propose a neural network model.",>Brandon Abbs>Jill Goldstein,">Harvard Medical School, , Brigham and Womens Hospital Connor's Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology, , MGH-MIT Athinoula Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging>Harvard Medical School, , Brigham and Womens Hospital Connor's Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology, , MGH-MIT Athinoula Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0165/index.html

We examined whether this assumption is valid by studying how verbal cues affect where people look. In previous work using a live performance of a magic trick, verbal cues by the magician were shown to affect shifts in gaze. We extended this work by recording a similar trick in HD video and having observers watch the video while wearing an eye-tracker in order to investigate the effects of presentation medium (live vs. video) on social attention. While we discovered several key similarities across presentation mediums (e.g., verbal cues affected social attention), there were also some remarkable differences as well (e.g., the strength and frequency of the attention effect).

2010,Declarative and procedural memory abilities as predictors of successful adult language learning,"Evidence from two related but independent fields of research, second language acquisition (SLA) and cognitive neuroscience, suggests that some adult learners do reach high proficiency in an L2, as assessed by performance on language tasks. Not much is known about how or why certain adults attain high proficiency while others do not. Certain cognitive abilities, specifically procedural and declarative memory systems, may factor into language proficiency. This research aims to address this question by examining how individual differences interact with implicit language learning. Subjects completed a battery of cognitive tests including the Tower of London task, the Continuous Visual Monitoring Task and the Modern Language Aptitude Task, and learned an L2 under implicit training conditions. After practicing on comprehension and production tasks, subjects were given a grammaticality judgment task. A multiple regression was conducted to determine what cognitive abilities are unique predictors of L2 aptitude (as measured by the GJT).",>Katherine Brill>Mandy Faretta>Francis  Wong>Patrick Wong>Kara Morgan-Short,>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>University of Illinois at Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0167/index.html

Posited universal cognitive systems have, as a result, fundamentally been shaped by mammalian physiology and phylogeny, with findings largely supporting a ratio-based system. Explorations of large number discrimination with wild populations of any kind have, until now, been virtually unknown. Extant evidence on avian numerical capacity either focuses on large number discrimination in trained pigeons within a laboratory setting or object identification in terms of clutch size and brood parasitism in water fowl. Heretofore, no evidence has been uncovered to indicate the precise cognitive mechanisms that may be deployed in avian numerical choices of more in a natural setting.

In the present study, we tested whether participants who respond relatively quickly when making predictions about an entity are distinguish more or less between human and nonhuman agents. Participants responded to a series of five scenarios in which they chose between intentional and nonintentional actions for a human, a computer, and a robot. Those who chose quickly were more likely to distinguish human and nonhuman agents than participants who deliberated more over their responses. We suggest that the short-response time participants were employing a first-line default to distinguish between human intentionality and more mechanical nonhuman behavior, and that the slower, more deliberative participants engaged in deeper second-line reasoning that changed their predictions for the behavior of a human agent.",>Daniel Levin>Megan  Saylor>Simon  Lynn,>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0169/index.html
2010,Cross-Modality Strategy Transfer: A behavioral study of strategic discrimination skill acquisition and transfer across auditory and visual modalities,"Discrimination is the ability to differentiate one object from another. Previous research suggests that with practice, individuals develop efficient discrimination strategies, and that strategies acquired in training transfer within a modality to novel stimuli (e.g., Haider & Frensch, 1999; Sohn, Doane, & Garrison, 2006). This study examines whether discrimination strategies transfer across presentation modalities. Subjects were trained to make difficult (similar) or easy (dissimilar) discriminations among visual or auditory objects during training. At transfer, subjects made difficult discriminations among stimuli presented in a different modality. Results suggest that the strategy acquired by subjects trained on difficult discriminations leads to superior performance at transfer compared to subjects trained on easy discriminations regardless of the modality of initial training and the modality switch at transfer. Cross]modality transfer was observed, and this suggests the role of a central mechanism in the acquisition and transfer of strategic skills.",>Hao Bai>Paul Ladny>J. Gregory Trafton>Randy J.

2010,Thats what she said: The effect of emotional prosody on the interpretation of intent.,"Nygaard and Lunders (2002) have shown that emotional prosody impacts the resolution of lexical ambiguity during spoken language, yet sentential meaning is often ignored (Snedeker, 2008). The integration of linguistic and non-linguistic cues to speech is vital for successful interpretation of intent. Experiment 1 evaluated the perception of sentential contexts with emotional prosody (e.g., irritation, disgust, neutral, compassion, sarcasm and innuendo). Results suggested that listeners have the ability to differentially categorize the intent behind statements, based on emotional prosody. Experiment 2 evaluated the online process of categorizing sentences with emotional prosody, via systematic curvatures in the arm using the Wii remote. Results of Experiment 2 suggest that a perceiver's arm curvatures are reflective of the differentially interpreted categorized emotional information when the sentences remained stable. This supports the notion that emotional information plays a large role in the interpretation of sentential meaning, as it sharply influences the interpretation of intent.",>Jennifer M.

In this study, participants completed an old/new face memory task in three different body positions (sitting upright, lying right, and lying left) and four different image orientations (upright, inverted, 90 degrees clockwise, and 90 degrees counterclockwise), allowing us to isolate the effects of retinal versus gravitational face orientation on recognition memory. We found a main effect of retinal face orientation, with higher d to faces oriented upright versus inverted with respect to participants retinas. Keeping retinal orientation constant, we also found an effect of gravitational orientation, with higher d to faces orientated upright with respect to gravity, indicating a role of gravitational orientation in face processing.",>Nicolas Davidenko>Stephen Flusberg,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0172/index.html

McCarthy, M. Faretta, F. Wong, P. Wong, & K. Morgan-Short Poster Abstract Learning a second language (L2) in adulthood is notoriously difficult. Some learners, however, seem to learn with ease. In order to understand the characteristics of successful learners, research has explored the role of individual differences. The current study examines the role of two individual cognitive abilities: working memory and intelligence. Participants complete a battery of cognitive tasks, including a listening span test and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test. They subsequently learn an artificial language, which is meaningful, productive and consistent with natural languages, over the course of four training sessions. Language proficiency is assessed within subjects at the end of the first and final session, and a multiple regression analysis is conducted to probe the contribution of working memory and intelligence to successful L2 development. Implications for theories of L2 learning and for L2 learners are discussed.

2010,Individual differences in anticipatory eye-movements: Vocabulary size is associated with speed of noun-verb integration,"Humans can integrate information from a rapidly changing speech stream with astonishing speed. In this study, we measure the impact of vocabulary knowledge on the incremental integration of speech using language-mediated anticipatory eye-movements. Following Kamide, Altmann & Haywood (2003), Experiment 2, we examined the degree to which an upcoming sentential Theme is anticipated by a combination of information from an Agent and Verb (eg. The pirate hides the treasure vs. The dog hides the bones). Replicating prior results, combinatory effects of the Agent and Verb yielded anticipatory looks to the Theme. When participants performance was split by receptive vocabulary score, differences in anticipatory eye movements were apparent. The group with higher vocabulary scores was faster to integrate Agent and Verb information to correctly look at the upcoming Theme. Together our findings are suggest that prior language knowledge plays a pivotal role in even simple sentence processing tasks.",>Arielle Borovsky>Jeffrey Elman,>UCSD>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0174/index.html
2010,Reasoning through Mindful Actions: Effect of Instruction and Spatial Ability on Understanding Dynamic Systems,"The ability to understand systems is important for individuals engaged in various domains in science. Prior research has demonstrated direct-manipulation animation (DMA) effectively supports learners to understand dynamic systems. However, the role of learners' characteristics and scaffolding upon their performance remains unclear. The current study examines how instruction and spatial ability modulates learners executive attention when they use DMAs to learn physical systems. To demonstrate comprehension and reasoning ability, participants were asked to explain and predict outcomes of what-if scenarios. Their eye-movements during their interaction with DMAs were recorded. Participants eye-gaze patterns and learning performance revealed interactivity itself did not lead to understanding of these systems. Instead, the conjunction of attending to relevant information while actively manipulating the animation facilitated retention and reasoning. Spatial ability, however, was not significant in predicting performance. Overall, findings suggest learning with interactive animation involves cognizant interchange between bottom-up visuo-motor support and top-down cognitive control.",>Margaret Chan,">Teachers College, Columbia University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0175/index.html
2010,Are children irrational category learners? Evidence from a process model,"How do multiple labeling events influence childrens understanding of objects that can be named at multiple levels of specificity (""Rover"" or ""dog"")? To investigate, we replicated Xu & Tenenbaum (2007, Psychological Review, 114, 245-272), who found that children generalized more narrowly when three identical toys (e.g., plush Dalmatians) were labeled with a novel word compared to one toy labeled three times. Xu & Tenenbaum suggested the extra two referents provide statistical evidence that rationally supports a narrow hypothesis. In our ""extra labeling"" condition, however, children generalized broadly when each object was labeled ten times instead of once. This violates the predictions of a purely rational account and suggests situational, lower-level processes are critical to novel word generalization. A Dynamic Neural Field model is used to examine these processes, and further shows how process-oriented models can solve the problem of overlapping extensions.",>Gavin Jenkins>Jodi Smith>John Spencer>Larissa Samuelson,>University of Iowa>University of Iowa>University of Iowa>University of Iowa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0176/index.html

Here we asked how the ability to predict upcoming musical tones based on both general implicit knowledge of musical structure and familiarity with a particular tune influence early portions of the auditory evoked response (AER). Using electroencephalography, we examined how predictability influenced brain responses to repeated tunes. The musical stimuli were simple, monophonic Irish folk tunes (Normal) and Random sequences in which the notes of each tune were presented in randomized order. Because the Random stimuli lacked musical structure, we hypothesized that listeners would be unsuccessful in learning or creating predictive models for these sequences. Differences were observed in early AER between the Normal and Random sequences. The results suggest that listeners successfully learn, remember and model the Normal sequences, but are unable to do this for Random sequences.",>Kat Agres>Hia Datta>Jason Zevin,">Psychology Department,, Cornell University>Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, Weill Cornell Medical College>Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, Weill Cornell Medical College",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0177/index.html

Subjects were tracked while viewing four object pictures and a BSL video. One picture was (semantically or phonologically) related to the target sign, with target pictures present on some trials and absent on others. Like previous spoken language studies, sign perceivers looked significantly more often towards related distracters than unrelated after the onset of the target sign, regardless of target picture presence. However, results indicate important differences in the time course of looks compared to speech, with gaze to pictures infrequent (due to attention to video) and earlier, often before actual sign onset. This last occurs because, unlike speech, the preparation phase (in which sign handshape and location are attained) is visible, allowing earlier cohort activation.",>Robin L. Thompson>David P.

Japanese uses duration cues for quantitative, but not qualitative contrasts. We measured arm movements with a mouse-tracking task while native English and Japanese speakers living in the United States distinguished spectral and duration contrasts in the word pairs ""pin/pen"" and ""pen/pan."" While both groups identified the words correctly, when distinguishing pan from pen, the English but not Japanese speakers mouse-trajectories lean towards pen earlier in the trial, when the information accumulated to that point is more consistent with the shorter of the two words. This suggests that while English speakers act rapidly on incoming acoustic information as it unfolds, Japanese speakers wait for more information before responding. These results may reflect Japanese speakers expertise with duration cues from extensive experience with native quantity contrasts.",>Hia Datta>Ran Liu>Jason Zevin,">Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, WCMC & , The Graduate Center, CUNY>Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University  &  Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, WCMC>Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, WCMC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0179/index.html

Translating between such diagrams can potentially involve the intermediate step of forming an internal 3-d representation of the molecule, so we hypothesized that performance would be enhanced when concrete models were used. Thirty students were provided with models as they translated one molecular diagram into a second and their spontaneous use of the models was recorded. Students model use was coded for behaviors, such as moving, holding, reconfiguring, pointing to, or gesturing about the model. Results showed a great diversity in whether and how students used the models.

2010,I spy with your eye: On the perception of others' gaze,"Eye tracking can often be prohibitively expensive, proprietary and incredibly complex. We examined the accuracy of eye tracking using only a web camera. Participants were shown webcam recordings of a persons' eyes moving 1, 2, or 3 degrees of visual angle in one of 8 directions (North, NE, E, SE, etc) or no eye movement occurred at all. Observers judged whether an eye movement was made, and if so, its direction. Detection and direction judgments were significantly above chance across all three distances, with larger eye movements resulting in better performance. These data indicate that a webcam plus human observer system can be used to study human eye movements in a simple non-invasive manner. They also support theories of human social attention and evolution predicated on the assumption that humans have developed an especially fine ability to detect the eye movements of others and determine where those eyes are looking.",>Nicola Anderson>Craig Anderson>Evan Risko>Alan Kingstone,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0181/index.html
2010,Beyond binary: One small step across the artificial-naturalistic divide in understanding human category learning,"The foundational six types problem (Shepard, Hovland, & Jenkins, 1961) offers a limited view of human category learning due to minimal ecological validity. The SHJ types actually do address the explanatory constructs historically proposed to explain natural categories (rules, exemplars, family resemblance), but do so in an impoverished manner due to binary-valued dimensions. We studied the SHJ types using stimuli with four values on each dimension. The SHJ types become more like natural concepts with more robust intension (internal structure) and extension (category size). This allows for richer evaluation of the representations and processes underlying learner performance. Results depart from the traditional ease of learning order (I>II>III,IV,V>VI) since Type IV (family resemblance structure) shows higher accuracy than Type II early in learning. Transfer to novel items and typicality ratings reveal graded structure even in rule-described categories and show distinct signatures of the categorization basis used by each learner.",>Kimery Levering>Kenneth Kurtz,>State University of New York: Binghamton>State University of New York: Binghamton,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0182/index.html
2010,Dimension Word Knowledge and Flexible Attention Shifting,"One of the developing skills in executive functions is the flexible control of selective attention. Young children improve in this ability during the preschool years as measured by such tasks as the Dimension Change Card Sort (DCCS) which asks children to sort pictures, first by one dimension (e.g. color), and then by another (e.g. shape). Three-year-olds sort correctly by the first dimension, but do not sort correctly when the rule changes (i.e., they perseverate). By five, children switch flexibly between dimensions. This study asks about the relationship between perseveration in the DCCS and dimensional word knowledge which also improves during preschool years. Thirty children participated in a study which tests knowledge of feature terms (e.g., red, blue) and dimension terms (e.g. color, shape). Results indicate no difference in knowledge of feature terms for the two groups, but children who switch successfully in the DCCS were significantly better at dimension terms.",>Rima Hanania>Thea Ionescu>Linda B.

2010,Lay Theories and Linguistic Framing in Teaching Children about Nutrition,"Research has shown that health interventions that build wisely upon existing conceptual knowledge can be effective in producing conceptual and behavioral change. Pre-school aged children have been found to understand the relationship between food and the body principally in terms of their lay mechanical theories. A conceptual intervention is designed to build upon this emerging understanding in order to teach nutritional balance and variety. Special attention is paid to the role of linguistic framing in building coherently upon childrens existing mechanical knowledge. In particular, framing inert, inactive food as a causal agent in sentences such as milk gives you strong bones may be especially opaque given childrens mechanical understanding of nutrition, compared with framing the body as the causal agent, e.g., your bones use milk to grow strong. Results indicate that children given a body-agentivelybut not food-agentivelyframed intervention achieved greater understanding of nutritional balance and variety.",>Sarah Gripshover>Ellen Markman,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0184/index.html

One hundred sixty-two participants were shown a vehicular accident depicted either by diagrams or by an animation. Some participants saw information leading up to the accident and were asked to predict the likelihood of an accident occurring. Others saw the accident and were instructed to disregard this outcome knowledge before providing a likelihood estimate. Results contradicted previous findings; the propensity effect occurred with diagrams and the hindsight bias occurred with the animation. Evidence for the propensity effect appears to depend on how stimuli are constructed and the point at which participants are asked to disregard outcome information. The present findings indicate that different presentation modes influence decision making.",>Dayna Gomes>Dustin Calvillo,">California State University, Los Angeles>California State University San Marcos",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0185/index.html

The interactive online environment Second Life represents an interesting methodological setting for such work, offering sophisticated stimulus design software, a powerful scripting language, and a fully editable physics engine. Two well-documented phenomena of category learning are compression (where objects classified together appear more similar) and expansion (where objects classified differently appear more different). Our studies using Second Life have thus far demonstrated its utility as a research tool by 1) successfully creating a compression effect in world, 2) showing that this effect did not require verbal labels, and 3) revealing that a more interactive version of the task with much more complex and naturalistic stimuli produced learning without compression or expansion effects.",>Joshua Sturm>Peter Nachbaur>Alex Goldberg>Julianne Herts>Jan Andrews>Ken Livingston,>Vassar College>Vassar College>Vassar College>Vassar College>Vassar College>Vassar College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0186/index.html
2010,Deciding Whether or Not to Guess the Answer Predicts Subsequent Learning,"In a study on the effects of incorrect guessing on subsequently learning from feedback, we found confidence for wrong responses on an initial test was positively associated with correct final recall (higher confidence errors corrected better; Butterfield & Metcalfe, 2001). One explanation for this hypercorrection effect is that subjects are surprised by their error and thus pay more attention to the feedback (Fazio & Marsh, 2009). Inconsistent with this surprise hypothesis, however, was our finding that the decision to volunteer a low-confidence guess, even when the response was wrong, was associated with better subsequent learning of the correct answer than when a response/guess was withheld. We propose that the willingness to venture a guess, even when confidence is low, may reflect a higher state of learning, relative to choosing to omit a response. We present additional behavioral data and an error-correction neural network model in support of our alternative hypothesis.",>Sean Kang>Michael Mozer>Harold Pashler,>UCSD>University of Colorado>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0187/index.html
2010,Am I a Robot? How Verb Agency and Agent Description Influence Perspective-Taking in Visual Scenes,"People often take an egocentric perspective when describing space. However, they occasionally take an alternative perspective. When and why? In a series of experiments that followed work on perspective, we explored this question. In one experiment, participants were given photographs of two objects on a table. Objectively, the scene could be described from either the perspective of the person viewing the picture or from the opposite perspective (i.e., facing the viewer). To test which viewpoint would be elicited, we asked participants to describe where an object was relative to another. In one experiment, a toy humanoid robot (facing the participant) was included in the scene to determine whether people would take its vantage point when referring to object locations, and how this inclination might vary according to changes in linguistic context. Results indicate that people can spontaneously take the perspective of an agent-like toy when describing object locations.",>Michelle D.  Greenwood>Teenie  Matlock>Michael J.  Spivey>Justin L.

2010,The role of conventional number knowledge in young childrens nonverbal number matching: Is two special?,"Two studies examined the role of conventional number knowledge on young childrens nonverbal number matching (NVM). We hypothesized that acquiring two number words (one and two) would facilitate childrens performance on the NVM task by highlighting numerical comparisons rather than comparisons based on other variables. To test this hypothesis, two- and three-year-olds were given a NVM task that was either controlled for line-length/density (Experiment 1) or total surface area (Experiment 2). Conventional number knowledge was assessed using two tasks: Give-A-Number and How-Many. Results from Experiments 1 and 2 showed the advantage of knowing at least two number words: Two-knowers and above performed significantly better on NVM than one-knowers or non-counters. Performance of one-knowers and non-counters did not significantly differ, suggesting that childrens performance on NVM is not significantly impacted by learning only one number word.",>Mee-Kyoung Kwon>Yoonkyung Jeong>Susan Levine,>the University of Chicago>Catholic Universtiy>the University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0189/index.html
2010,A sequence analysis of actions in complex system comprehension,"Complex systems have a broad network of relations for which human comprehension is severely limited and analysts often rely on the support of technological systems. In this study we investigated whether comprehension can be augmented by IMAGE  a set of interactive visualization, data exploration and knowledge representation tools  and explore behavioural signatures associated with the optimal use of IMAGE. The comprehension and use of IMAGE of 24 participants were examined in the context of a scenario involving military convoys evolving their strategy according to the reactions of a hostile and dynamic environment. Comprehension was measured by a score normalized in function of a randomly generated exploration of the system. A sequence analysis was performed to extract the pattern of IMAGE-user interaction. Our results reveal a great diversity across participants and that transitional probability of key IMAGE events is not related to augmented comprehension in a simple structured way.",>Patrick Jeuniaux>Sebastien Tremblay>Jean-François Gagnon>Daniel Lafond>François Bernier,>Universite Laval>Universite Laval>Universite Laval>DRDC-Valcartier>DRDC-Valcartier,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0190/index.html
2010,A valid separation of location memory based on allocentric and egocentric reference frames,"A valid separation of location memory based on allocentric and egocentric reference frames Jonna Nilsson, Kenny Coventry, Nicol Ferrier The existence of two separate spatial systems, one based on an egocentric viewpoint-dependent reference frame and one based on an allocentric viewpoint-independent reference frame, is now well accepted both at a conceptual and a neurological level (OKeefe & Nadel, 1978; Lavenex & Lavenex, 2009; Zaehle et al, 2007). However, methodologies intended to separate and compare location memory based on distinct reference frames in humans vary widely and are often confounded. To allow for a more reliable separation of the egocentric and allocentric reference frames, a new location memory task was developed that eliminated these confounds. The results of a series of studies based on this task are reported and discussed. The results highlight the importance of controlling for the extraneous variables present in previous studies. It is evident that the investigation of location memory has a lot to gain from the valid separation of the allocentric and egocentric spatial systems.",>Jonna Nilsson>Kenny Coventry>Nicol Ferrier,">Northumbria University &, Newcastle University>Northumbria University>Newcastle University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0191/index.html
2010,The relationship between similarities computed by LSA and several types of association,"Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a computational theory of meaning. Meanings of words are extracted from a large corpus of texts by a statistical method and represented as vectors in a semantic space. It is known that similarities of word-pairs computed by LSA can explain various language processing of human(e.g., Landauer and Dumais, 1997). To know features of LSA, we created four semantic spaces from Japanese corpses: news paper, novels, books (except for novels), and both of novels and books. The similarities of word pairs were compared with scores in different types of association tasks. Participants were asked to associate several concepts(e.g., subordinate categories, synonyms, or action concepts) with stimulus words. As a result, a correlation coefficient between the similarities and association scores of the action concept task is the highest. This finding is consistent with Hare et al.(2009), LSA and similar models reflect people's knowledge about daily events.",>Keisuke Inohara>Takashi Kusumi,>Kyoto University>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0192/index.html

However, we in our experiment, we tried to explain this fallacy by using conditional probability.

2010,A computational model for the acquisition of referring subjects in discourse,"In this study, we investigate how children acquire adult-like performance on their use of referring subjects, by modeling experimental data within the cognitive architecture ACT-R. When choosing which type of referring expression to use, speakers have to take into account the linguistic discourse context as well as the way listeners will interpret the referring expression in that context. Children, however, tend to produce unrecoverable pronouns in particular contexts where adults would use a full noun phrase. This suggests that children are not yet able to take into account the listener's perspective. Based on simulations of our computational model, we argue that the adult use of referring subjects is crucially dependent on sufficient working memory capacity and speed of linguistic processing.",>Jacolien van Rij>Hedderik van Rijn>Petra  Hendriks,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0194/index.html
2010,Word-Form Typicality and Its Influence on Grammatical Category Assignment,"Farmer et al. (2006) found that how typical a words phonology is of other words in its lexical category influences the reading times of nouns and verbs in predictive contexts. When a preceding context generated a strong expectation for a noun, target noun-like nouns were read faster than verb-like nouns, along with a similar effect for verbs. Further, Dikker et al. (2010) found that the magnitude of the M100 response (sensitive to category-expectation violations) was modulated by phonological typicality: when a mismatch existed between whether context predicted a noun and the nouns degree of typicality, a heightened M100 response occurred in visual cortex. Here, using lexical decision and a self-paced reading, we examine whether these word-form effects occur in all cases where a noun or verb is possible, or whether they are more robust when expectations are strong, and thus visual word-form information may be enough to facilitate categorization.",>Thomas Farmer>Padraic Monaghan>Jennifer Misyak>Morten Christiansen,>Northumbria University>Lancaster University>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0195/index.html
2010,Did you say gross snails or gross nails? The problem of segmenting co-occurrences of the same segment,"To comprehend spoken language, listeners have to segment words from a continuous stream of speech. This task may be difficult when [s] repeats at a word boundary (e.g., gas station) because the two ss could blend together and form one long s-sound. Do talkers produce cues that signal the word boundary? If not, how do listeners segment the words correctly? We addressed these questions by having talkers produce two-word sequences that could be interpreted in three ways, depending on how the middle s-sound was heard (e.g. grow snails, gross snails and gross nails). Acoustic analyses of their productions examined whether there are cues indicating the presence of a word boundary. Listening experiments using the talkers productions as stimuli were carried out to determine the extent to which signal-based and knowledge-based cues are used to resolve ambiguities. Implications of the results for models of spoken word recognition will be presented.",>Dahee Kim>Colin Widmer>Christine Szostak>Mark Pitt,">OSU, Linguistics>OSU, Psychology>OSU, Psychology>OSU, Psychology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0196/index.html
2010,Expectations of common ground with a computer dialog agent,"The time required to comprehend referring expressions is influenced by many contextual factors that establish expectations, including attributes of the referent and competitors, the discourse history, and the common ground between dialog partners. When human partners violate expectations by, for example, breaking a conceptual pact to maintain a referential perspective across mentions, listeners incur processing costs. But listeners don't have difficulty when other partners refer differently. We use this response pattern to examine whether subjects process discourse from computer agents the same way as from human partners, and what expectations they have of multiple agents. As computer dialog systems mature, we expect individual computers to be running multiple dialog agents playing diverse roles: information butlers, virtual salesmen, health coaches, etc. Knowing more about the expectations humans have of these dialog partners is a fundamental first step toward designing algorithms that can generate referring expressions that are easy to comprehend.",>Donna Byron>Joy Hanna>William Hartmann,>Northeastern University>Oberlin College>Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0197/index.html
2010,Interaction of bottom-up and top-down attentional influences on the processing of contingency information,"How do individuals determine what information to attend to when making causal inferences on the basis of contingency information? Although much research has focused on the role of top-down attentional influences on this process (e.g., effects of prior beliefs and motivation), little work has addressed the role of bottom-up attentional influences, which may be driven by low-level perceptual and motor processes. In prior work, the current authors demonstrated a distinct bottom-up rightward bias in overt attention during contingency acquisition that was associated with subsequent causal judgments (Goedert & Eiter, 2008). Here we recorded eye movements of participants while they acquired information about two candidate causes whose spatial locations varied over the course of learning. We found that the bottom-up rightward bias in gaze direction persisted in spite of the varied spatial locations of the causes. Additionally, the bias interacted with top-down, knowledge-based contingency acquisition processes to influence participants gaze patterns.",>Kelly Goedert>Brianna Eiter,>Seton Hall University>Hofstra University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0198/index.html
2010,Influence on memory of the temporal schedule of repetitions over multiple days and its modulation by the retention interval,"We studied the influence on memory of three temporal schedules of repetitions of vocabulary pairs. Pairs were presented on Day 1, 7, and 13 in a Uniform schedule; on Day 1, 2, and 13 in an Expanding schedule; and on Day 1, 12, and 13 in a Contracting schedule, with schedule as a within-subject factor. Retention was tested with a cued-recall task performed on Day 15, 19 (Experiment 1), or 26 (Experiment 2). Cued recall did not differ as a function of the schedule on Day 15, whereas the Expanding schedule led to the best performance on Day 19 and 26. We interpreted this new finding of a modulation of the effect of schedule as a function of the retention interval within the frame of a model based on the study-phase retrieval theory that accounts for different forgetting curves for different schedules.",>Emilie GERBIER>Olivier KOENIG,>Université Lyon 2>Université Lyon 2,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0199/index.html
2010,Matching Exact Posterior Probabilities in the Multinomial Interactive Activation Model,"Interactive activation models of context effects in perception ((McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981; McClelland & Elman, 1986) have been criticized for failing to combine stimulus and context information in a Bayes-optimal way, leading to a rejection of interactive approaches (Norris & McQueen, 2008). We show that interactive activation can compute correct Bayesian posterior probabilities. We present a variant of the interactive activation model that produces outputs exactly corresponding to the correct posterior probabilities of letters given specified letter feature and context information. In the new variant of the model, inhibition between units within pools is replaced by selection of a single unit to be active, using the softmax function to assign probabilities to candidate alternatives. The model is fully interactive, yet the probability of a letter unit being activated is both provably and demonstrably equal to the posterior probability given the presented feature and context information.",>Pranav Khaitan>James L.

2010,Threat and anxiety interactively impair task switching ability,"Anxiety is associated with an attentional bias toward threat, yet the underlying mechanisms of this bias remain to be explored. Based on the assumption that anxiety selectively increases the strength of stimulus-driven attention to threat, we hypothesize that threatening stimuli and anxiety interactively impair the ability to re-allocate attention based on internal goals. We tested this assumption in a task-switching experiment with N=29 participants. Compared to task repetition, task switching requires goal-directed attention in order to reconfigure the task set. Both emotionally neutral and threatening stimuli were presented, and dispositional anxiety was measured using the STAI questionnaire. Results showed an interaction of anxiety and emotional quality of pre-switch stimuli on switch cost, independent of the emotional quality of the currently presented stimulus: switch cost was larger for more anxious participants, but only when the task switch was preceded by a threatening stimulus.",>Wolfgang Rauch>Marie Lauer-Schmaltz,">Goethe University Frankfurt, IDeA - Center for Individual Development and Adaptive Education>Goethe University Frankfurt",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0201/index.html

This study investigates these aspects of musical performance in the domain of popular music drumming, seeking to understand how drum patterns are constructed and produced by skilled players. It considers drum patterns from two perspectives: abstract grammaticality as revealed in frequency of sequences of drum sounds (via a probabilistic grammar), and also embodied and spatial cognition, as revealed in how patterns are produced by the player by motion sequences across the drumset. To investigate these issues, a combination of corpus analysis and experimental methods have been employed. Results to date indicate that production of drum patterns is based partly on articulatory constraints (ease of production), but also on a cognitive or acoustic attribute of contrastiveness.",>Richard Ashley,>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0202/index.html
2010,About the Validity of Computer Models in Cognitive Science,"Many cognitive models are evaluated by implementing an artificial system a program, a robot that performs the concrete task that the model is addressing. Success in task performance by the program is considered a proof of the adequacy of the cognitive model proposed. However, this is not a valid inference in general. The reason is that the transformation of the model from a textual or graphical form into a computer implementation is not transparent. This implies that phenomena and properties observed in the program cannot be predicated of the model. The reason for the lack of transparency is that models are not expressed using a rigorous language and that transformations into implementations arent rigorous either. Hacks are introduced during the construction of the program to make it work and they are not taken back into the model, hence invalidating the model-implementation relation.",>Ricardo Sanz>Carlos Hernández>Jaime Gómez>Guadalupe Sánchez>Adolfo Hernando,>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0203/index.html

Strangely, the relationship between WMC and the Tower of Hanoi task, a classic problem in Cognitive Psychology, has yet to be firmly established. Many studies have failed to find the suspected relationship and those that have identified a relationship have almost universally used spatial-modality measures of WMC. These results fail to differentiate between whether it was an individual's WMC or spatial ability that predicted performance. As such, the goal of the current research was to investigate the complex relationship between WMC, spatial ability, and the Tower of Hanoi.

2010,"Causal Learning in Joint Activity: Comparing Collaborative, Active, and Passive Contexts","Childrens causal learning from intentional actions (i.e., interventions) can be dramatically affected by the psychological and social circumstances in which they are produced. A context fundamental to childrens learning across many domains is joint activity; however little is known about childrens causal learning with others. Collaborative settings with shared goals and action plans might facilitate childrens learning from their own and a partners coordinated actions (Sommerville & Hammond, 2007). Alternatively, childrens own interventions may be more informative than those produced by a partner (Kushnir, Wellman, & Gelman, 2009). To address these issues, young children learned about simple causal systems via interventions performed: 1) by themselves, 2) by an experimenter, or 3) jointly with an experimenter. Childrens subsequent causal knowledge, source-memory, and free play are compared across these collaborative contexts.

The effects of example modality, distance, and familiarity.","An important question in the cognitive science of design concerns the influence of environmental input on ideation processes. Prior work has demonstrated that analogizing over examples in the environment is a double-edged sword: examples can help designers come up with innovative designs, but variations in key properties can result in negative design outcomes (e.g., fixation). We investigated the influence of variations in presentation modality, analogical distance, and familiarity of provided design examples on ideation processes. Engineering students generated solution concepts for an engineering design problem with or without provided design examples (analogy groups vs. control group). Examples in the analogy groups were fully crossed by modality (pictures vs. text), distance (near vs. far), and familiarity (familiar vs. unfamiliar). Results indicate that designers familiarity with examples influence whether they suppress or promote innovation, regardless of modality or analogical distance.",>Joel Chan>Katherine Fu>Christian  Schunn>Kristin Wood>Jonathan  Cagan>Kenneth  Kotovsky,>University of Pittsburgh>Carnegie-Mellon University>University of Pittsburgh>University of Texas-Austin>Carnegie-Mellon University>Carnegie-Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0206/index.html
2010,False Recognition in the DRM-Paradigm reflects False Encoding,A thorny question is whether the high rate of false memories in the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm is due to encoding or retrieval processes. Previous work suggests a locus at encoding using the free recall task. Here we use a recognition task in which false memories have typically been associated with intrusions due to high levels of featural overlap between the test probe and the stored memories. We used the REM model to assess the expectations from a retrieval account and from an encoding account of false memories. These simulations show that (probabilistic) false encoding leads to exceptionally large standard deviations in memory strength that are shown in ROC curves. We tested and verified these predictions in an experiment using a divided attention paradigm. These findings suggest that high false alarm rate in a DRM-paradigm might not be as useful as a proxy for everyday false memories as previously supposed.,>Tamella M. Pettitt>Eddy J.

2010,"Monday is before Tuesday in speech, but left of Tuesday in gesture.","Do English speakers gesture about time the same way they talk about it? In spoken English, time appears to flow along the sagittal (front/back) axis: we look forward to the future and back on the past. Yet, when English speakers produce spontaneous gestures they often use the lateral axis, gesturing leftward for earlier times and rightward for later times, consistent with the flow of time on calendars and graphs. Here we show that speakers spatialize time on the lateral axis overwhelmingly more often than on the sagittal axis in spontaneous co-speech gestures. This is true despite the prevalence of spoken front/back metaphors and complete absence of left/right metaphors for time in spoken language. Interestingly, front-back gestures, though rare, were more common during deictic language, consistent with predictions based on signed languages. We propose possible pragmatic, kinematic, and mnemonic motivations for this dissociation between spatio-temporal metaphors in speech and gesture.",>Daniel Casasanto>Kyle Jasmin,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour >Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0208/index.html
2010,Enhanced visuo-spatial learning and memory effects in time-space synesthesia,"Time-space synesthetes report that they consistently experience time events, such as the months of the year, as having a specific spatial layout. Two studies compared 11 synesthetes and 41 non-synesthetic controls ability to memorize novel spatial calendars. Both studies revealed better memory performance (quicker reaction times and higher consistency) in synesthetes than controls, even if the memorized calendar was specifically designed to conflict with synesthetes' own involuntarily experienced calendar. Furthermore, an additional group of controls performance was better for counterclockwise than clockwise calendars, perhaps due to less interference with conventional mappings. These findings suggest that time-space synesthetes enhanced visuo-spatial memory abilities may underlie the emergence of time-space synesthesia, as people with a greater capacity to learn mappings between spatial forms and temporal sequences might be more likely to think of months of the year in terms of idiosyncratic shapes, while others might be more reliant on culturally established mapping schemes.",>Ursina Teuscher>David Brang>Vilayanur S.

An upper-level performance limit was established by analyzing journal articles written by the students faculty mentors. Students were compared to mentors in terms of the frequency of use of higher-level (e.g., stating a hypothesis) and lower-level discourse functions (e.g., stating background information), as well as with respect to the syntactic complexity of their respective sentence constructions. In self-reports of research knowledge and skills, students express gains that are not evident in their papers, suggesting that the written form poses specific challenges.

Posture is known to communicate certain affective states; however, it is of interest whether posture may elicit an attentional state that can influence performance on a task. To address this question, participants were first instructed to sit focused or unfocused while conducting a word recall and visual search task. Results showed a benefit of being in a focused posture in the visual search task as well as consistent postures adopted within groups. However, when participants were given instructions on how to sit, without explicit mention of focused or unfocused postures, no performance differences were observed. These results suggest that posture alone may not be enough to elicit particular attentional states, at least not in the tasks we used.

2010,Similarity avoidance in processing consonants: apparent exceptions from Polynesian languages,"In languages as diverse as English, Arabic, and Russian, the cooccurrence frequency of two consonants can be predicted from a gradient measure of the similarity of the phonological make-up of the two consonants. An argument for the role of phonological similarity in these languages is that it tends to be the case that sound classes with more members have weaker cooccurrence restrictions than classes with fewer members. More members require more contrasts, which reduces similarity. In Arabic, there are weaker restrictions on coronals (n=11) than labials (n=4) because coronals exhibit more contrasts. However, there are a number of well-documented Polynesian languages (Maori, Hawaiian, Tongan) were the reverse is true: there are more labial consonants than coronals, but there are stronger cooccurrence restrictions on labials than coronals.

2010,Cross-Situational Word Learning in Bilinguals,"Recent research indicates that fluency in more than one language has consequences for fundamental aspects of the cognitive system beyond that of speaking two languages. Specifically, a now growing body of research shows speakers of two languages can allocate their attention more efficiently than speakers of one language in nonlinguistic tasks (e.g., Bialystok, Klein, Craik, & Viswanathan, 2004). In addition, bilingualism has also been shown to promote abilities in the linguistic domain, such as the ability to learn novel words better than monolinguals (Kaushanskaya and Marian, 2009). In the present study, we investigated how the efficiency of attentional allocation and the ability to learn novel words may interact and affect performance in Yu and Smiths (2007) cross-situational word learning paradigm. Monolingual and bilingual adults learning of 18 novel words using this paradigm were examined, and results help to better understand the effects of bilingualism on cognition.",>Viridiana  Benitez>Linda B.

The participant engaged in a think-aloud procedure as he composed an expository paper, and his transcribed verbalizations were then analyzed for metacognitive strategy use. The strategies were organized into a taxonomy by means of Spradley's domain and taxonomic analysis. Results indicated that the participant advanced the writing process by employing five major types or domains of strategies. They are: (a) planning discourse/thinking, (b) evaluating discourse/thinking, (c) recognizing difficulty with discourse/thinking, (d) responding to difficulty with discourse/thinking, and (e) repairing discourse/thinking.

We examined how different methods for developing procedural flexibility affected novices learning equation solving. Students (N = 198) were assigned to one of three conditions that differed in whether multiple procedures were introduced immediately or after practice with one procedure (no delay vs. delay) and in whether comparison of examples was supported. Students in the no delay condition had greater procedural flexibility and accuracy than students in either delay condition, regardless of whether they compared examples. Differences in students' explanations during the intervention suggest reasons for the benefits of immediate introduction to multiple procedures. Students in the no delay condition more frequently compared and evaluated efficiency of procedures than students in delay conditions. They also more frequently used efficient procedures during the intervention. Immediate introduction to multiple procedures supports attention to and adaption of efficient procedures, which benefits flexibility.",>Kelley Durkin>Bethany Rittle-Johnson>Jon Star,>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0215/index.html

2010,Nouns are more stable than Verbs: Patterns of semantic change in 19th century English,"It has been hypothesized in the literature that nouns are acquired earlier than verbs because they are more concrete and involve fewer relations. This hypothesis also predicts that the meaning of nouns should be more stable over time and across speakers. In this paper I use Latent Semantic Analysis of a 19th century literary corpus containing works from British and American authors to test this prediction. I examined the variability in the vector representations of frequently used nouns and verbs based on the culture of the author and the time period. The results show the nouns vary less than verbs between the two cultures and across time. Moreover, these differences still exist when the concreteness of the words is taken into account. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the relational nature of verbs contributes to their difficulty and variability beyond its effect on the verbs concreteness.",>Eyal Sagi,>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0217/index.html
2010,Context in distributed situated cognition,"Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can be understood as a research effort towards physical environments that can use artificial intelligence techniques, in order to serve people in an intelligent, pro-active manner. AmI environments provide a unique, novel platform for studying and applying concepts of situated cognition and self-organization. In particular, we find that representations of context are crucial for AmI systems to perform these tasks. We follow the idea that the notion of context plays a central role with respect to economy, evolution, and architecture of cognitive systems. In particular, context can be understood to bridge the gap between the sensory stream and goal-directed reasoning. We present a logical language in which contexts, and not objects, properties, or propositions, are the primary entities. We show that, from this logical formalism, a corresponding symbolic-connectionist hybrid model of distributed, situated cognition can be derived.",>Hedda Rahel Schmidtke>Michael Beigl,>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT),https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0218/index.html
2010,Exploring Active Learning in a Bayesian Framework,"Bayesian approaches provide a framework for models of active learning--learning in which stimuli are actively probed to disambiguate potential beliefs regarding outcomes. Within a Bayesian framework, uncertainty across beliefs is inherently represented and expected uncertainty reductions for candidate stimuli can be evaluated. Bayesian active learning models offer the prediction that an active learner would select the stimuli for which the expected uncertainty across all hypotheses is minimized. This research contrasts four possible hypothesis spaces for active learning consisting of two simple cue-combination models and two possible priors. An automated search of associative learning structures for which the models make maximally different predictions was performed. Participants were tested on these same structures in an allergy diagnosis context and were asked which cues they would find the most informative to learn about; i.e., their active learning preferences were assessed. Model and prior combinations that best mimic human active learning are discussed.",>Stephen Denton>John Kruschke,">Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, , Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0219/index.html
2010,Linguistic Mediation of Visual Search: The effects of relative timing of speech and display,"Recent studies have shown that instead of a dichotomy between parallel and serial search strategies, in many instances we see a combination of both search strategies utilized. Consequently, computational models and theoretical accounts of visual search processing have evolved from traditional parallel or serial descriptions to labels of efficient and inefficient. In the first experiment, we replicate previous findings regarding incremental spoken language comprehension on visual search processing utilizing a between subjects design. Next, a series of four experiments further explore the subtle timing of the influence of real-time language processing on visual search. The results provide further evidence toward understanding linguistically mediated influences on real-time visual search processing and support an interactive processing account of visual search and language comprehension.",>Eric Chiu>Michael Spivey,">University of California, Merced (UCM)>University of California, Merced (UCM)",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0220/index.html
2010,Belief bias in judgments of sample-size adequacy,"Previous research on syllogistic logical reasoning indicates that people are more likely to judge an argument as valid when they believe the argument's conclusion to be true. The present research assessed whether belief bias would also occur in intuitive statistical judgment. There were two versions of a judgment scenario (varying between subjects). Version A described an observer who, based on 100 observations, draws the conclusion that most Americans are left-handed. Version B was like A except the conclusion was that most Americans are right-handed. Participants' task was to assess the degree to which 100 is a sufficiently large sample to support a confident conclusion (i.e., that Americans tend to be left-handed, or that Americans tend to be right-handed). Participants judged the sample size to be more adequate when the argument conclusion was presumably believed (i.e., that ""most Americans are right-handed"") than when the conclusion was ""most Americans are left-handed.""",>Richard Anderson>Leisha Colyn>Beth Hartzler,>Bowling Green State University>Bowling Green State University>Bowling Green State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0221/index.html
2010,Must analysis of meaning follow analysis of form? A time course analysis,"Many models of word recognition assume that processing proceeds sequentially from analysis of form to analysis of meaning. In the context of morphological processing, some interpret the apparent absence of differences in recognition latencies to targets (RAT) in form and semantically similar (ratty-RAT) and in form similar and semantically dissimilar (ratify-RAT) prime contexts as consistent with this claim. We examined the time course over which degree of semantic similarity between morphologically related pairs influences recognition in the forward masked priming variant of the lexical decision paradigm. Across a range of SOAs., latencies were significantly faster after semantically similar than dissimilar primes, Results limit the scope of form-then-semantics models of recognition and demonstrate that semantic context influences even the very early stages of recognition.",>Laurie Beth Feldman>Fermín Moscoso del Prado Martín>Patrick A OConnor,">The University at Albany, SUNY & Haskins Labs>CNRS & Université de Provence, France>The University at Albany, SUNY & Haskins Labs",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0222/index.html
2010,Learning Cross-Modal Contingencies through Attentional Cues,"Infants must develop attentional mechanisms that support extraction of relevant information from a cluttered world. Though both social and non-social cues shift infants attention, Wu and Kirkham (accepted) showed they produce qualitatively different learning effects in 4 and 8-month-old infants. While both types of cues led infants to attend preferentially to the relevant locations during training, cross-modal contingencies were learned only by older infants exposed to social cues. In this work, we analyzed the eye movement of these infants to shed light on the underlying attentional processes elicited by these cues. Using a dual-process model to link learning to looking (Yurovsky, Hidaka, Yu, & Smith, Cogsci Conference 2010), we characterized each infant's underlying learning function and used these functions to predict individual test results. We can thus understand the impact of social and non-social cues by examining how cue-elicited differences in exploratory behavior cascade into differences in learning.",>Daniel Yurovsky>Rachel Wu>Natasha Kirkham>Chen Yu,">Indiana University>Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0223/index.html
2010,The Effects of Alcohol on Working Memory and Change Detection,"The prevailing account of how alcohol affects attention suggests that intoxication reduces attentional focus and capacity. To better understand presumed cognitive consequences of intoxication, the present study tested the effects of moderate intoxication (.07 BAC) on both change blindness and complex span tasks. Change blindness tasks require finding a small change across alternating versions of a scene. Complex span tasks consist of interleaved processing and storage components. As expected, intoxication significantly decreased performance on the complex span tasks. But, surprisingly, it improved performance on the change blindness task. The results are interpreted as evidence that intoxication decreases attentional control, and causes a more diffuse attentional state. This can harm performance on some tasks where attentional control or focus are required, but may actually facilitate performance on other tasks.",>Gregory Colflesh>Andrew Jarosz>Jennifer  Wiley,>Georgia Institute of Technology>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Illinois at Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0224/index.html
2010,Effects of the Exploration Perspective on Pointing Accuracy,"Abstract: We examined the influence of the perspective during exploration on the ability of subjects to point correctly to memorized targets in a virtual 3D environment. This environment consisted of a two-storied factory building with 32 machines on the ground floor. Four machines were marked as targets. Eight trials were conducted in each of the four different perspectives: map view from above, four different views from the corners, perceiving the environment as a person walking through it, and following an avatar through the environment. Subsequently, participants were asked to point to the four targets from the upper floor. We expected the best performance in the map view as all information is given in a single reference frame and a rotation suffices for pointing. Surprisingly, eleven of the nineteen participants performed best in conditions different from the most straightforward. This finding indicates that different memorization strategies were used by different persons.",>Julia Frankenstein>Manuel Vidal>Michael Rouillé>Stéphane Donikian>Mohamed Zaoui>Alain Berthoz,">University of Freiburg>College de France, Paris>IRISA / INRIA Rennes>IRISA / INRIA Rennes>College de France, Paris>College de France, Paris",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0225/index.html
2010,The Effect of Processing Type on Re-Categorization,"The effect of processing type on the process of overriding prior experience and learning  restructuring  was examined within a categorization paradigm. Participants were trained to categorize either explicitly, implicitly or received no training. Explicit training encouraged participants to use hypothesis-testing while implicit training encouraged categorizing via intuition or gut instinct. Participants then worked on a modified categorization task in which they learned an initial ""misconception"" category and later had to restructure their representation to learn a target category. Participants were able to successfully learn the misconception and restructure to the target. Data suggest that increased category complexity results in a longer learning period that leads to the generation of a category representation that is more accessible and more readily restructured. The complexity effect is driven by similar performance across the different training types. The experimental and real-world implications for the interplay between stimuli complexity and processing type are addressed.",>David G.

2010,Fractioning Factors that Influence Phonological Word Form Learning,"Although learning of phonological word forms is important for mastering a language, little is known about the factors influencing it. We addressed this question by comparing phonological word form learning in two situations: learning novel word forms as the labels for referents (deliberate word learning); and learning novel word forms through incidental exposures to the word forms alone, without any referents (incidental word form learning). Phonological word form learning as measured by stem completion ability was found to be better in the former than in the latter situation (Experiment 1). Experiment 2 found that deliberate memorization of word forms, even without any referents, also yielded better stem completion ability than purely incidental learning. These results suggest that incidental word form learning may not yield full mastery of word forms, and that deliberate learning may be a necessary component for such mastery.",>Libo Zhao>Prahlad Gupta,">Department of Psychology, University of Iowa>Department of Psychology, University of Iowa",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0227/index.html
2010,Large differences in the distribution of instances of common object-based categories in early childhood,"Few studies have documented the examples of common early-learned object-based categories children actually encounter. This study asked parents (N = 10) to record, using a digital camera, the concrete instances their children saw (M = 16 mo). For five days, if an object was labeled with one of the nouns inside a pre-determined list of eight nouns, parents were to take a photoour final dataset consisted of 700 photos. We coded the contents of each photo as: 3D real object, 3D realistic toy, 3D simple shape toy, 2D realistic object, and 2D simple shape. Our results show large differences between categories in terms of type of exemplars: mostly composed of 3D real objects, with a mixture of 3D and 2D variability, or only experienced as 2D images. These results are relevant to theories of visual object categorizatione.g. in understanding viewpoint invariance, or perception of abstract structural shape.",>Alfredo F. Pereira>Karin H.

2010,Phonetic symbolism for size and shape,"Many previous studies of phonetic symbolism, wherein the sounds of a word convey the referent's attributes, have confounded multiple attributes such as size and shape. In the current study, participants viewed novel objects of varying size and shape and were asked to rate the appropriateness of a spoken non-word as a name for the object. Size and shape interacted (e.g., higher ratings were given for names with front vowels like /i/ when the object was small and spiky), and both spiky and round objects were phonetically marked. However, participants tended to use phonemes to mark size only when the object is large. This suggests that marking via phonemes should not be assumed to simultaneously mark all physical properties of the object (i.e., both size and shape). Consequently, phonetic symbolism of physical properties may not correlate as neatly with gesture as has previously been thought.",>Patrick Thompson>Zachary Estes,>University of Warwick>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0229/index.html

We discuss the embodied instruction of abstract symbols in mathematics and suggest that the nature of programming a video game (Fadjo et al., 2009a, 2009b) provides adequate grounding (Barsalou, 2008) for the instruction of abstract conditional statements. We suggest that an embodied form of instruction integrates the actions prevalent in two-dimensional video games with the instruction of abstract programming concepts.

2010,Decision-Making in Older Adults: Sometimes Older is Wiser,"We examined the performance of younger and older adults in a dynamic decision making task that required exploring long-term increasing options that had worse short term gains, but that eventually yielded higher rewards. Results indicate that older adults are more willing to sample the long-term increasing option earlier in the task than the Younger adults. We employed a model-based approach that modified a simple reinforcement learning model to allow for biases to stay or switch following a response (e.g. Otto et al., in press). Using this approach we were able to characterize exploration of alternative options or exploitation of the best option as targeted or untargeted responding. We found that Older adults were best fit by the targeted exploration model. This suggests that while Younger adults tend to repeatedly select short-term advantageous options, Older adults engage in greater exploration of the decision space, and this leads to better performance.",>Darrell Worthy>W.

2010,Coordination dynamics in speech and lexical semantics,"Variations in individual human behavior are intrinsically long-range correlated (i.e. 1/f noise). These correlations may reflect interdependence (i.e. coordination) among components at various scales of structure and dynamics (e.g., neurons, cortical columns, brain areas, brain-body interactions). Two experiments tested whether long-range correlations emerge when two people interact. In experiment 1, perceptual-motor coordination was invoked by instructing participant pairs to coordinate uttering the word mom in alternation with key taps. In experiment 2, semantic coordination was invoked by alternating free word associations (e.g. one says cat, the other says dog, first says collar, second says shirt, and so on). Fluctuations in series of mom-tap intervals were long-range correlated. Long-range correlations were also found in semantics fluctuations of free word associations, the latter being weaker and derived from lexical co-occurrence statistics. Results indicate that common principles of coordination apply across individual and dyadic scales of perceptual-motor and cognitive performances.",>Christopher Kello>Theo Rhodes>Geoff Hollis>Bryan Kerster,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced>University of Cincinnati>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0232/index.html

These studies investigate how children use past accuracy to differentially trust people for causal learning. Across two studies, we found that children (Mean age = 4 years, 3 months; SD = 4 months) would differentially trust an accurate (versus inaccurate or ignorant) labeler for learning a novel causal function but not for learning a novel causal mechanism. However, when an accurate labeler was pitted against a causal expert, children trusted the expert with both causal mechanism and causal function. These studies demonstrate that children show selective trust of accurate labelers depending on the availability of sources with causal expertise. Thus, children are sensitive to domains of knowledge and can use them to request information from the most appropriate source.",>Chris Vredenburgh>Lauren  Schneider>Andy  Hsia >Tamar  Kushnir,>Cornell University>Cornell University>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0233/index.html

However, it is often possible to also use an overhead perspective or the perspective of a communication partner, especially in a communication system using 3DCG space, in addition to our own first-person view. This study focused on the effects of these three perspectives on understanding projective spatial terms in a 3DCG system. In this experiment, we used four projective spatial terms (front, back, left, and right) and 3DCG stimuli based on three views (a participant's first-person view, an overhead view, and a communication partner's view). We investigated how the three views influenced understanding of the spatial terms. The results show that an overhead view had little effect on understanding of the spatial terms and that the communication partner's view had considerable effect on such understanding.",>Takatsugu Kojima,>Kyoto University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0234/index.html

Two groups saw an actor repeatedly raise and lower a box. In one group, the box was moved with a hidden handle. In the other group, a box with no handle was grasped along the hidden back face and repeatedly raised and lowered. Following this familiarization, the box was rotated 90 degrees either to reveal a structure consistent or to reveal a structure inconsistent with that suggested by the initial action. Patterns of looking between familiarization and test trials differed for the two familiarization groups, suggesting that 9-month-old infants can infer certain details of an objects structure from human action.",>Stephen Killingsworth>John Jacobson>Megan Saylor,">Peabody College, Vanderbilt University>Peabody College, Vanderbilt University>Peabody College, Vanderbilt University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0235/index.html
2010,Social Indexing: How the People Around Us Aid Cognition,"We hypothesise the existence of a specific attentional mechanism, social indexing, that directs gaze towards people in our environment who are relevant to moment by moment cognitive processing. Whilst Festinger (1954) proposed that individuals will depend upon and conform to similar others in times of uncertainty, the social indexing hypothesis posits that individuals will actively seek out information from those we perceive to be able to provide socially relevant information. Such an attentional mechanism would allow cognition to be situated in both the physical and social world (Hutchins, 1995). In an early demonstration, Crosby, Monin and Richardson (2008) showed that gaze is directed towards the target of potentially offensive remarks when they might provide an informative response. We discuss whether these results extend to both positive and negative remarks, and whether participants confidence in their ability to interpret social situations will result in more or less social indexing behaviour.",>Chris N.H.

In order to determine how students ability affects the peer-review process, students writing ability (e.g., high-ability versus low-ability) was first determined. Then students were randomly assigned to review either four high-ability peers papers or four low-ability peers papers. In return, they received feedback from either four high-ability peers or four low-ability peers. The quality of students second draft of their first paper and the quality of the first draft of a second paper were analyzed to determine whether students learning was affected by the feedback they provided to high-ability versus low-ability students and by the feedback they received from high-ability versus low-ability students.

Eye movements in a social interaction reveal effects of speaking and social status,"Human visual attention tends to operate in an environment that is complex, dynamic and social. However, experimental investigations of where people direct their attention often neglect these factors. In our research, we recorded people making decisions in groups of 3 and then showed video clips of these situations to new participants while monitoring their eye movements. This provided a rich record of how people distributed their gaze on a moment-by-moment basis. Observers tended to look at the person who was talking at any one time, and they fixated this person slightly before they started to speak. Higher-level social attributions also had an effect: people who were rated as having high social status were gazed at more often, over and above the effects of speaking. These effects show that the gaze system is extremely sensitive to the complexities and dynamics of the current social context.",>Tom Foulsham>Joey Cheng>Jessica Tracy>Joseph Henrich>Alan Kingstone,>University of British Columbia (UBC)>University of British Columbia (UBC)>University of British Columbia (UBC)>University of British Columbia (UBC)>University of British Columbia (UBC),https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0238/index.html

In this presentation we focus on the application of analogical learning principles to two popular middle school science curricula. Analogical learning through comparison is a powerful activity for facilitating the acquisition of critical features and concepts underlying concrete examples and preparing students for future learning. We instantiated these principles by creating contrasting cases to introduce abstract science concepts in conceptually driven lessons that could easily be inserted into existing curricula. We assessed the effectiveness of this intervention with tests targeting both the concepts that were covered in the cases as well as transfer concepts taught later in the curriculum.

2010,Modeling age of exposure in L2 learning of vowel categories,"Age of exposure is known to be an important indicator of second language proficiency. Native-like phonological proficiency is attained only by learners exposed at the earliest ages. This paper examines one account of age-of-exposure effects. Two computational models (a mixture of Gaussians and a neural network) were trained without supervision on F1 and F2 tokens based on production data from two different vowel systems (Quichua and Spanish; Guion, 2003). Both models learn the individual phonological systems when trained on monolingual distributions. When exposed to bilingual data, both models also achieve varying degrees of success depending on when the second language (Spanish) is introduced in training, paralleling data from bilingual speakers with different ages of acquisition (Guion, 2003). This demonstrates that learners may be restricted in learning a second language not because of a biological critical period, but by the commitments that the system has already made to the first language.",>Meghan Clayards>Joseph Toscano,>McGill University>University of Iowa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0240/index.html

The present work examined what people with different levels of virology expertise think and believe about viruses. We conducted detailed, semi-structured interviews about virus infection, replication, transmission, and other topics with a group of middle-school students, science teachers, and expert virologists. Participants responses were coded for content and used to establish their mental models for several key topics (cf. Hmelo-Silver & Pfeffer, 2004). Analyses revealed that the experts mental models were greatest in depth and breadth. Many of the studentsand several teacherspossessed scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies in their mental models.

2010,Facilitating Educator Evaluation of Online Instructional Materials: Does Conceptual Browsing Impact Cognitive Processing?,"A key challenge for beginning educators is finding high-quality online materials that will support deep learning in their classrooms. Identifying and evaluating effective digital resources requires careful attention to the match between domain learning goals and the conceptual information contained in resources, but preservice teachers often lack strong prior knowledge that would facilitate such processing. Conceptual browsing interfaces may support deeper cognitive processing by providing a visual representation of the conceptual relationships between domain ideas and by providing a direct retrieval mechanism to find specific online resources related to key domain ideas. Using a combined think-aloud and eye-tracking study, we are examining the effects of conceptual browsing vs. keyword searching on the cognitive processes of preservice teachers performing educational tasks.

2010,Are Hindu-Arabic Numerals Concrete or Abstract Symbols?,"Much recent experimental work has investigated the comparative merits of concrete versus abstract instantiations of to-be-learned concepts for promoting learning and transfer in complex domains. A critical question, however, is what exactly counts as a concrete instantiation. Using a design similar to that of Sloutsky, Kaminski, & Heckler (2005), the current experiments provide findings that suggest that Arabic numerals have effects that parallel those of perceptually concrete instantiations when used to illustrate the domain of modular arithmetic. Specifically, numerals can be used to speed initial learning within the domain, but impede transfer relative to more abstract instantiations of the same underlying content. Moreover, these effects can be moderated by subtle warm-up tasks that affect the degree to which these numerals activate prior arithmetic schemas. These results suggest that the current conception of concrete should be expanded to include representations typically thought to lie outside of the realm of concrete.",>Percival Matthews,>Vanderbilt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0243/index.html

There is less research, however, regarding how example order affects categorization skill. Might the order of training examples affect categorization even after the concepts have been learned? Participants were trained to categorize sets of playing cards into the best possible poker hand. Training followed either a blocked (the best hand remained the same for contiguous trials) or a mixed order (the best hand did not repeat more than twice in a row). Preliminary results suggest that example order affects categorization reaction time (RT) during acquisition training: the blocked order reduced RT. This trend reversed, however, during transfer trials: the mixed group had lower RT. These findings suggest that example order plays a role in developing categorization skill.

2010,Semantics in the wild: Context-sensitive inferences about mammals,"Several accounts of semantic representation have relied on a contextually insensitive similarity space, including recent structured probabilistic approaches (Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2009). However, evidence for these models relies on participants' inferences about a particular kind of property, namely, biological properties. We show that the training set used to extract a single tree structure by Kemp and Tenenbaum (2009) in fact contains additional structure in the relations between properties of different types. Moreover, participants who are asked to make inferences about different kinds of properties (biology, diet, habitat) show generalization differences that reflect this additional structure. We suggest that models of semantic representation must be able to dynamically adjust their representations in a context-sensitive manner, and we will present simulation results using a model that can do so.",>Jeremy Glick>James McClelland,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0245/index.html
2010,Judgements of relative order: Mechanisms underlying subspan versus supraspan lists,"Judging the relative order of materials is a core function of human memory. In short, subspan consonant lists with immediate judgments of relative recency (JOR), instruction wording (""which item was presented earlier?"" versus ""which item was presented later?"") could flip around memory search direction (Chan et al., 2009). We wondered whether instruction wording could have an analogous influence on the JOR judgement in supraspan lists. However, supraspan lists typically show a very different behavioural pattern - distance effects (e.g., Yntema & Trask, 1963). Our participants performed JOR judgements on ""short"" (LL=8) supraspan noun lists. We evaluate whether it is possible to reconcile the subspan and supraspan data by assuming that the judgement in both sub- and supra-span regimes are influenced by the same factors, positional discriminability and attentional bias across serial positions, and that speed-accuracy tradeoffs combined with ceiling in subspan lists account for the observed qualitative differences in behaviour.",>Yang Liu>Michelle Chan>Jeremy Caplan,>University of Alberta>University of Alberta>University of Alberta,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0246/index.html
2010,"Verb-body part associations across users of English, Telugu, and Hindi","Verb-body part association data were obtained from 36 adults using English (a second language), and Telugu and Hindi (as first languages). A set of 100 action verbs in English (same as those used in Maouene et al, 2008) and their equivalents in Telugu and Hindi served as target stimuli. Three groups of young adults (12 per language) provided written responses to action verbs printed in each language. There was greater agreement for verbs involving actions of hand, mouth and leg compared to the other body parts across all three languages. However, there were some language specific findings with respect to number of unique body parts specified, and the number of body parts required to cover 80% of the target verbs.

2010,Reasoning in pedagogical versus deceptive situations,"The majority of human learning occurs in social situations. In such situations, people may be cooperating or competing, and these different intentions may affect what kinds of information people exchange. Recently, Shafto and Goodman (2008) formalized a Bayesian model of reasoning in pedagogical situations -- situations in which a knowledgeable teacher cooperates with a learner. This and other research suggests that individuals understand what information is more helpful and can use the knowledge of a person's intent to facilitate learning. We extend this model to apply to both the pedagogical and deceptive situations. We present a new experiment comparing reasoning in pedagogical and deceptive games. In the experiment, participants play the role of teacher/deceiver or learner/reasoner in a series of games. The results show that people converge to strategies predicted by the model, that people's behavior differs in pedagogical and deceptive conditions, and an analysis of individual games reveals interesting dynamics. We discuss the implications for models of learning in social situations.",>Russell Warner>Todd Stoess>Patrick Shafto,>University of Louisville>University of Louisville>University of Louisville,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0248/index.html
2010,Interactions Between the Fast and Slow Mental Processes,"Our actions seem to be controlled by two separate types of mental processes: one fast, automatic, and unconscious and one slow, deliberate, and conscious. With the attention in the literature focused on the characteristics of the two processes and whether to include emotions, we do not find any discussion of how they interact. We present evidence that the slower process is not able to perceive the operation of faster process, but it can perceive the environmental stimulus common to both processes and the response of the faster process. It can then generate its own more deliberate response, possibly contrary to the faster processs response. We also provide evidence that the slower process is sometimes able to inhibit the fast processs response, but with effort. We present common experiences as well as cognitive theory and neurological studies in support of our description theory of the interactions of the two processes.",>William Kennedy>Magdalena Bugajska,>George Mason University>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0249/index.html
2010,Word Length Effects and the Serial vs. Parallel Debate in Connectionist Models of Reading Aloud,"In reading aloud, naming latency (i.e., reaction time) increases linearly as the number of written symbols in a word increases (e.g., Rastle, Havelka, Wydell, Coltheart, & Besner, 2009). Advocates of dual-route models have argued that these effects can be accounted for by connectionist models that have a serial processing component, but not by models that are completely parallel when a single fixation is assumed. However, this conclusion is valid only for the specific assumptions made in parallel models implemented to date, and is not valid more generally. As Townsend and colleagues (Snodgrass & Townsend, 1980; Townsend, 1972) have argued, parallel models can mimic linearly increasing RTs as the number of items to be processed increases if stochastic processing times, limited processing capacity (i.e., attention), and a self-terminating stopping rule (i.e., the criterion to initiate articulation corresponding to the segment) are considered.",>Alan H.

2010,Differential effects of dopamine dysfunction on context usage in people with autism and schizophrenia: A computational exploration,"The ability to utilize contextual information in a flexible manner is vital for the successful navigation of our lives. People with autism demonstrate serious problems on tasks requiring the integration of contextual information across experiences. One such task is the determination of the proper meaning of an ambiguous word in a sentence. Homographs are words with one spelling, but different meanings, such as ""bow"" and ""tear"". People with autism appear unable to utilize sentential context in order to determine the correct meaning of a homograph. Instead, they rely on the statistically most frequent meaning. We present a neurocomputational model that suggests that these difficulties arise from a deficit in the flexible updating of attentional control, driven by dysfunctional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the midbrain dopamine system. This work is compared to a previous computational account of the effects of abnormal dopamine levels on context processing difficulties in schizophrenia.",>Trent Kriete>David C.

2010,Can Statistics Change our Minds? The Role of Causal Explanation in Accommodation of Base Rate Statistics,"Can statistics change our minds? Base rate statistics are taken into account when they are causally relevant (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman, 1980). However, evidence is mixed on whether causally-relevant statistics can drive revision of existing beliefs: Hagmayer and Sloman (2009) found that those providing direct causal explanations for statistical patterns were more likely to recommend action than those providing incidental explanations. By contrast, Hewstone et al. (1988) found that the causal relevance of statistics only affected assignment of guilt when consistent with ones prejudices. To examine the extent to which beliefs can be revised due to statistics, we asked participants about statistics before and after feedback. Specifically, participants estimated quantities (e.g., U.S. traffic fatalities), provided explanations for trends in those statistics, and indicated what action they would take. We then provided actual statistics, and either a direct or incidental causal explanation for trendsand observed changes in actions participants would take.",>Edward Munnich>Saera Khan>Melissa Latham>Michelle Brewer>Valesia Ho>Sierra Walton,>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0252/index.html
2010,Handedness and Hand Used Differentially Affect Object Facing,"When producing line drawings of common objects with an intrinsic front, directional biases are observed in starting location, stroke direction, and figure orientation, Previous studies of drawing directionality have predominantly examined right handers and/or have considered dominant hand drawing performance only. By contrast, the present study compared drawing directionality of right vs. left handers drawing objects with their dominant and non-dominant hands. Object facing direction was found to differ significantly as a function of handedness and hand used. Whereas right handers orientation preference was generally unaffected by hand used to draw, left handers tended to show a stronger right-facing bias when drawing with their left hand than when drawing with their right hand. The latter finding is consistent with a biomechanical account in terms of hand movement asymmetries. Additional accounts of drawing asymmetries are addressed and their implications explored for current views on the relationship between perception, cognition, and action.",>Jyotsna Vaid>Hsin-Chin Chen>Rebecca  Rhodes>Sumeyra Tosun,">Texas A&M; University, College Station>National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor>Texas A&M; University, College Station",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0253/index.html
2010,Experience word learning predicts children's ability to generalize novel labels,"Recent research has suggested that rapid world learning develops within specific categorical domains as the result of previous within the domain (Thom & Sandhofer, 2009). The current studies further examined the relationship between childrens previous experience learning words within a category and their ability to extend additional words within the category. In Study 1, childrens extension of novel labels was compared across three common categories in relation to their existing vocabulary size within that category. In Study 2, children were trained in a greater or fewer number of category exemplars in two common categories, then tested in their ability to generalize new labels within each of these categories. Preliminary results indicate that greater experience learning words within a category predicts better extension within that category, but not in other categories, suggesting the development of rapid word learning is domain-specific, and occurs as the result of experience learning words within each category.",>Emily Thom>Catherine Sandhofer,">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0254/index.html
2010,A Biologically Plausible Account of the Computational Utility of Consciousness,"According to Mathis and Mozer (1996), visual awareness requires internal representations to be stable over time. They demonstrated that attractor dynamics in a hand-wired, abstract, connectionist model could both produce this stability and also explain behavioral differences between conditions of subliminal and supraliminal stimulus presentation. One such demonstration involved a lexical decision study by Marcel (1980), in which conscious perception of an ambiguous prime word, disambiguated by previous context, sped lexical decision of a subsequent target word only when the target was related to the context-cued meaning of the prime. In contrast, subliminal presentation of the prime produced facilitation for targets related to either meaning of the prime. Here, we show that the attractor dynamics needed to explain this effect naturally arise from the balance of excitatory and inhibitory connections in cortex, as modeled in the biologically constrained Leabra framework, providing some neuroscientific support for this account of visual awareness.",>William B.

2010,Perceiving the Other during Joint Action,"The perceived vanishing point of a moving stimulus is displaced beyond the actual vanishing point. This forward displacement (FD) decreases with implied friction (i.e., the stimulus appears to move across a surface). The effect reverses when participants control stimulus movements (via right- and left-key presses) versus observe them. This reversal is consistent with economy-of-action (EOA) effects in which variables such as perceived pitch are influenced by the energy-demands implied by a stimulus (e.g., a steeper hill). The present poster presents experiments that reveal EOA effects when two participants control stimulus movements together, each having access to one of two control buttons. Specifically, FD increases across implied friction, regardless who controls the stimulus when it vanishes. Since participants are basically observers as the other participant controls the stimulus, the increase of FD during such observation indicates participants perceive the other-controlled stimulus movements in terms implied effort (i.e., EOA).",>Jerome Scott Jordan>Andrew Kenning>James  Clinton>Justin Durtschi>J.

Among such modelings, Hinton and Shalllice (1991) and Plaut (1996) lesioned recurrent neural networks and investigated the degree of recovery through retraining. However, many ways of brain damages has remained to be unresolved. The current works propose the method of constraints in which brain damages might occur. In order to understand the nature and variability of recovery in patients, we examined both simple three layerd perceptrons and attractor networks with lesions in various parts of networks, and observed recovery processes in retraining. The findings in this study revealed conditions to recover from brain damages and suggests good and proper ways of therapy in which therapists have to select training words to maximize generalization.",>Shin-ichi Asakawa>Yoshihiro Itaguchi,>Tokyo Woman's Christian University>Waseda University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0257/index.html
2010,Restructuring representations in analogy making by children: the role of cognitive flexibility,"In classical A:B::C:D analogies, it is often assumed that participants first find a relation between A and B, which is then transferred to C and D. By contrast, we hypothesized that the first interpretation of A-B must sometimes be later revised, given the nature of C and the D available in the solution set. We hypothesized that young children (5-6 year-olds) would encounter difficulties when restructuring is necessary because restructuring requires cognitive flexibility which is less developed in young children. In an A:B::C:D task, we compared analogies requiring restructuring with analogies that did not. We also compared analogies based on weakly semantically associated pairs (e.g., child-bed) with analogies based on strongly semantically associated pairs (e.g., dog-bone). Results revealed an interaction in which the difference between restructuring and no restructuring was significant only for analogies based on weak semantic associations.

2010,White- and Grey-Matter Damage Differentially Impair Learning and Generalization in a Computational Model of the Raven Matrices Task,"Many preterm neonates have white-matter damage (WMD, damaged connections between neurons) and grey matter-damage (GMD, dead neurons). These children are known to have lower IQs than their full-term peers, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. We designed a developmental connectionist model of the Raven Matrices IQ task in which (1) all neurons had intact output, simulating normal development, or (2) half the neurons had noisy output, simulating noisy transmission or WMD, or (3) half the neurons had no output, simulating cell death or GMD. We found that damage increased task error. Further, WMD was worse than GMD overall, yet GMD was at once worse for generalization problems not given in training and better for training problems. Our model is the first to simulate an effect of perinatal brain damage on a cognitive task, and predicts that different types of brain damage may lead to different cognitive impairments.",>Vincent G.

2010,Neural networks for word recognition: Is a hidden layer necessary?,"We study neural network models that learn location invariant orthographic representations for printed words. We compare two model architectures: with and without a hidden layer. We find that both architectures succeed in learning the training data and in capturing benchmark phenomena of skilled reading  transposed-letter and relative-position priming. Networks without a hidden layer use a strategy for identifying target words based on the presence of letters in the target word, but where letter contributions are modulated using the interaction between within-word position and within-slot location. This modulation allows networks to factor in some information about letter position, which is sufficient to segregate most anagrams. The hidden layer appears critical for success in a lexical decision task, i.e., sorting words from non-words. Networks with a hidden layer better succeed at correctly rejecting non-words than networks without a hidden layer. The latter tend to over-generalize and confuse non-words for words that share letters.",>Frederic Dandurand>Thomas Hannagan>Jonathan Grainger,>CNRS & Université de Provence>École Normale Supérieure>CNRS,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0260/index.html
2010,The dimensionality of episodic images,"Previous studies (Doxas, Dennis, & Oliver, 2010) show that natural language discourse exhibits a two-scale structure with a lower dimension at short distances and larger dimension at long distances. We attempt to search for the source of this constraint in the visual input that goes into forming episodic experiences in human beings. This information is assumed to be approximated well by images captured by a Microsoft Research SenseCam that our subjects used. The hypothesis is that if the same two scale structure is observed here, the constraint is possibly not one that is imposed by the cognitive system. We use and contrast two methods by which images can be represented: the traditional color histogram and a more recently developed color correlogram method. The color correlogram is established to work better for our current purposes. We observe hints of a two scale structure in the correlation dimension plots but these are not conclusive.",>Vishnu Sreekumar>Yuwen Zhuang>Simon  Dennis>Mikhail Belkin,">Department of Psychology,  Ohio State University (OSU)>Department of Computer Science and Engineering,  Ohio State University (OSU)>Department of Psychology,  Ohio State University (OSU)>Department of Computer Science and Engineering,  Ohio State University (OSU)",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0261/index.html

Main effects of density and frequency were observed in mean latencies. Distributional analyses, in addition, revealed a density x frequency interaction: for low-frequency words, density effects were mediated predominantly by distributional shifting whereas for high-frequency words, density effects were absent except at the slower RTs, implicating distributional skewing. The present findings suggest that density effects in low-frequency words reflect processes involved in early lexical access, while the effects observed in high-frequency words reflect late postlexical checking processes.",>Stephen Wee Hun Lim>Melvin J.

In two artificial grammar learning experiments we explore the role of learning biases in shaping the distribution of phonological patterns across the worlds languages. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that learners are biased toward phonological patterns that occur in natural language, as opposed to patterns that are not found across the worlds languages. Specifically, learners are biased towards directional vowel harmony spreading processes. In Experiment 2, we exposed learners to a non-linguistic analogue to vowel harmony. Learners processed spreading such that learners favored the cross-linguistically valid pattern only when the first item of the series underwent spreading. This set of similarities and differences in learning may provide some insight into the origin of learning biases for spoken languages.",>Sara Finley>William Badecker,>University of Rochester>University of Arizona,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0263/index.html

Less is known, however, about the robustness of these constraints in the inference process and the way in which particular content influences the use of structural constraints in analogical inference. We conducted two studies testing whether the plausibility (or implausibility) of an inference influences adherence to general structural principles in analogical reasoning. We found substantial reliance on the predicted structural constraints, but also an influence of the plausibility of the inference.",>Linsey Smith>Dedre Gentner,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0264/index.html
2010,Cross-Modal Influence on Binocular Rivalry,"Binocular rivalry occurs when two distinct stimuli, one for each eye, are presented to corresponding retinal areas. Similar to other bistable phenomena such as Necker cubes, this overlap often causes one's conscious perception to alternate between a coherent perception of one stimulus, a coherent perception of the other and sometimes a mixture of the two. Previous studies have tried to identify where rivalry occurs, and what is actually being rivaled. Some studies have provided evidence for low-level effects on rivalry, lending support to the idea that rivalry is between monocular visual streams. Other studies have provided evidence for higher-level effects on rivalry, supporting the idea that rivalry is between opposing patterns. While this debate has largely been passed on in favor of a hybrid theory of rivalry that includes effects at several levels, questions still remain about specific higher-level effects. In the present study, we look at the effect of a congruent auditory stimulus on perception of rival videos of speaking people. We find that auditory stimuli can have an effect on rivalry, indicating that cross-modal processes such as speech to lip matching or voice to face matching are among the high-level factors impacting rivalry.",>Joshua Lewis>Adam Fouse>Virginia de Sa,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0265/index.html

I begin by looking at why the particular biological machinery that defines our nervous system matters. I then examine the particular machineries that constrain but also foster the development of human knowledge. Finally, I examine the kinds of activities that foster the development of knowledge, given the constraints of the given machinery, and conclude that activities that are repeated often and that involve meaningful interaction with an inherently meaningful environment form a plausible basis for the formation of knowledge within the particular neural net machinery that evolution has produced for us.",>Robin Flanagan,>Western Connecticut State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0266/index.html
2010,A Cross-linguistic Model of the Acquisition of Inflectional Morphology in English and Modern Greek,"We present a connectionist model of a general system for producing inflected words. The Multiple Inflection Genera-tor (MIG) combines elements of several previous models (e.g., association between phonological representations of stem and inflection form: Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986; multiple inflections for a grammatical class: Hoeffner & McClelland, 1993; lexical-semantic input: Joanisse & Sei-denberg, 1999; multiple grammatical classes: Plunkett & Juola, 1999). MIG assumes that the goal of the morpholog-ical component of the language system is to output a pho-nological form appropriate to the grammatical context in which the word appears. Our aim was to demonstrate that the model is able to capture developmental patterns in the acquisition of morphology in two different languages: one with a simple morphological system (English), and one characterized by rich morphology and absence of default forms (Modern Greek).",>Themis Karaminis>Michael Thomas,>Birkbeck College>Birkbeck College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0267/index.html
2010,Handling what the other sees: the effects of seeing and being seen on gesture production,"Language production is often argued to be adapted to addressees needs. As an instance of this, speakers produce fewer speech accompanying hand gestures if the speaker and the addressee cannot see each other. Yet there is also empirical evidence that speakers tend to base their language production on their own perspective, rather than their addressees. Therefore, speakers may gesture differently because they do not see their addressee, rather than because their addressee cannot see them. Can speakers truly apply their knowledge of what their addressee sees to their gesture production? We answered this question by carrying out a production experiment in which visibility between speaker and addressee was manipulated asymmetrically. We found that representational gestures were produced more frequently when speakers could be seen by their addressee, rather than when they could see their addressee, suggesting that speakers indeed apply their knowledge of the addressees perspective correctly to their gesturing.",>Lisette Mol>Emiel  Krahmer,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0268/index.html

However, researchers have been reluctant to extend its findings to explain the widespread occurrence of counterintuitive ideas in general. This article suggests a way to generalize the minimal counterintuitive hypothesis, which argues that such ideas spread because they are more memorable, to form the outline of a model of cultural dynamism which can help explain why strange and novel ideas spread more quickly than ordinary seeming traditional ideas.",>M.

We therefore propose that the degree of consciousness of a system can be measured in terms of the amount of data compression it carries out.",>Phil Maguire>Rebecca Maguire,>NUI Maynooth>Dublin Business School,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0270/index.html
2010,Feature repetition effects on object familiarity: Evidence from an old/new recognition task,"We performed an old/new study/test recognition task to investigate feature repetition effects on object familiarity. The results showed that repeated features increased old responses during the test phase for new objects. This increase was linear with the number of repeated features on the object. Old objects, which had been among the study phase stimuli, were not affected by the number of repeated features on the object. We also analyzed the effect of feature type (colour, shape, border and pattern) on familiarity responses. We found an effect of feature type only for the old objects. Saliency of the features also affected familiarity: the more salient the repeated feature was, the more familiar the object was found. We propose that the feature repetition effect for the new objects might be due to (1) activation of more than one representation constructed during the study phase (2) a separate representation for the repeated features, which has the potential to interfere with several perceptual processes.",>Selda Eren>Annette Hohenberger,>Middle East Technical University>Middle East Technical University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0271/index.html
2010,Beyond Transitional Probabilities: Human Learners Impose a Parsimony Bias in Statistical Word Segmentation,"Human infants and adults are able to segment coherent sequences from unsegmented strings of auditory stimuli after only a short exposure, an ability thought to be linked to early language acquisition. Although some research has hypothesized that learners succeed in these tasks by computing transitional probabilities between syllables, current experimental results do not differentiate between a range of models of different computations that learners could perform. We created a set of stimuli that was consistent with two different lexiconsone consisting of two-syllable words and one of three-syllable wordsbut where transition probabilities would not lead learners to segment sentences consistently according to either lexicon. Participants responses formed a distribution over possible segmentations that included consistent segmentations into both two- and three-syllable words, suggesting that learners do not use pure transitional probabilities to segment but instead impose a bias towards parsimony on the lexicons they learn.",>Michael Frank>Harry Tily>Inbal Arnon>Sharon Goldwater,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Stanford University>University of Manchester>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0272/index.html
2010,Effects of Goal Specificity on a Search in a Hypothesis Space and an Instance Space,"We examined the effect of goal specificity on a search in two problem spaces: a hypothesis space and an instance space. Two hypotheses were considered: 1) a nonspecific goal facilitates a search in a hypothesis space more than a specific goal, and 2) as a hypothesis space is searched more, the performance in discovering the target rule improves. We also defined an initial hypothesis space consisting of initially considered hypotheses, and investigated the effect of this initial hypothesis space on the goal specificity effect. The results of three experiments indicated that when an initial hypothesis space was offered, the goal specificity effect was observed. A nonspecific goal actually facilitated a search in the hypothesis space. When, however, no initial hypothesis space was offered, the goal specificity effect was not confirmed. We also found that the facilitation of the hypothesis space search improved performance in discovering the target rule.",>Miki Matsumuro>Kazuhisa Miwa,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0273/index.html

In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis, frame choice based on information about rarity. This hypothesis predicts that speakers tend to select a frame denoting a rare event. Four studies provide evidence that speakers choice of frame is consistent with the prediction from our hypothesis. Furthermore, our hypothesis is reconciled with the positive bias in frame choice, which cannot be accounted for by the reference point hypothesis. We discuss the possibility that linguistic behaviors are widely explained from peoples sensitivity to rarity information.",>Hidehito Honda>Toshihiko Matsuka,>Chiba University>Chiba University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0274/index.html
2010,Discovering Structure by Learning Sparse Graphs,"Systems of concepts such as colors, animals, cities, and artifacts are richly structured, and people discover the structure of these domains throughout a lifetime of experience. Discovering structure can be formalized as probabilistic inference about the organization of entities, and previous work has operationalized learning as selection amongst specific candidate hypotheses such as rings, trees, chains, grids, etc. defined by graph grammars [Kemp & Tenenbaum (2008). PNAS, 105(31), 10687-10692]. While this model makes discrete choices from a limited set, humans appear to entertain an unlimited range of hypotheses, many without an obvious grammatical description. In this paper, we approach structure discovery as optimization in a continuous space of all possible structures, while encouraging structures to be sparsely connected. When reasoning about animals and cities, the sparse model achieves performance equivalent to more structured approaches. We also explore a large domain of 1000 concepts with broad semantic coverage and no simple structure.",>Brenden Lake>Joshua Tenenbaum,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0275/index.html

This may be problematic when users have a deficient knowledge leading them to suboptimal information. In this study we examined how the externalized knowledge of social tags can be used to change navigation behavior and to trigger learning processes. In an online experiment with 531 participants we investigated the effect of the individual strength of association on navigation processes, and how the collective strength of association, visualized in tag clouds, may affect individual navigation and the strength of association. Results showed the effect of individual strength of association on navigation behavior, selection time and recognition.

Since spoken and signed languages do not share structure, the results suggest that linguistic information can be readily transmitted across modalities, and that parallel language activation can be driven by top-down processes.",>Anthony Shook>Viorica Marian,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0277/index.html
2010,Conditions of Directed Attention Inhibit Recognition Performance for Target-Aligned Stimuli,"Watanabe, Náñez & Sasak (2001) demonstrated that the perceptual learning of task-irrelevant items was enhanced under conditions when attentional resources were diverted away from the irrelevant stimuli. However, the current study suggests that when attention is depleted, recognition for task-irrelevant items is impaired in a subsequent recognition task. Participants were presented with a stream of simultaneously presented written words and line drawings, and required to respond to immediate repetitions in either the word or picture stream. A surprise recognition test measured performance for the words. When analyzing word recognition performance after attention had been directed to the pictures, words that had previously appeared when attention was most depleted (i.e., with a picture repetition in the primary task) were recognized at levels significantly below chance. This novel finding suggests that information that is actively ignored when appearing in conjunction with an attended stimulus is subsequently inhibited in a recognition task.",>Andrew Dewald>Scott Sinnett>Leonidas Domas,>University of Hawai'i at Manoa>University of Hawai'i at Manoa>University of Hawai'i at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0278/index.html

Our study investigated the effect of self-reported expertise, community rating, and age of weblog authors. In an online laboratory experiment, information seeking behavior of 60 participants on a science weblog was analyzed. As exemplary scenario, the discussion on the effects of violent media contents on children was chosen. Results showed that authors with a high level of expertise (operationalized by the author's self-reported profession) were rated as more credible and their texts were selected for further reading more frequently. This suggests that self-reported expertise emerges as a strong cue for information selection, whereas there was only partial evidence for the importance of community ratings.",>Stephan Winter>Nicole C.

2010,The Impact of Syntax on the Interpretation and Graphical Depiction of Underspecified Propositions,"Different representational systems permit differing degrees and forms of ambiguity and underspecification in the content they represent. Independently of this observation, a notable feature of natural language as a representational system is that it allows the same content to be expressed in different ways. In this paper, we examine the interaction of these two observations; in particular, we explore a number of linguistic forms involving underspecified content, and look at how subjects express the content of these linguistic forms both in logic and in diagrams. Our analysis demonstrates that variations in syntactic realization of the same semantic content lead to different interpretations of that content.",>Aaron Kalb>Dave Barker-Plummer>Richard Cox>Robert Dale>Deonne Castaneda>Christopher Potts,>Stanford University>Stanford University>University of Sussex>Macquarie University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0280/index.html
2010,Development of Prototype Abstraction and Exemplar Memorization,"We present a connectionist model of concept learning that integrates prototype and exemplar effects and reconciles apparently conflicting findings on the development of these effects. Using sibling-descendant cascade-correlation networks, we found that prototype effects were more prominent at the beginning of training and decreased with further training. In contrast, exemplar effects steadily increased with learning. Both kinds of effects were also influenced by category structure. Well-differentiated categories encouraged prototype abstraction while poorly structured categories promoted example memorization.",>Irina Beatu>Thomas Shultz,>McGill University>McGill University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0281/index.html
2010,"Person, place, and past influence eye movements during visual search","What is the role of an individuals past experience in guiding gaze in familiar environments? Contemporary models of search guidance suggest high level scene context is a strong predictor of where observers search in realistic scenes. Specific associations also develop between particular places and object locations. Together, scene context and place-specific associations bias attention to informative spatial locations. At the level of eye fixations, it is not known whether a persons specific search experience influences attentional selection. Eye movements are notoriously variable: people often foveate different places when searching for the same target in the same scene. Do individual differences in fixation locations influence how a scene is subsequently examined? We introduce a method, comparative map analysis, for analyzing spatial patterns in eye movement data. Using this method, we quantified the consistency of fixated locations within the same observer and between observers during search of real world scenes. Results indicated a remarkable consistency in the locations fixated by the same observer across multiple searches of a given scene. This observer-specific guidance was shown to be distinct from general scene context information or familiarity with the scene. Accordingly, this is considered evidence for a uniquely informative role of an individuals search experience on attentional guidance in a familiar scene.",>Barbara Hidalgo-Sotelo>Aude Oliva,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0282/index.html

In doing so, it investigates the acts of intending and contending in invoking and instantiating the categories. The paper explains perspective setting and taking in terms of intending and contending which are crucial in shaping the conceptual route for the gradual revelation of the communicative intent.

2010,Egocentric and allocentric spatial references in children with Cerebral Palsy,"Spatial memory is supported by multiple parallel representations of the environment. Egocentric perspective (body-centered) and allocentric representations (object-centered) are integrated to allow correct interaction with the world. According to Milner and Goodale (1995, 2008), the action-related dorsal system is specialized for location of objects in space and visuo-motor integration, and uses an egocentric frame of reference. The perception-related ventral system is specialized for categorical recognition of objects and forms, and supports an allocentric frame of reference. Here we use a Distance Judgment Task to explore the use of different spatial frames in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). Following the dorsal stream vulnerability hypothesis (Atkinson et al., 2007) children with CP might have more difficulties in egocentric judgments and in the processing of peri-personal space than controls. No significant difference emerged between CP children and controls in allocentric judgments, whereas performance was worse in egocentric judgment, indicating inefficient use of the body-centered representations.

2010,Vocabulary Spurt; Are Infants full of Zipf?,"Infants do not learn words at a constant rate. During the second year of life, a dramatic increase in the speed of word learning is observed. Different mechanisms explaining this vocabulary spurt have been proposed, either through endogenous factors such as learning capacity or exogenous factors, such as frequency of word usage. We demonstrate that occurrence statistics alone is not sufficient to explain the acceleration in vocabulary growth, discuss other potential exogenous contributions such as phonological complexity and suggest that a change in word learning capacities is necessary. A model implementing an increased ease of learning is introduced and illustrates this endogenous approach by replicating the non-linear vocabulary growth characteristics of language acquisition.",>Julien Mayor>Kim Plunkett,">Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language>University of Oxford",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0285/index.html

Developmental evidence demonstrating that children the age of five are more sensitive to item information suggests that children might be described by item-noise models. We tested children and adults performance and eye movements during recognition and found that adults usage of category context was evident in both their performance and in their eye movements. Children, however, did not give conclusive evidence in their memory performance but their eye movements did not reflect usage of category context.",>Adam Osth>Simon Dennis>Vladimir Sloutsky,>The Ohio-State University>The Ohio-State University>The Ohio-State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0286/index.html
2010,Visual Similarity is ObViS,"Visual search for a target is affected by visual similarity. Research on visual similarity has primarily focused on the high-level features of objects. Real-world objects are composed of low-level features that can be harder to measure and categorize. We have developed ObViS, an algorithm that measures the visual similarity of objects, based on Rao & Ballard (1995). ObViS calculates a high-dimensional vector that represents the low-level features of a real-world object. The algorithm was applied to a library of real-world object images in order to calculate the similarity of each object to every other object in the library. Two experiments evaluated the ability of our algorithm to predict the effects of visual similarity on visual search behavior.",>Michel Brudzinski>Chris Sims>Wayne Gray>Michael Schoelles,>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0287/index.html

2010,Encoding Sequential Information in Vector Space Models of Semantics: Comparing Holographic Reduced Representation and Random Permutation,"Encoding information about the order in which words typically appear has been shown to improve the performance of high-dimensional semantic space models. This requires an encoding operation capable of binding together vectors in an order-sensitive way, and efficient enough to scale to large text corpora. Although both circular convolution and random permutations have been enlisted for this purpose in semantic models, these operations have never been systematically compared. In Experiment 1 we compare their storage capacity and probability of correct retrieval; in Experiments 2 and 3 we compare their performance on semantic tasks when integrated into existing models. We conclude that random permutations are a scalable alternative to circular convolution with several desirable properties.",>Gabriel Recchia>Michael Jones>Magnus Sahlgren>Pentti Kanerva,">Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington>Swedish Institute of Computer Science>Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, UC Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0290/index.html

Are such relations necessarily part of an innate representational endowment provided to humans? Or, is it possible for a learning system to acquire abstract relations from non-relational inputs of realistic complexity (avoiding hand-coding)?

2010,You Cant Wear a Coat Rack: A Binding Framework to Avoid Illusory Feature Migrations in Perceptually Grounded Semantic Models,"Recent Semantic Space Models (SSMs) are now integrating perceptual information with linguistic statistics into a unified mental space, offering a solution to the criticism that SSMs are disembodied. However, these new models introduce the problem of illusory feature migrations. When the word dog is perceived, its perceptual features should migrate to hyena, so the system can infer the perceptual features for a non-perceived word (hyenas have fur). In doing so, however, the models are unable to avoid migrating the features for dog to syntagmatically related words, such as bone. As a result, the models incorrectly infer that bones have fur. We argue that the problems of perceptual grounding and word order are not independenta model of word order information is needed to correctly infer how features should migrate in mental space. We introduce a multiplicative binding framework that allows all information sources to be stored in a composite mental space, but features will only migrate to words that share sufficient order information with directly perceived words.",>Michael Jones>Gabriel Recchia,">Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0292/index.html
2010,The evocative power of words: Activation of visual information by verbal and nonverbal means,"A major part of learning a language is learning to map spoken words onto objects in the environment. An open question concerns the consequence this learning has for cognition and perception. We show that hearing common words (e.g., dog) activates visual information more than equally informative non-linguistic information (e.g., a dog bark). The main results show that (1) pictures were verified more quickly after hear-ing a word than after hearing a nonverbal sound, even after hundreds of trials of practice. (2) Verbal labels activated vis-ual information more effectively than nonverbal sounds as tested by a simple visual discrimination task that required mi-nimal semantic processing. (3) The advantage of the verbal modality did not arise simply due to greater familiarity of verbal labels: when experience with novel labels and sounds was equated, verbal labels continued to activate the associated visual information more reliably than the equally well-learned nonverbal sounds. These results inform the understanding of how human cognition is shaped by language and hint at ef-fects that different patterns of naming can have on individu-als conceptual structure.",>Gary Lupyan>Sharon Thompson-Schill,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0293/index.html
2010,Perceptual Simulations of Temporal Uses of In and On in First and Second Language Processing,"Prepositions in natural languages often appear to be governed by arbitrary conventionalized idiomatic uses (e.g., I was born in May, I will see you on Sunday). We present empirical evidence that such prepositional uses are not entirely arbitrary, as they activate image-schematic perceptual simulations during language processing. In Experiment 1, native speakers of English were prompted to think about either the date or the month of their birthday, and then select one of four calendar diagrams, two foils, one flat calendar and one box-like calendar diagram designed to invoke perceptual simulations of support and containment respectively. There was a significant relationship between the question prompt (implicitly eliciting in or on) and the type of calendar chosen (containment or support). Thus, spatial schemas can be spontaneously activated when thinking about time even for non-literal, idiomatic uses. Prepositional uses are notoriously difficult for English L2 learners. We surmised that improper prepositional uses may be linked to improper underlying perceptual simulations. This was confirmed in Experiment 2 where Japanese-speaking students of English were presented the same task as Experiment 1. Here, results indicate no relation between the date or month question and calendar choice. The experiments offer both theoretical and practical insights into how prepositions are processed by individuals with varying levels of language knowledge.",>Luca Onnis>Daniel Jackson>Michael Spivey,>University of Hawaii Manoa>University of Hawaii Manoa>Unversity of California Merced,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0294/index.html
2010,A Motion Aftereffect from Literal and Metaphorical Motion Language: Individual Differences,"Do people spontaneously form visual mental images when understanding language, and if so how truly visual are these representations? We test whether processing linguistic descriptions of motion produces sufficiently vivid mental images to cause direction-selective motion adaptation in the visual system (i.e., cause a motion aftereffect illusion). We tested for motion aftereffects (MAEs) following explicit motion imagery, and after processing literal or metaphorical motion language. Intentionally imagining motion produces an aftereffect in the overall sample with some participants showing a greater aftereffect than others. We then find that participants who show the strongest imagined motion aftereffects also show aftereffects in the natural course of processing motion language (without instructions to imagine). Individuals who do not show strong motion aftereffects as a result of imagining motion also do not show them from processing motion language. However, the aftereffect from language gained strength as people were exposed to more and more of a motion story. For the last two story installments (out of 4), understanding motion language produced reliable MAEs across the entire sample. The results demonstrate that processing language can spontaneously create sufficiently vivid mental images to produce direction-selective adaptation in the visual system. The timecourse of adaptation suggests that individuals may differ in how efficiently they recruit visual mechanisms in the service of language understanding. Further, the results reveal an intriguing link between the vividness of mental imagery and the nature of the processes and representations involved in language understanding.",>Alexia Toskos Dils>Lera Boroditsky,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0295/index.html
2010,Language-Driven Motor Simulation is Sensitive to Social Context,"People use their bodies differently in different social situations. In Korea, Japan, and Thailand, for example, there are culture-specific conventions for how to transfer small objects. People use one hand to transfer objects to people of equal or lower social status, but two hands with people of higher status. But does individual knowledge of these conventions for how to use ones body extend to other aspects of cognition? For instance, it is known that understanding action language involves internally simulating what it would be like to perform described actions. Do people mentally simulate actions appropriate to the social context described in a sentence? We report on a behavioral experiment, conducted with people born and raised in Korea, that investigated whether cultural practices affect the actions that people represent during language comprehension. We report evidence that motor simulations do indeed reflect social constraints on action.",>Heeyeon Y. Dennison>Benjamin K.

2010,Connecting Causal Events: Learning Causal Structures Through Repeated Interventions Over Time,"How do we learn causal structures? All current approaches use scenarios in which trials are temporally independent; however, people often learn about scenarios unfolding over time. In such cases, people may assume that other variables dont change at the same instant as an intervention. In Experiment 1, participants were much more successful at learning causal structures when this assumption was upheld than violated. In Experiment 2, participants were less influenced by such temporal information when they believed the trials to be temporally independent, but still used the temporal strategy to some extent. People seem to be inclined to learn causal structures by connecting events over time.",>Benjamin Rottman>Frank Keil,>Yale University>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0297/index.html
2010,The induction of hidden causes: Causal mediation and violations of independent causal influence,"In order to explain the apparent violation of a causal assumption, people often posit hidden causes. The assumption of independent causal influence states that the power of a cause to produce or prevent an effect is independent of other causes. Some preventers violate independent causal influence; we conducted an experiment to test whether people posit a hidden mediating cause to explain these preventers. The results indicated that participants are more likely to posit a hidden mediator when the preventer violates independent causal influence.",>Christopher Carroll>Patricia Cheng,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0298/index.html

This presents a problem for existing models of causal reasoning, as most predict independence. To deal with this problem, we propose an edge replacement process that builds up apparently probabilistic causal relations using hidden deterministic causes. This model allows us to fit nonindependence effects, and shows promise for modeling other phenomena, such as how causal relations change over time.",>David Buchanan>Joshua Tenenbaum>David Sobel,>Brown University>MIT>Brown University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0299/index.html
2010,Agents and Causes: A Bayesian Error Attribution Model of Causal Reasoning,"One of the most fundamental assumptions underlying causal Bayes nets is the Markov constraint. According to this constraint, an inference between a cause and an effect should be invariant across conditions in which other effects of this cause are present or absent. Previous research has demonstrated that reasoners tend to violate this assumption systematically over a wide range of domains. We hypothesize that people are guided by abstract assumptions about the mechanisms underlying otherwise identical causal relations. In particular, we suspect that the distinction between agents and patients, which can be disentangled from the distinction between causes and effects, influences which causal variable people blame when an error occurs. We have developed a causal Bayes net model which captures different error attributions using a hidden common preventive noise source that provides a rational explanation of these apparent violations.

We present DUCCA assumptions and operation and use the architecture to simulate a few effects observed in Stroop-like task, a hallmark test of how control deals with interference.

2010,Modelling the Correlation Between Two Putative Inhibition Tasks: An Analytic Approach,"A process of response inhibition is often held to be recruited in situations where it is necessary to withhold or inhibit a prepotent response. Individual differences in the efficacy of this function have been held to underlie individual differences in behaviour on tasks such as the Stroop colour-naming task and the stop-signal task. These claims, however, have been supported only with correlational analyses and informal argument. This paper considers the operationalisation of response inhibition by exploring existing mathematical and process models of both the Stroop and stop-signal tasks. We identify parameters that might underlie individual differences in the performance of the tasks and consider potential relations between those parameters. It is shown that (a) at least three potential inter-relations between parameters of the task models may lead to inter-task correlations, and (b) the observed correlations arise when attentional bias parameters in the models are equated but not when inhibition parameters are equated. We conclude that the ascription of such correlations to a process of response inhibition is premature.",>Eddy Davelaar>Richard Cooper,">Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0302/index.html
2010,Estimation of Trade-off between Costs of Preprocessing and Primary Processing,"People often conduct preprocessing to simplify primary processing. Usually, there is a trade-off between the costs of performing preprocessing and primary processing. Therefore, the utility of preprocessing differs depending on the task complexity. We conducted three experiments to find out whether people could adaptively estimate the utility of preprocessing and then take rational action. The overall result was that in performing a high complexity task, almost all the participants made a rational choice. However, for a low complexity task, the participants gradually learned to conduct preprocessing despite it not being effective. These results were explained based on theoretical perspectives proposed in previous studies.",>Akihiro Maehigashi>Kazuhisa Miwa,>Nagoya University>Nagoya University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0303/index.html
2010,Increasing Information Access Cost to Protect Against Interruption Effects during Problem Solving,"The aim of this experiment was to examine whether increasing the cost of accessing the goal-state during problem solving would induce a more internalized strategy that would protect against the negative effect of interruption. The soft constraints hypothesis (Gray, Sims, Fu & Schoelles, 2006) predicts that a more memory-based strategy will be developed with increasing information access cost (IAC). Three levels of access cost were used in the Tower of Hanoi (ToH) with three types of interrupting task (simple ToH, mental arithmetic and a blank screen control). Increasing access cost to a mouse movement and a few seconds delay to view the goal-state encouraged a strategy that not only improved resumption from memory but also reduced the number of moves required to solve the primary task. These effects came at no extra time cost and occurred irrespective of the type of interrupting task. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed together with issues of using access cost as a method for alleviating the negative effects of interruption.",>Phillip Morgan>John Patrick>Tanya Patrick,>Cardiff University>Cardiff University>Cardiff University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0304/index.html
2010,An Agent-based Simulation of the Effectiveness of Creative Leadership,"This paper investigates the effectiveness of creative versus uncreative leadership using EVOC, an agent-based model of cultural evolution. Each iteration, each agent in the artificial society invents a new action, or imitates a neighbors action. Only the leaders actions can be imitated by all other agents, referred to as followers. Two measures of creativity were used: (1) invention-to-imitation ratio, i_Leader, which measures how often an agent invents, and (2) rate of conceptual change, c_Leader, which measures how creative an invention is. High i_Leader increased mean fitness of ideas, but only when creativity of followers was low. High i_Leader was associated with greater diversity of ideas in the early stage of idea generation only. High c_Leader increased mean fitness of ideas in the early stage of idea generation; in the later stage it decreased idea fitness. Reasons for these findings and tentative implications for creative leadership in human society are discussed.",>Stefan Leijnen>Liane Gabora,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0305/index.html

2010,The Cognitive Cost of Ethnocentrism,"Recent computational studies suggest that ethnocentrism, commonly thought to rely on complex social cognition, may arise through biological evolution in populations with minimal cognitive abilities. We use the methods of evolutionary game theory and computational modelling to examine the evolution of ethnocentrism. Since ethnocentric agents differentiate between in- and out-group partners, and adjust their behavior accordingly, they are more cognitively complex than humanitarian or selfish agents that always cooperate or defect, respectively. We associate a fitness cost with this complexity and test the robustness of ethnocentrism, concluding that ethnocentrism is not robust against increases in cost of cognition. Our model confirms that humanitarians are suppressed largely by ethnocentrics. Paradoxically, we observe that the proportion of cooperation is higher in worlds dominated by ethnocentrics. We conclude that suppressing free-riders, such as selfish and traitorous agents, allows ethnocentrics to maintain higher levels of cooperative interactions.",>Artem Kaznatcheev,>McGill University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0307/index.html

It remains a debate as to whether this correlation is based purely on similarity preference - the matching hypothesis - or marketplace forces. We present a new marketplace model for romantic relationships. Previous models granted every person access to his/her own attractiveness. In reality, people have only a vague idea of their own attractiveness ratings. We introduce a concept analogous to self-esteem to model this phenomenon. Further, we extend beyond previous models by dealing explicitly with both the initialization and development of a relationship. Our model accounts for the experimental tendency to choose more attractive partners, while still explaining observed intra-couple attractiveness correlation and the difference in correlation between casual and serious daters.",>Artem Kaznatcheev>Kyler Brown>Thomas Shultz,>McGill University>McGill University>McGill University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0308/index.html
2010,Determining the Internal Consistency of Attitude Attributions,"In the attitude attribution paradigm, observers must estimate the true attitude of an author who was assigned to advocate a particular position. Observers tendency to attribute an attitude in line with the expressed position despite its having been assigned is called the correspondence bias. While there is strong evidence that such attributions are externally invalid, it is less clear whether they are internally consistent. This research develops a Bayesian model that specifies what attitude an observer should attribute, given assumptions about the prior attitude distribution, and perceptions of the degree of compliance shown in the essay and the strength of the situation. The model reproduces classical findings regarding chosen vs. assigned positions, prior attitude probability, and degree of compliance, and also fits newly collected data. The results suggest that future research should examine observers assumptions and perceptions, and focus less on the reasoning process itself.",>Kyle Jennings,">University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0309/index.html

Cohesion generally has a facilitative effect on text comprehension and is assumed to be related to essay coherence. By contrast, recent studies of essay writing have demonstrated that computational indices of cohesion are not predictive of evaluations of writing quality. This study investigates expert ratings of individual text features, including coherence, in order to examine their relation to evaluations of holistic essay quality. The results suggest that coherence is an important attribute of overall essay quality, but that expert raters evaluate coherence based on the absence of cohesive cues in the essays rather than their presence.

2010,An acquired taste: How reading literature affects sensitivity to word distributions when judging literary texts,"This study examines how reading habits affect peoples sensitivity to word distributions in literary and non-literary writing. We manipulated eight literary and non-literary passages, creating modified versions that had lower word chunk frequencies but higher individual word frequencies than the originals. Subjects were then asked to rate the passages quality of writing. Results showed that subjects with more experience reading literary writing (literary readers) gave higher ratings to original literary passages, while subjects with less literary reading experience (non-literary readers) preferred modified versions. Subjects with both types of reading habits rated original versions of non-literary passages higher. This indicates that literary readers are sensitive to frequencies of word chunks containing words that appear more frequently in the literary genre, while non-literary readers are not. We suggest that, over time, people can acquire slightly different representations of the probabilistic structure of language through their specific linguistic exposure.",>Justine Kao>Robert Ryan>Melody Dye>Michael Ramscar,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0311/index.html

The work recounted here examines how, and how well, people use context to in-terpret noisy transcribed utterances in a challenging domain. Models learned from this experiment highlight two aspects of this human skill: the ability to detect a context-supported match, and the ability to know when the quality of attempted matches is so poor that it should be questioned.

2010,Spatial Reasoning as Verbal Reasoning,"We introduce an approach for how spatial reasoning can be conceived as verbal reasoning. We describe a theory of how humans construct a mental representation given onedimensional spatial relations. In this construction process objects are inserted in a dynamic structure called a queue which provides an implicit direction. The spatial interpretation of this direction can be chosen freely. This implies that choices in the process of constructing a mental representation influence the result of deductive spatial reasoning. To derive the precise rules for the construction process we employ the assumption that humans try to minimize their cognitive effort, and a cost measure is introduced to judge the efficiency of the construction process. From this we deduce how the queue should be constructed. We discuss empirical evidence for this approach as well as a computational implementation of the construction process.",>Antje Krumnack>Leandra  Bucher >Jelica Nejasmic>Markus Knauff,">Department of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen>Department of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen>Department of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen>Department of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0313/index.html
2010,Arbitrating Between Theory-Theory and Simulation Theory: Evidence from a Think-Aloud Study of Counterfactual Reasoning,"How we engage in mental state reasoning remains a contentious issue, reflected in the debate between theory-theorists, who argue that we deploy theory-based rules, and simulation theorists, who argue that such reasoning is subserved by simulation processes. The present study examined whether theory-based or simulation-based reasoning is adopted in regret-oriented counterfactual scenarios involving mental state inferences. Participants thought aloud while reasoning through such scenarios from the perspective of themselves, themselves and another, or two other individuals. The scenarios also manipulated the controllability of event outcomes. Results revealed more theorizing in the uncontrollable than the controllable scenarios, and more simulation in the controllable than uncontrollable ones. More theorizing was also observed in the other-and-other than the self-only condition. These findings highlight the value of adopting a hybrid model of mental state reasoning, where theorizing and simulation are integrated within a common framework, with such processing being deployed in a context-sensitive manner.",>Meredith Wilkinson>Linden Ball>Rachel  Cooper,>Lancaster University>Lancaster University>Lancaster University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0314/index.html
2010,Less-is-more effects in knowledge-based heuristic inference,"Inference on the basis of recognition alone is assumed to occur prior to accessing further information (Pachur & Hertwig, 2006). A counterintuitive result of this is the less-is-more effect: a drop in the accuracy with which choices are made as to which of two or more items scores highest on a given criterion as more items are learned (Frosch, Beaman & McCloy, 2007; Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002). In this paper, we show that less-is-more effects are not unique to recognition-based inference but can also be observed with a knowledge-based strategy provided two assumptions, limited information and differential access, are met. The LINDA model which embodies these assumptions is presented. Analysis of the less-is-more effects predicted by LINDA and by recognition-driven inference shows that these occur for similar reasons and casts doubt upon the special nature of recognition-based inference. Suggestions are made for empirical tests to compare knowledge-based and recognition-based less-is-more effects",>Philip Beaman>Philip Smith>Rachel McCloy,">University of Reading>University of Reading>University of Reading, HM Treasury",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0315/index.html
2010,What Makes a Good Reasoner?: Brain Potentials and Heuristic Bias Susceptibility,Human reasoning is often biased by intuitive heuristics. A key question is why some people are less susceptible to this bias than others. It is debated whether the bias results from a failure to monitor ones intuitive conclusions for conflict with logical considerations or from a failure to inhibit the tempting intuitions. This results in different views on the role of individual differences in executive monitoring and inhibition capacity for sound reasoning. The present study presents a new approach to address this issue. After an initial reasoning screening a group of the most and least biased reasoners were invited for an EEG study in which neural markers of their executive monitoring (ERN amplitude) and inhibition (N2 amplitude) skills were recorded. Results indicated that biased reasoners were characterized by less developed inhibition but not monitoring capacity. Findings support the view that monitoring ones intuition for conflict during thinking is a flawless and undemanding process suggesting that even the poorest reasoners at least detect that they are biased.,>Wim De Neys>Nikolay  Novitskiy >Jennifer  Ramautar>Johan Wagemans,>CNRS - Université de Toulouse>University of Leuven>Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience>University of Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0316/index.html

A critical next step in the development of embodied theories is to flesh out ideas in terms of implemented computational models. This symposium features speakers who currently are working toward that goal, including Giovanni Pezzulo, Angelo Cangelosi, and Michael Spivey, as well as discussion by Lawrence Barsalou, Martin Fischer, and Ken McRae. These researchers describe and discuss challenges for embodied models.

2010,On the Notion of Intended Meaning,"The issue of intended meaning is an open problem in the study of linguistic processes. The paper presents a notion of intended meaning based on the idea of speakers preference for a state of affairs to which a sentence refers. Its argument has two components. The first is the conception of meaning developed by analytic philosophy of language; that is, the meaning of a sentence depends on the truth conditions of the sentence, and the meaning of an expression depends on contribution of that expression to the truth value of the sentence in which it appears. The second is the notion of agents interest, as a state of affairs which implies a goal of agent, as developed by cognitive social theory. The paper maintains that a speakers intended meaning establishes when the truth conditions of a sentence and the possibility conditions of the state of affairs preferred by the agent match. The last part of the paper illustrates three linguistic disputes to support its theoretical intuitions. The first dispute concerns syntactic ambiguity, while the other two disputes concern semantic ambiguity. The paper deals with the general problem of the semantic underdeterminacy of the conventional meaning of natural language sentences. Its specific contribution relates to the problem of intended meaning in communicative processes and to meaning negotiation processes in conflicting interactions.",>Marco Cruciani,>University of Trento,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0318/index.html
2010,Predicative Metaphor Comprehension as Indirect Categorization,"In this paper, we address the problem of how people understand predicative metaphors such as ``The rumor flew through the office,'' and argue that predicative metaphors are understood as indirect categorizations. In the indirect categorization process, the verb (e.g., fly) of a predicative metaphor evokes an intermediate entity, which in turn evokes a metaphoric category of actions or states (e.g., ``to spread rapidly and soon disappear'') to be attributed to the target noun (e.g., rumor), rather than directly creating a metaphoric category as argued by Glucksberg's (2001) categorization theory. We test our argument using two experiments, offline comprehension and online priming. The two experiments provided convergent evidence for our argument. The psychological validity of indirect categorization as a process of predicative metaphor comprehension was confirmed.",>Akira Utsumi>Maki Sakamoto,>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0319/index.html

Parents differentiated joking from pretense book pages by using (1) more disbelief statements and humor-specific words, (2) fewer belief statements, and pretense-specific words. Parents differentiated joking from literal book pages by using more (1) high-level abstract language, (2) disbelief statements, and (3) humor-specific words. This study extends findings that abstract language cues non-literal concepts in general (e.g., metaphor, irony).

2010,Wrongness and Representational Thought,"This paper examines the concept of wrongness as a violation of intention, convention, or fact. We demonstrate that wrongness is an underlying factor in mistakes, jokes, pretense, lying, metaphor, and irony. We argue that childrens use and understanding of wrongness evolves in four steps through a developing understanding of representation. First, children understand that a wrong act can refer to a right act, through mistakes and basic jokes. Second, this leads to understanding that a wrong act can represent a right act, through pretense, puns and metaphor. Third, this leads to understanding mental representation, which in combination with understanding reference allows understanding of intentional jokes and lies. Finally, this leads to understanding mental representation in combination with representation, allowing an understanding of irony, and intentional pretense, metaphor, and puns.",>Elena Hoicka>Merideth Gattis,>University of Stirling>Cardiff University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0321/index.html
2010,Spatial Position in Language and Visual Memory: A Cross-Linguistic Comparison,"German and English speakers employ different strategies to encode static spatial scenes involving the axial position (standing vs. lying) of an inanimate figure object with respect to a ground object. In a series of three experiments, we show that this linguistic difference is not reflected in native speakers ability to detect changes in axial position in nonlinguistic memory tasks. Furthermore, even when participants are required to use language to encode a spatial scene, they do not rely on language during a recognition memory task. These results have implications for the relationship between language and visual memory.",>Solveig Bosse>Anna Papafragou,>Univ of Delaware>Univ of Delaware,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0322/index.html
2010,Generalized Event Knowledge Activation During Online Language Comprehension,"Online language comprehension is guided by knowledge regarding real-world events. However, it remains unclear whether activation of event knowledge during language comprehension is constrained by the linguistic context or is generalized, including a wide variety of information associated with the event even if that information has not been mentioned previously and does not satisfy constraints imposed by the local linguistic context. The present study addresses this issue by analyzing event-related brain potentials recorded as participants read brief scenarios describing typical real-world events. The amplitude of the N400 elicited by a contextually anomalous word was reduced if that word was related to the event described. This result suggests that online language comprehension involves construction of rich event representations that include information beyond that which is relevant to the processing of the current linguistic input.",>Ross Metusalem>Marta Kutas>Mary Hare>Ken McRae>Jeffrey L.

2010,Framed: Factors influencing reference frame choice in tabletop space,"While English speakers generally rely on a viewer-centered frame of reference when interpreting table-top space, they will also adopt an object-centered frame in certain situationsprompting the question: What factors determine which frame? The current research investigates two possible contributors: the intrinsic frontedness of a reference object involved in the scene and the syntactic structure of the sentence used to describe the scene. If an object possesses an intrinsic front side, then this side should highlight the properties necessary for the object to be capable of having its own distinguishable perspective. Also, certain linguistic constructions may further increase the salience of the reference objects inherent geometrical properties, leading to greater use of an object-centered frame.",>Laurie Robinette>Michele Feist>Michael Kalish,>University of Louisiana at Lafayette>University of Louisiana at Lafayette>University of Louisiana at Lafayette,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0324/index.html
2010,Sentence Production in Naturalistic Scenes with Referential Ambiguity,"Language production often happens in a visual context, for example when a speaker describes a picture. This raises the question whether visual factors interact with conceptual factors during linguistic encoding. To address this question, we present an eye-tracking experiment that manipulates visual clutter (density of objects in the scene) and animacy in a sentence production task using naturalistic, referentially ambiguous scenes. We found that clutter leads to more fixations on target objects before they are mentioned, contrary to results for visual search, and that this effect is modulated by animacy. We also tested the eye-voice span hypothesis (objects are fixated before they are mentioned), and found that a significantly more complex pattern obtains in naturalistic, referentially ambiguous scenes.",>Moreno I.

2010,Uncertainty in causal inference: The case of retrospective revaluation,"Since causal evidence is often ambiguous, models of causal learning should be able to represent uncertainty over causal hypotheses. Uncertainty is especially important in retrospective revaluation (the re-evaluation of ambiguous evidence in light of subsequent learning). We examine how a Bayesian model and an associative model (the modified SOP model of Dickinson & Burke, 1996) deal with this uncertainty. We tested the predictions of the models in an experiment with retrospective revaluation of preventive causes. Results were consistent with the predictions of the Bayesian model, but inconsistent with the predictions of the modified SOP model.",>Christopher Carroll>Patricia Cheng>Hongjing Lu,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0326/index.html
2010,The Role of Causal Schemas in Inductive Reasoning,"Inductive reasoning allows us to go beyond the target hypothesis and capitalize on prior knowledge. Past research has shown that both the similarity of categories and specific knowledge about causal relations affect inductive plausibility. We go one step further and focus on the role of abstract causal schemas about main effects and interactions. Two experiments show that both prior assumptions about abstract causal schemas and the similarity of the corresponding causal effects affect inductive judgments. Reasoners have different prior beliefs about the likelihood of main-effect versus interactive schemas, and rationally combine these prior beliefs with new evidence in a way that can be modeled as Bayesian belief updating.",>Ralf Mayrhofer>Jonas Nagel>Michael Waldmann,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0327/index.html
2010,Causal Conditional Reasoning and Conditional Likelihood,"We hypothesized that causal conditional reasoning reflects judgment of the conditional likelihood of causes and effects based on a probabilistic causal model of the scenario being judged. Although this proposal has much in common with Cummins (1995) theory based on the number of disabling conditions and alternative causes, it takes more variables into account and therefore makes some differing predictions. To test this idea we collected judgments of the causal parameters of the conditionals and used them to derive predictions from a model with zero free parameters. We compared these predictions to Cummins acceptability ratings and to analogous likelihood judgments that we also collected. The hypothesis was borne out for Affirming the Consequent and the analogous diagnostic likelihood judgments, where the model obtained close fits to both data sets. However, we found a surprising dissociation between Modus Ponens and judgments of predictive likelihood leading to a relatively poor fit to the Modus Ponens acceptability ratings. We propose an explanation for this in the discussion.",>Philip Fernbach>Adam Darlow,>Brown University>Brown University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0328/index.html
2010,Causal Models Interact with Structure Mapping to Guide Analogical Inference,"We recently proposed a theoretical integration of analogical transfer with causal learning and inference (Lee & Holyoak, 2008). A Bayesian theory of learning and inference based on causal models (Lee, Holyoak & Lu, 2009) accounts for the fact that judgments of confidence in analogical inferences are partially dissociable from measures of the quality of the mapping between source and target analogs. The integrated theory postulates a dual role for causal relations, which can guide both analogical mapping and also subsequent inferences about the target. It follows that depending on whether or not a mapping is structurally ambiguous, dropping a preventive cause from the target can either decrease or increase confidence in the same analogical inference. We report an experiment that yielded data in close agreement with predictions of the Bayesian theory. These results provide further support for the importance of integrating analogical transfer with the broader framework of causal models.",>Hee Seung Lee>Keith Holyoak,">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0329/index.html
2010,Symbolic Reasoning in Spiking Neurons: A Model of the Cortex/Basal Ganglia/Thalamus Loop,"We present a model of symbol manipulation implemented using spiking neurons and closely tied to the anatomy of the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. The model is a general-purpose neural controller which plays a role analogous to a production system. Information stored in cortex is used by the basal ganglia as the basis for selecting between a set of inferences. When an inference rule is selected, it commands the thalamus to modify and transmit information between areas of the cortex. The system supports special-case and general-purpose inferences, including the ability to remember complex statements and answer questions about them. The resulting model suggests modifications to the standard structure of production system rules, and offers a neurological explanation for the 50 millisecond cognitive cycle time.",>Terrence Stewart>Xuan Choo>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0330/index.html
2010,A Hubel Weisel model for hierarchical representation of concepts in textual documents,"Hubel Weisel models of the cortex describe visual processing as a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated representations. While several models exist for image processing, little work has been done with Hubel Weisel models out of the domain of object recognition. In this paper, we describe how such models can be extended to the representation of concepts, resulting in a model that shares several properties with the PDP model of semantic cognition. The model that we propose is also capable of incremental learning, in which the knowledge is stored in the strength of the neuron connections. Degradation of old knowledge occurs as new knowledge is introduced to the system in a fashion that simulates decay theory in short term memory. The simulation model therefore captures several properties of cognitive conceptual memory, including generalization patterns, the role of rehearsal and, hierarchical representation.",>Kiruthika Ramanathan>Luping Shi>Tow Chong  Chong,">Data Storage Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research>Data Storage Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research>Data Storage Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0331/index.html
2010,Automatic and Controlled Processes in Semantic Priming: an Attractor Neural Network Model with Latching Dynamics,"Semantic priming involves a combination of automatic processes like spreading activation (SA) and controlled processes like expectancy and semantic matching. An alternative account for automatic priming has been suggested using attractor neural networks. Such networks offer a more biologically plausible model of real neuronal dynamics but fall short in explaining several important effects such as mediated and asymmetrical priming, as well as controlled effects. We describe a new attractor network which incorporates synaptic adaptation mechanisms and performs latching dynamics. We show that this model can implement spreading activation in a statistical manner and therefore exhibit all priming effects previously attributed to automatic priming. In addition, we show how controlled processes are implemented in the same network, explaining many other semantic priming results.",>Itamar Lerner>Shlomo Bentin>Oren Shriki,">Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation, The Hebrew University in Jerusalem (HUJI)>Department of Psychology and Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation, The Hebrew University in Jerusalem (HUJI)>Department of Physiology and Neurobiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0332/index.html
2010,Cognitive Models and the Wisdom of Crowds: A Case Study Using the Bandit Problem,"The wisdom of the crowds refers to the idea that the aggregated performance of a group of people on a challenging task may be superior to the performance of any of the individuals. For some tasks, like estimating a single quantity, it is straightforward to aggregate individual behavior. For more complicated multidimensional or sequential tasks, however, it is not so straightforward. Cognitive models of behavior are needed, to infer what people know from how they behave, and allow aggregation to be done on the inferred knowledge. We provide a case study of this role for cognitive modeling in the wisdom of crowds, using a multidimensional sequential optimization problem, known as the bandit problem, for which there are large differences in individual ability. We show that, using some established cognitive models of peoples decision-making on these problems, aggregate performance approaches optimality, and exceeds the performance of the vast majority of individuals.",>Shunan Zhang>Michael Lee,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0333/index.html

We manipulate whether estimation is done alone or with others, whether it is done independently or with the knowledge of the estimates of others, and whether it is done in a cooperative or competitive environment. From these basic estimation data, we construct a series of aggregated group estimates, exploring the conditions under which a small group of three people provide the most accurate information. We compare the performance of various small-group estimates to standard Wisdom of Crowds analysis, and find that priming people, or placing them in a cooperative group setting, is less effective than averaging the independent estimates of individuals. We also find, however, that it is possible to extract relatively more information from the decisions people make in a competitive group setting, using cognitive models of their decision-making.",>Michael Lee>Jenny Shi,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0334/index.html

We introduce a Bayesian model which incorporates individual differences in memory ability, as well as informative prior knowledge about event sequences, as measured in a separate experiment. We show how adding prior knowledge leads to improved model reconstructions, especially in small groups of error-prone individuals.

These simulations indicate that agents learn when and where to move their eyes to attain maximal reading efficiency, generalize this behavior from training sentences to novel test sentences, and use word length to predict word-identification times and thereby make optimal decisions about when to initiate saccadic programmingeven if word length is only moderately predictive of word-identification times.

2010,INFLUENCE OF GRAMMATICAL GENDER ON DEDUCTIVE REASONING ABOUT SEX-SPECIFIC PROPERTIES OF ANIMALS,"Grammatical gender is independent of biological sex for the majority of animal names (e.g., a male giraffe is grammatically treated as feminine). However, there is apparent semantic motivation for grammatical gender classes, especially in mapping human terms to gender classes. This research investigated whether this apparent motivation in mapping between grammar and biological sex affects deductive inference in German speakers. We identified two contexts in which speakers unconsciously over-generalize the grammar-semantics mapping to make inappropriate deductive inferences about sex-specific biological properties. They tended to erroneously accept deductions when the sex in the premise and the grammatical gender of the target animal agreed. The sex-gender agreement affected the inference even when the sex of the target was explicitly indicated (e.g., die[FEM] männliche (male) Giraffe). Experiment 2 further suggested that these effects occur only when the gender-marking article accompanied the noun.

We use the empirical results of two jury decision-making experiments to compare two different models of human belief updating: the belief-adjustment model and the quantum inference model.

2010,Information Relevance in Pseudodiagnostic Reasoning,"When faced with two competing hypotheses, people sometime prefer to look at multiple sources of information in support of one hypothesis rather than to establish the diagnostic value of a single piece of information for the two hypotheses. This is termed pseudodiagnostic reasoning, and is understood to reflect a pervasive confirmation bias. Past research suggests that diagnostic reasoning may be more easily fostered when participants seek data to help in the selection of one of two competing courses of action as opposed to situations where they seek data to help inferring which of two competing hypotheses is true. In the experiment reported here, we provide the first empirical evidence demonstrating that the facilitating effect observed in action problems is driven by considerations of information relevance, reasoners motivations and the numerical value of the first piece of information presented.

Although this difference is sometimes attributed to childrens difficulties in processing and pragmatic understanding, this paper explores the hypothesis that children fail to compute scalar implicatures because they lack knowledge about relevant lexical alternatives to words like some. Four-year-olds were shown pictures in which two objects fit a description and a third object did not, and were asked to judge the truth value of statements that relied on context-independent alternatives (e.g. only some of the toys are on the table) or contextual alternatives (e.g. only the drum and the ball are on the table). Children computed scalar implicatures only in the case of contextual alternatives, and only when the statements were grammatically strengthened, supporting the hypothesis that childrens difficulties with scalar implicature result from a lack of knowledge of the relevant alternatives.",>Neon Brooks>Alan Bale>David Barner,">University of Chicago>Concordia University>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0343/index.html

2010,Linking meaning to language: linguistic universals and variation,"To use natural language, speakers must map the participants in events or states in the world onto grammatical roles. There remains considerable disagreement about the nature of these so-called linking rules (Levin & Rappaport Hovav, 2005). In order to probe the nature of linking rules, we investigate verbs of psychological state, which demonstrate complex linking patterns both within and between languages. We find that the typical duration of the psychological state guides the application of linking rules to novel verbs in both English and Japanese, consistent with a universal constraint. Nonetheless, there are marked differences in the baseline preferences for the individual linking rules across the two languages. We discuss these findings both in terms of theories of exceptionless linking rules and accounts on which linking rules are governed by probabilistic biases as well as cross-linguistic variation.",>Joshua Hartshorne>Tim O'Donnell>Yasutada Sudo>Miki Uruwashi>Jesse Snedeker,>Harvard University>Harvard University>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Waseda University>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0345/index.html
2010,Comprehending Negated Sentences With Binary States and Locations,"Language theorists have argued that processing negated statements (The eagle is not in the sky,) differs from affirmative propositions. However, evidence for these claims comes from studies that did not control for the possibility of numerous states (e.g., the eagle is perched on a branch or on the ground). Here, we explore whether constraining this number of possibilities provides more information about processing negation. In Experiment 1, the stimuli described binary states. For example, a coin can be either heads up or tails up; if it is not heads up it is necessarily tails up. In Experiment 2, preceding contexts constrained the number of possible locations of a negated proposition. The results, consistent with earlier evidence for negations increased complexity, offer new data suggesting that perceptual simulation of negated proposition may be experimentally detected when the states or locations are sufficiently constrained, using binary states or contextual descriptions.",>Sarah Anderson>Stephanie Huette>Teenie Matlock>Michael Spivey,">Cornell University>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0346/index.html
2010,On-line Interactions of Context and Grammatical Aspect,"What role does grammatical aspect play in the time course of understanding motion events? Although processing differences between past progressive (was walking) and simple past (walked) aspect suggest differences in prominence of certain semantic properties, details about the temporal dynamics of aspect processing have been largely ignored. The current work uses mouse-tracking (Spivey, Grosjean, & Knoblich, 2005) to explore motor output in response to contextual descriptions and aspectual forms. Participants heard descriptions of terrain (difficult or easy) and motion events described with either the past progressive or simple past while placing a character into a scene to match this description. Overall, terrain descriptions modulated responses to past progressive more than to simple past in the region of the screen corresponding to the path. These results, which suggest that perceptual simulation plays a role in the interpretation of grammatical form, provide new insights into the understanding of event descriptions.",>Sarah Anderson>Teenie  Matlock>Michael  Spivey,">Cornell University>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0347/index.html
2010,Anaphors and Local Coherences,"We present two visual world studies indicating that local syn- tactic coherences interact with binding constraints (Chomsky, 1981) of both reflexives and pronouns. Gazes to depicted ref- erents or events suggest that when sentences containing a local coherence with a pronoun or reflexive are presented, locally coherent antecedents become activated. Our results strengthen the assumption that local syntactic coherences are interpreted and extend the effect to online anaphora resolution and com- plementary binding constraints.",>Lars Konieczny>Helmut Weldle>Sascha Wolfer>Daniel Müller>Peter Baumann,>Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg>Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg>Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg>Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg>Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg ,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0348/index.html
2010,Self-directed speech alters visual processing,"A major part of learning a language is learning connections between spoken words and their referents in the world. An open question concerns the consequence this learning has for cognition and perception. According to the label feedback hy-pothesis (Lupyan, 2007), processing a verbal label can change ongoing perceptual processing, e.g., actually hearing chair compared to simply thinking about a chair temporarily makes the visual system a better chair detector. Here, we test wheth-er engaging in a non-communicative verbal actspeaking to oneselfalso affects visual processing. Participants searched for common objects, sometimes being asked to speak the tar-gets name aloud. Speaking facilitated search, but only when there was a strong association between the name and the vis-ual target. Speaking appeared to hurt performance when there was even a slight discrepancy between the name and the tar-get. Together these results speak to the power of words to evoke associated visual information.",>Gary Lupyan>Daniel Swingley,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0349/index.html
2010,Is categorical perception really verbally mediated perception?,"Recent research has argued that categorization is strongly tied to language processing. For example, language (in the form of verbal category labels) has been shown to influence perceptual discriminations of color (Winawer et al., 2007). However, does this imply that categorical perception is essentially verbally mediated perception? The present study extends recent findings in our lab showing that categorical perception can occur even in the absence of overt labels. In particular, we evaluate the degree to which certain interference tasks (verbal, spatial) reduce the effect of learned categorical perception for complex visual stimuli (faces). Contrary to previous findings, our results show that a verbal interference task does not disrupt learned categorical perception effects for faces. Our results are interpreted in light of the ongoing debate about the role of language in categorization. In particular, we suggest that at least a sub-set of categorical perception effects may be effectively language-free.",>Andrew Hendrickson>George Kachergis>Todd Gureckis>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University>New York University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0350/index.html
2010,Visual Similarity Effects in Categorical Search,"The factors affecting search guidance to categorical targets are largely unknown. We asked how visual similarity relationships between random-category distractors and two target classes, teddy bears and butterflies, affects search guidance. Experiment 1 used a web-based task to collect visual similarity rankings between these target classes and random objects, from which we created search displays having either high-similarity distractors, low-similarity distractors, or mixed displays with high, medium, and lowsimilarity distractors. Subjects made faster manual responses and fixated fewer distractors on low-similarity displays compared to high. On mixed trials, first fixations were more frequent on high-similarity distractors (bear=49%; butterfly=58%) than low-similarity distractors (bear=9%; butterfly=12%). Experiment 2 used the same high/low/mixed conditions, but now these conditions were created using similarity estimates from a computer-vision model that ranked objects in terms of color, texture, and shape similarity. The same patterns were found, suggesting that categorical search is indeed guided by visual similarity.",>Robert Alexander>Wei Zhang>Gregory Zelinsky,">Department of Psychology, Stony Brook University>Microsoft Corporation>Department of Psychology, Stony Brook University, Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0351/index.html
2010,Social Cues Support Learning about Objects from Statistics in Infancy,"In laboratory experiments, infants can learn patterns of features that co-occur (e.g., Fiser & Aslin, 2002). This finding leaves two questions unanswered: What do infants do with the knowledge acquired from such statistical learning, and which patterns do infants attend to in the noisy and cluttered world outside of the laboratory? Here, we show that 9-month-old infants form expectations about co-occurring features remaining fused, an essential skill for object individuation and recognition (e.g., Goldstone, 2000; Schyns & Rodet, 1997). We also show that though social cues may temporarily detract attention away from learning events, they appear to stimulate infants to display learning better in complex situations than when infants learn on their own without attention cues. These findings suggest that infants can use feature co-occurrence to learn about objects and that social cues shape such foundational learning in a noisy environment during infancy.",>Rachel Wu>Alison Gopnik>Daniel Richardson>Natasha Kirkham,">Birkbeck, University of London>University of California at Berkeley>University College London>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0352/index.html
2010,Electrophysiological Evidence for Multiple Representations of Number in the Human Brain,"In adult human brains, the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus plays a large role in representing numeric magnitude. In children and non-human primates, however, frontal cortex may play a larger role. We hypothesized that there is a link between observed developmental changes in locus of representation (frontal to parietal) and type of representation used (logarithmic to linear). Participants were presented with number lines and asked to judge accuracy of linear, logarithmic, or log-linear placements. Consistent with hypotheses, event-related potentials generally revealed greatest parietal N1 amplitudes for linear placements and greatest frontal P3 amplitude for logarithmic placements. Additionally, effects of linear placements on cortical activity were moderated by numerical magnitude: parietal N1 amplitudes decreased with magnitude, whereas frontal P3 amplitudes increased with magnitude. These results suggest adults possess logarithmic and linear representations of number, and when logarithmic representations were elicited; there was greater involvement of frontal cortex.",>Frank Kanayet>John Opfer>William Cunningham,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0353/index.html
2010,The perception of number from long-term memory,"The perception of numerosity is supported by two systems: an exact system for small quantities, and an approximate system for large quantities. Two properties arise from the combination of these two systems: the accuracy of numerosity judgments changes qualitatively above the capacity limit for exact representations, and the ability to discriminate two quantities depends on the numerical distance between the quantities and the relationship of this distance to the absolute magnitudes. These well-characterized aspects of number cognition have typically been studied in judgments of numerosity based on visual arrays. Across four experiments we demonstrate remarkably similar effects in numerosity judgments based on incidental long-term memory. These results suggest that similar mechanisms and constraints may operate when estimating numerosity from representations of external sensory input and internal representations derived from long-term memory.",>Jiaying Zhao>Nicholas Turk-Browne,>Princeton University>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0354/index.html
2010,Mapping number words to approximate magnitudes: associative learning or structure mapping?,"How do we link number words to the magnitudes they represent? We investigated the roles of associative learning and structure mapping in linking the Approximate Number System to number words. Four tasks demonstrated that individuals have strong associative links between magnitudes and number words for relatively small sets, but have weak associative links for larger sets. These results point to multiple mechanisms for the mapping of number words to magnitudes.",>Jess Sullivan>David Barner,>UCSD>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0355/index.html
2010,Analogue Magnitudes and Knower-Levels: Re-Visiting the Variability Argument,"What cognitive system(s) provides the conceptual resources that inform number-word learning? Le Corre and Carey (2007) made a strong set of arguments that the answer cannot be the analogue magnitude system. Here we re-examine the most powerful of these arguments, based on scalar variability (the standard deviation of answers growing linearly with the mean), which is a signature of the analogue magnitude system. Using adult data, we show that a certain additional nuance is needed to understand this signature: it applies to a hidden continuous part of the system, and not always to the discrete integers that people produce. We then show that this new description, combined with the knower-level framework, is consistent with a corpus of child data: young children do show scalar variability in their responses when asked how many items are on a card. This points towards a role for the analogue magnitude system in number-word learning.",>James Negen>Barbara Sarnecka,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0356/index.html
2010,Integrating Reinforcement Learning with Models of Representation Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great promise as a model of learning in complex, dynamic tasks, for both humans and artificial systems. However, the effectiveness of RL models depends strongly on the choice of state representation, because this determines how knowledge is generalized among states. We introduce a framework for integrating psychological mechanisms of representation learning that allows RL to autonomously adapt its representation to suit its needs and thereby speed learning. One such model is formalized, based on learned selective attention among stimulus dimensions. The model significantly outperforms standard RL models and provides a good fit to human data.",>Matt Jones>Fabian Cañas,>University of Colorado>University of Colorado,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0357/index.html
2010,Attention and Reinforcement Learning: Constructing Representations from Indirect Feedback,"Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great promise as a theory of learning in complex, dynamic tasks. However, the learning performance of RL models depends strongly on how stimuli are represented, because this determines how knowledge is generalized among stimuli. We propose a mechanism by which RL autonomously constructs representations that suit its needs, using selective attention among stimulus dimensions to bootstrap off of internal value estimates and improve those same estimates, thereby speeding learning. Results of a behavioral experiment support this proposal, by showing people can learn selective attention for actions that do not lead directly to reward, through internally generated feedback. The results are cast in a larger framework for integrating RL with psychological mechanisms of representation learning.",>Fabián Cañas>Matt Jones,>University of Colorado>University of Colorado,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0358/index.html
2010,Learning to selectively attend,"How is reinforcement learning possible in a high-dimensional world? Without making any assumptions about the structure of the state space, the amount of data required to effectively learn a value function grows exponentially with the state space's dimensionality. However, humans learn to solve high-dimensional problems much more rapidly than would be expected under this scenario. This suggests that humans employ inductive biases to guide (and accelerate) their learning. Here we propose one particular bias---sparsity---that ameliorates the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional state spaces, and present experimental evidence that humans can exploit sparsity information when it is available.",>Samuel Gershman>Jonathan Cohen>Yael Niv,>Princeton University>Princeton University>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0359/index.html

We call membership in both categories in a paradox integrative categorization.

2010,Theories of God: Explanatory Coherence in a Non-Scientific Domain,"Public representations of God range from the highly anthropomorphic to the highly abstract, and the present study explored whether differences in the interpretation of those representations are correlated with differences in ones religious beliefs and religious practices more generally. American adults of varying ages and religious backgrounds completed a questionnaire that probed their beliefs about a wide range of religious matters, including prayer, ritual, worship, sin, cosmogenesis, anthropogenesis, angels, Satan, Heaven, and Hell. Participants were divided into two groups based on their propensity to anthropomorphize God in a property-attribution task, and their responses were analyzed for internal consistency. Overall, the two groups exhibited explanatorily coherent, yet qualitatively different, patterns of beliefs and practices  patterns interpreted contrastively as a humanistic theology and an existential theology. These findings suggest that individuals religious beliefs are organized in a theory-like manner despite their lack of direct perceptual support.",>Andrew Shtulman,>Occidental College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0363/index.html
2010,The Cultural Transmission of Explanations: Evidence that Teleological Explanations are Preferentially Remembered,"Teleological explanations  explanations in terms of functions, purposes, or goals  are pervasive in religion and feature prominently in intuitive theories about the world, such as theory of mind and folk biology. Previous findings suggest that such explanations reflect a deep, explanatory preference. Here we explore the mechanisms underlying the prevalence and persistence of such explanations, following a method developed by Boyer and Ramble (2001) to examine which religious concepts are likely to survive processes of cultural transmission. Specifically, we test the prediction that novel teleological explanations are remembered better than mechanistic explanations, even when effects of an explanations quality are taken into account. Two experiments support this prediction for artifact and biological trait explanations, but find the opposite pattern for explanations of non-living natural entities.",>Nicholas Gwynne>Tania Lombrozo,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0364/index.html

Adults read strongly or weakly constrained sentences ending in known and unknown (novel) words as electrical brain activity was recorded. Word knowledge was assessed via a lexical decision task where recently seen known and unknown word sentence endings served as primes for related, unrelated, and synonym/identical target words. N400 amplitudes to target words preceded by known word primes were reduced by prime relatedness. Critically, N400 amplitudes to targets preceded by novel words also varied with prime relatedness, but only if they initially appeared in highly constraining sentences. These results demonstrate that electrical brain activity accompanying one-shot contextual word learning is modulated by contextual constraint and reveals a rapid neural process that can integrate information about word meanings into the mental lexicon.",>Arielle Borovsky>Jeffrey Elman>Marta  Kutas,>UCSD>UCSD>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0365/index.html
2010,Fixation durations in first-pass reading reflect uncertainty about word identity,"In reading, it is often assumed that words are recognized sufficiently quickly, accurately, and unambiguously that downstream processes may proceed with perfect information about word identity. For example, word predictability is believed to affect early reading time measures, yet a word's predictability cannot be calculated without knowledge of the word's identity. We argue that such information is not, in general, available to the language processing system, and that it proceeds with only probabilistic information about word identity. We predict therefore that what have been analyzed previously as predictability effects must instead be based on noisy estimates of word predictability that are influenced by the predictability of visually similar words (neighbors). We test this prediction by building a Bayesian model of visual word recognition, using it to compute the `average neighborhood surprisal' of words in a corpus, and testing the ability of this novel measure to explain human reading time data.",>Nathaniel Smith>Roger Levy,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0366/index.html

The speaker, for instance, is supposed to say no more, but also no less than is necessary in a given conversational context (Maxim of Quantity). The present study looks at how language users react when this pragmatic assumption is violated. Participants were presented with written mini-dialogues while their ERPs (Event-Related brain Potentials) were measured. Dialogues in the violation condition, where the answer did not meet the quantity requirements, differed from control dialogues in three different time-windows, time-locked to the presentation of a critical word.

2010,How much for a transitive? Subtle linguistic cues influence blame and punishment,"When bad things happen, how do we decide who is to blame and how much they should be punished? In this paper we examined whether subtly different linguistic descriptions of accidents influence how much people blame and punish those involved. In three studies, participants judged how much people involved in particular accidents should be blamed and how much they should have to pay for resulting damage. The language used to describe the accidents differed subtly between conditions: either agentive (transitive) or non-agentive (intransitive) verb forms were used. Agentive descriptions led participants to attribute more blame and request higher financial penalties than non-agentive descriptions. Further, linguistic framing influenced judgments even when participants reasoned about a well-known event like the wardrobe malfunction of Super Bowl 2004. Importantly, this effect of language held even when people were able to see the event for themselves on video. These results demonstrate that even when people have rich established knowledge and visual information about events, linguistic framing can shape event construal, with important real-world consequences. Subtle differences in linguistic descriptions can change the way people construe what happened and how they attribute blame and dole out punishment.",>Caitlin Fausey>Lera  Boroditsky,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0370/index.html
2010,Can mirror-reading reverse the flow of time?,"Across cultures, people conceptualize time as if it flows along a horizontal timeline, but the direction of this implicit timeline is culture-specific: in cultures with left-to-right orthography (e.g., English-speaking cultures) time appears to flow rightward, but in cultures with right-to-left orthography (e.g., Arabic-speaking cultures) time flows leftward. Can orthography influence implicit time representations independent of other cultural and linguistic factors? Native Dutch speakers performed a space-time congruity task with the instructions and stimuli written in either standard Dutch or mirror-reversed Dutch. Participants in the Standard Dutch condition were fastest to judge past-oriented phrases by pressing the left button and future-oriented phrases by pressing the right button. Participants in the Mirror-Reversed Dutch condition showed the opposite pattern of reaction times, consistent with results found previously in native Arabic and Hebrew speakers.

2010,"Implicit spatial length modulates time estimates, but not vice versa.","How are space and time represented in the human mind? Here we evaluate two theoretical proposals, one suggesting a symmetric relationship between space and time (ATOM theory) and the other an asymmetric relationship (metaphor theory). In Experiment 1, Dutch-speaking participants saw 7-letter nouns that named concrete objects of various spatial lengths (tr. pencil, bench, footpath) and estimated how much time they remained on the screen. In Experiment 2, participants saw nouns naming temporal events of various durations (tr. blink, party, season) and estimated the words spatial length. The implicit length encoded in object nouns modulated time estimates, but the implicit duration encoded in event nouns did not affect estimates of spatial length. Nouns that named short objects were judged to remain on the screen for a shorter time, and nouns that named longer objects to remain for a longer time. By contrast, variations in the duration of the event nouns referents had no effect on judgments of the words spatial length on the screen. This asymmetric pattern of cross-dimensional interference cannot be attributed to differences in the discriminability or perceptual salience of space and time in the stimuli.

However, there is a great deal of variability across studies in childrens bias to reject second labels. In this study, we investigated three possible factors affecting this variability including age, task, and parental input in a cross-sectional sample of children from 12- to 28-months-old. We show that children reject second labels differently depending on their age, task demands, and the amount and type of parental input. Importantly, there is also a correlation between the ways in which parents use second labels and childrens acceptance of first and second labels for objects.

2010,Effects of simultaneously presented visual information on adults and infants auditory statistical learning,"Infant and adult learners are able to identify word boundaries in fluent speech using statistical information. Similarly, learners are able to use statistical information to identify word-object associations. Successful language learning requires both feats. In this series of experiments, we presented adults and infants with audio-visual input from which it was possible to identify both word boundaries and word-object relations. Adult learners were able to identify both kinds of statistical relations from the same input. Moreover, their learning was actually facilitated by the presence of two simultaneously present relations. Eight-month-old infants, however, do not appear to benefit from the presence of regular relations between words and object. Adults, like 8-month-olds, did not benefit from regular audio-visual correspondences when they were tested with tones, rather than linguistic input. These differences in learning outcomes across age and input suggest that both developmental and stimulus-based constraints affect statistical learning.",>Erik Thiessen,>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0376/index.html
2010,Gesture in language: How sound symbolic words are processed in the brain,"In traditional linguistics, it has been assumed that the sounds of words are not related to their semantic contents, and that meanings of words are not directly linked to sensory systems. Nevertheless, many languages have a word class in which the sound and meaning of words are systematically related. In this study, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scanned brain activity in adult Japanese-speakers while they were seeing locomotion videos together with sound symbolic mimetic words, non-sound symbolic adverbs or verbs. Mimetic words were neurally processed differently from non-sound symbolic adverbs and verbs: We identified extensive bi-hemispheric activations in the regions typically associated with nonverbal cognitive processes for mimetic words but not for non-symbolic verbs or adverbs. The results suggest that mimetic words, by their direct sound-meaning link, have dual neural status both as linguistic symbols and non-linguistic iconic symbols that are directly linked to sensory experience.",>Mamiko Arata>Mutsumi Imai>Jiro Okuda>Hiroyuki Okada>Tetsuya Matsuda,">Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University at Shonan-Fujisawa, Japan>Faculty of Environment and Information Studies, Keio University at Shonan-Fujisawa, Japan>Faculty of computer Science and Engineering, KyotoSangyo University, Japan>Department of Engineering, Tamagawa University, Japan>Tamagawa University Brain Science Institute, Tamagawa University, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0377/index.html
2010,"Word Order, Case Forms and Structural Priming in Czech Children's Comprehension","Two groups of Czech children, 3-year-olds (N=28) and 5-year-olds (N=26), participated in a preferential looking experiment testing their comprehension of simple transitive sentences and their susceptibility to structural priming. Four temporarily ambiguous target sentences were presented, two with the canonical SVO word order, two with OVS word order, which is possible but marked in Czech. Each target sentence was preceded by an unambiguous prime sentence with SVO or OVS word order. In 3-year-olds, the presence of OVS primes reduced the garden-path effect observed in the OVS sentences. In 5-year olds, there were no significant effects of structural priming. In unambiguous prime sentences, 5-year olds showed the same level of comprehension in both the canonical and non-canonical sentences. The results suggest that 3-year-olds represent the abstract relationship between agent and patient roles and word order.

2010,Modeling Implicit and Explicit Processes in Recursive Sequence Structure Learning,"Recursive structure is viewed as a central property of human language, yet the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition and processing of this structure are subject to intense debate. The artificial grammar learning paradigm has shed light onto syntax acquisition, but has rarely been applied to the more complex, context-free grammars that are needed to represent recursive structure. We adapt the artificial grammar serial reaction time task to study the online acquisition of recursion, and compare human performance to the predictions made by a number of computational language models, chosen to reflect multiple levels and types of syntactic complexity (n-grams, hidden markov models, simple recurrent networks, and Bayesian-induced probabilistic context-free grammars). Evidence is found for a dissociation between explicit and implicit mechanisms of sequence processing, with the SRN more highly correlated with implicit performance, and the PCFG more correlated with explicit awareness of the sequential structure.",>Jamie Alexandre,">University of California, San Diego (UCSD)",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0379/index.html
2010,The Impact of Starting Small on the Learnability of Recursion,"Recursion is argued to be the crucial property distinguishing human and non-human primates language learning faculty (Hauser, Chomsky, & Fitch, 2002). Recently, 2 studies (Bahlmann & Friederici, 2006; de Vries, Monaghan, Knecht, & Zwitserlood, 2008), which investigated the learnability of a recursive artificial grammar of the type of AnBn, used the same material but reported divergent results. We propose that the organization of the linguistic environment crucially determines learnability of the recursive structure, and that this factor might offer some explanation to the incompatible findings. In a grammaticality judgment task using the same materials as in Bahlmann and Friederici (2006) and de Vries et al.s (2008), we found significantly better performance when the training input was arranged in a starting small fashion, than when it was organized randomly.",>Jun Lai>Fenna  Poletiek ,>Leiden University>Leiden University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0380/index.html
2010,Dissociating Sources of Knowledge in Artificial Grammar Learning,"Previous studies have suggested that individuals use both implicit and explicit, as well as rule and exemplar-based knowledge, to make grammaticality judgments in artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks. Experiment 1 explored the importance of explicit mechanisms in the learning of exemplar and rule-based information by using a dual-task during AGL training. We utilized a balanced chunk strength grammar, assuring an equal proportion of explicit exemplar-based cues (i.e. chunks) between grammatical and non-grammatical test items. Experiment 2 explored the importance of perceptual cues by changing letters between AGL training and test, while still incorporating the dual-task design and balanced chunk strength grammar used in Experiment 1. Results indicated that participants with a working memory load learned the grammar in Experiment 1 just as well as the single-task no-load group, presumably by relying solely on implicit learning mechanisms. However, changing the letters from training to test resulted in no significant learning for dual-task participants in Experiment 2, suggesting that exemplar-based perceptual cues may the major contributor to implicit knowledge. Overall, the results suggest that implicit and explicit mechanisms for learning rule-based and exemplar-based information may both contribute to AGL via four independent, parallel routes, providing a new framework for understanding the complex dynamic of learning in AGL tasks.",>MIchelle Hendricks>Christopher Conway>Ronald Kellogg,>Saint Louis University>Saint Louis University>Saint Louis University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0381/index.html
2010,Why Streaks Are Special: The Time of Patterns,"People seek for patterns and pay particular attention to streaks even when they are generated by a random process. The present paper examines statistics of pattern time in sequences generated by Bernoulli trials. We demonstrate that streak patterns possess some statistical properties that make them uniquely distinguishable from other patterns. Because of the uncontaminated continuity, streak patterns have the largest amount of self-overlap, resulting in the longest waiting time and the largest variance of interarrival times. We then discuss the psychological implications of pattern time such as in memory encoding and perception of randomness.",>Yanlong Sun>Hongbin Wang,>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0382/index.html
2010,Social Learning and Cumulative Mutual Improvement in a Networked Group,"We used a simple problem-solving game task to study imitation and innovation in groups of participants. Guesses were composed of multiple elements with linear and interactive effects on score, and score feedback was provided after each of a number of rounds. Participants were allowed to view and imitate the guesses of others during each round, and the score information accompanying others guesses was either shown or hidden in two conditions. When scores were not visible, social learning was impeded; participants were less efficient in their searching of the problem space and achieved lower performance overall. When scores were visible, higher performance was observed, and results indicated a more equitable sharing of productive exploration among participants within groups as a result of selective imitation and cross-participant cumulative mutual innovations.",>Thomas Wisdom>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0383/index.html
2010,Social Context Effects on the Impact of Category Labels,"We explore whether social context affects how labels (relative to other features) affect category learning. We taught 104 participants four novel categories using a feature inference task. In a between-participants design, we manipulated: 1) the social context of the task (social context vs. on the computer); and 2) which dimension of the category members could be used to perfectly predict the target feature: the category label, a biased feature (which is salient and already associated with the target feature in the correct way) or a non-biased feature (which is less salient and not already associated with the target feature in any way). Learning curves were used to assess whether participants assumed that labels were uniquely helpful compared to other features. The results suggest that the extent to which labels are privileged depends on the context in which the category learning task is presented. When the task is social, people learn quickly regardless of whether a label or another feature is the most informative. When the task is not, both novel labels and biased features are more useful than non-biased features.",>Rachel Stephens>Amy Perfors>Daniel Navarro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0384/index.html
2010,Pedagogical Cues Influence Children's Inductive Inference and Exploratory Play,"A hallmark of human cognition is the ability to learn from othersboth via language and via non-linguistic cues. Children are sensitive to actions done for their benefit, treating pedagogical acts as conveying important information (Csibra & Gergely, 2009). The current research tapped childrens exploration to investigate whether seeing a causal property either demonstrated pedagogically or produced accidentally influences childrens expectations about that propertys extension to other kind members. Experiment 1 found striking differences in 3- and 4-year-olds exploration when a property was demonstrated intentionally rather than accidentally. Experiment 2 replicated this effect while also investigating possible influences of the emotional valence of causal events and the salience of property information. These experiments reveal that preschoolers use pedagogical cues to make inferences about generalizability and guide their exploration.",>Lucas Butler>Ellen Markman,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0385/index.html
2010,The Facilitative Effect of Context on Second-Order Social Reasoning,"This paper is about higher-order social reasoning such as I think that you think that I think . Previous research has shown that such reasoning seriously deteriorates in complex social interactions. It has been suggested that reasoning can be facilitated greatly if an abstract logical problem is embedded in a context. This has not yet been tested for higher-order social reasoning. We presented participants with strategic games that demand higher-order social reasoning. The games were embedded in the context of a marble game. Participants performed really well, that is, almost at ceiling. We argue that context has a facilitative effect on higher order-social reasoning.",>Ben Meijering>Leendert Van Maanen>Hedderik Van Rijn>Rineke Verbrugge,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0386/index.html
2010,Phonological instability in young adult poor readers,"Phonology is held to play a central role in typical reading development (Shankweiler et al., 1979) and sensory or phonological deficits are often held to be a primary cause of reading disability (Snowling, 2008). However, little is known about the nature of phonology at the endpoint of atypical reading development -- that is, in adult poor readers. We examined the time course of (auditory) lexical activation, competition, and learning in a community sample with a high proportion of poor readers in two experiments. In Experiment 1, contrary to our expectations, we found that poor readers were more sensitive to subphonemic coarticulatory cues than better readers. In Experiment 2, we examined the time course of word learning along with the time course of phonological competition. Poor readers differed from better readers in the trajectory of learning, and also in phonological competition: typical readers exhibited strong competition between rhymes, but poor readers did not. Simulations with a computational model suggest that instability in phonological organization (simulated via reduced lateral inhibition) can explain differences in both studies in counter-intuitive ways, shedding new light on an old problem.",>James Magnuson>Anuenue Kukona>David Braze>Clint Johns>Julie Van Dyke>Whiteny Tabor>Kenneth Pugh>Einar Mencl,>University of Connecticut and Haskins Laboratories>University of Connecticut and Haskins Laboratories>Haskins Laboratories>Haskins Laboratories>Haskins Laboratories>University of Connecticut and Haskins Laboratories>University of Connecticut and Haskins Laboratories>Haskins Laboratories,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0387/index.html
2010,Phonological Encoding in Word Naming and Word Typing,"The process of phonological encoding was investigated in primed word naming and word typing with Chinese monosyllabic words. The target words shared or did not share the onset consonants with the prime words. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was 100 ms or 300 ms. Typing required the participants to enter the phonetic letters of the target word, which correspond roughly to the onset and the rhyme of the words syllable. Regardless of SOAs, response times were shorter in the related condition than in the unrelated condition (an onset priming effect) for word typing, but were similar for word naming. The results suggest that naming and typing in Chinese may involve somewhat different phonological encoding processes even though both tasks require accessing the phonological codes. It is hypothesized that phonological encoding in Chinese is syllable driven in word naming, but is segment driven in word typing.",>Jenn-Yeu Chen>Cheng-Yi Li,>National Cheng Kung University>National Cheng Kung University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0388/index.html
2010,Visual and Task characteristics may explain hemispheric asymmetry in visual word recognition,"Previous studies proposed that the left hemisphere (LH) lateralization in English word recognition is because of the LH superiority in language processing. Nevertheless, Chinese character recognition has been shown to be more bilateral or right hemisphere (RH) lateralized and thus is a counter example of this claim. Through computational modeling, here we show that at least two factors other than language lateralization may influence hemispheric asymmetry in visual word recognition: (1) Visual similarity among words, which can be influenced by the ratio between the alphabet size and the lexicon size and the visual similarity among letters: We show that the more similar the words are in the lexicon, the more high spatial frequency (HSF) information is required to distinguish them, and this leads to more LH lateralization (2) The requirement to decompose a word into letters in order to map them to corresponding phonemes in pronunciation: We show that letter identity mapping requires more HSF information than word identity mapping, and alphabetic reading requires more HSF information than logographic reading; this leads to more LH lateralization in alphabetic languages. These two visual and task characteristic factors alone may explain differences in lateralization between English word and Chinese character recognition, without assuming the influence from language lateralization.",>Kloser Chee Fung Cheung>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao,">Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0389/index.html
2010,Effects of Near and Distant Phonological Neighbors on Picture Naming,"Many studies have examined the effects of co-activation of similar words (neighbors) during processing, with some reporting facilitative effects and others reporting inhibitory effects. Attractor dynamics has provided a promising integrated account in which distant semantic neighbors (moderately similar words) tend to facilitate processing and near semantic neighbors (highly similar words) tend to inhibit processing. This framework was extended to phonological neighbor effects on the accuracy of word production. For aphasic patients (N=62) and speeded young controls (N=32), picture naming was more accurate for words with many distant phonological neighbors (words with matching onsets) and less accurate for words with a near phonological neighbor (homophones). In addition, the sizes of the facilitative and inhibitory effects were correlated, suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for both effects are functionally integrated. These results extend an attractor dynamics framework that predicts facilitative effects of distant neighbors and inhibitory effects of near neighbors.",>Daniel Mirman>Audrey K. Kittredge>Gary S.

Contrary to the well-known study of Tohill & Holyoak (2000), where the anxiety state impeded the analogical mapping, in this study participants in the anxiety state were significantly more inclined to produce a relational choice which is structurally consistent with the target, even though this alternative was more superficially dissimilar to the target. This result was obtained in a match-to-sample paradigm. The implications for the theory of how anxiety influences analogy-making are discussed and it is argued in favor of a more detailed and specific approach to studying the influence of anxiety on each component mechanism of analogy-making.",>Veselina Feldman>Penka Hristova>Boicho Kokinov,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0391/index.html

Similarly, emotionally valenced faces are temporally overestimated when compared to neutral ones (Droit-Volet, Bruno, & Niedenthal, 2004). In the current study, participants embodied emotion via mood induction prior to temporal estimation of neutrally valenced faces. Valenced mood induction led to overestimation of the duration of neutral faces.

Predictions of this model were tested and pit against Helsons (1964) adaptation-level theory, Parduccis (1995) range-frequency theory, and Haubensaks (1992) consistency model using a paradigm in which sequences periodically improved (i.e., improved for n trials, returned to the original state on a single trial, and improved for n trials again) or periodically deteriorated by small or large amounts. The results were consistent with the predictions of the proposed CID model of sequence effects and inconsistent with adaptation-level theory, range-frequency theory, and the consistency model.",>Jessica Choplin>Megan Lombardi,>DePaul University>DePaul University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0394/index.html

Other authors have found that the relationship between distracting and relevant information can influence how well distractors are ignored. Our study hypothesized that a) larger cognitive load would (as previously shown) hinder reaction time on a selective attention task, b) that distractors (words) semantically related to the words being held in memory (as part of the cognitive load manipulation) would be more distracting than unrelated and neutral distracters. The findings instead showed that unrelated distractors were more distracting.",>Rebecca Weast>Nicole Neiman,>Franklin and Marshall College>Franklin and Marshall College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0395/index.html
2010,Is perceptual acuity asymmetric in isolated word recognition? Evidence from an ideal-observer reverse-engineering approach,"An asymmetrical optimal viewing position (OVP) effect in isolated word recognition has been well documented, such that recognition speed and accuracy are highest when the point of fixation within the word is slightly to the left of center. However, there remains disagreement as to the source of the asymmetry in the OVP effect. Accounts based on perceptual acuity and on lexical constraint have been difficult to tease apart. Here we take a novel approach, constructing an ideal-observer model of isolated word recognition which takes into account word frequency information and thus intrinsically accounts for the role of lexical constraint. Within this model, the perceptual acuity curve is governed by free parameters that can be estimated from purely behavioral response data from word recognition experiments. Fitting our model to the experimental data, our model results support the position that the perceptual acuity curve in isolated word recognition is indeed asymmetric.",>Nathaniel Smith>Wen-Hsuan Chan>Roger Levy,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0396/index.html
2010,Are grunters cheaters? The effects of grunting when judging the direction of a tennis shot,"There is a chorus of complaints that many professional tennis players who grunt when striking the ball gain an unfair advantage because the sound of the grunt distracts their opponent. However, scientific investigations of human attention and performance, specifically with regard to sound-vision interactions, would seem to predict that a grunting sound should help because it will draw attention to the visual event of a ball being struck. We tested the argument that a grunt has a negative impact by requiring participants to view videos of a professional hitting a ball to either side of a tennis court with or without a grunt. The task was to respond as quickly as possible to the balls direction. Grunting interfered with performance making responses slower and less accurate. The competitive advantage afforded to the grunting player is potentially profound.

2010,Children's Inductive Inference with Synonymous Labels,"Prior research indicates that young children can generalize object properties on the basis of category information when it is conveyed by identical labels or semantically similar labels at the same level of taxonomy (i.e., synonyms) (Gelman & Markman, 1986). However, in previous research semantic similarity was confounded with co-occurrence probability. Therefore, it is possible that synonym-based induction observed in prior research stemmed from children relying on cues other than the semantic similarity of labels. The present study investigated synonym-based induction with labels that do and do not co-occur in child-directed speech. Results indicated that adults made inferences on the basis of the semantic similarity of labels regardless of co-occurrence probability. In contrast, 4-year-old children generalized based on synonymous labels at above chance levels only when synonyms co-occurred in child-directed speech.",>Bryan Matlen>Anna Fisher>Karrie Godwin,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0398/index.html
2010,Development of Relational Reasoning with Semantically Similar Labels,"The present study explored childrens ability to utilize synonymous labels during relational reasoning. In Experiment 1, 4- to 5-year-old children and adults were presented with a base pair of related words (e.g., Castle:Rock) and then were given a partially completed target word-pair (Castle:?) that they could complete with a label that made the target word-pair relationally identical to the base word-pair (e.g., Stone). Additional response options included a label thematically related to the first word in the target pair (e.g., King) or an unrelated word (e.g., Milk). Results indicated that adults and 5-year-olds successfully completed the task, whereas 4-year-olds exhibited difficulty. In Experiment 2, 4-year-old children were presented with the same task, however relations were conveyed by identical rather than synonymous labels. Under these conditions, 4-year-old children exhibited no difficulty in either lure condition.

One hundred and forty-five participants solved a series of matchstick arithmetic problems. In one group, participants were given three relatively simple chunk decomposition problems (CD). A second group solved one operator decomposition (OD) problem, involving more constraints, between the baseline CD problem and two later problems. The third group solved three OD problems, similarly placed. Results indicated that successful solution of an OD problem produced negative transfer to subsequent CD problems in the form of longer solution times. Participants who did not successfully solve OD problems did not slow down on subsequent problems; they displayed evidence of positive transfer. The findings were interpreted with reference to theories of constraint relaxation and its relationship to problem solving performance.",>Trina Kershaw>Jason Braasch>Christopher Flynn,>University of Massachusetts Dartmouth>Université de Poitiers>University of Massachusetts Dartmouth,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0400/index.html
2010,A critique of multi-voxel pattern analysis,"Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is a popular analytical technique in neuroscience that involves identifying patterns in fMRI BOLD signal data that are predictive of task conditions. But the technique is also frequently used to make inferences about the regions of the brain that are most important to the tasks in question, and our analysis shows that this is a mistake. MVPA does not provide a reliable guide to what information is being used by the brain during cognitive tasks, nor where that information is. This is due in part to inherent run to run variability in the decision space generated by the classifier, but there are also several other issues, discussed here, that make inference from the characteristics of the learned models to relevant brain activity deeply problematic. These issues have significant implications both for many papers already published, and for how the field uses this technique in the future.",>Michael Anderson>Tim Oates,">Franklin & Marshall College>University of Maryland, Baltimore County",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0401/index.html
2010,"The Origins of Collective Overvaluation: Irrational exuberance emerges from simple, honest and rational individual behavior","The generation of value bubbles is an inherently psychological and social process, where information sharing and individual decisions can affect representations of value. Bubbles occur in many domains, from the stock market, to the runway, to the laboratories of science. Here we seek to understand how psychological and social processes lead representations (i.e., expectations) of value to become divorced from the inherent value, using asset bubbles as an example. Using an agent-based model we explore whether a simple switching rule can generate irrational exuberance, and systematically explore how communication between decision makers influences the speed and intensity of overvaluation. We show that rational and simple individual level rules combined with honest information sharing are sufficient to generate the collective overvaluation characteristic of irrational exuberance. Further, our results demonstrate that simple noise in the exchange of value information leads to rapidly increasing expectations about value, even when no one is engaged in exaggerating their expectations for the assets they own.",>Michael Anderson>C.

2010,A category theory explanation for systematicity,"Classical and Connectionist theories of cognitive architecture ""explain"" systematicity, whereby the capacity for some cognitive behaviors is intrinsically linked to the capacity for others, as a consequence of syntactically and functionally combinatorial representations, respectively. However, both theories depend on ad hoc assumptions to exclude specific architectures - grammars, or Connectionist networks - that do not account for systematicity. By analogy with the Ptolemaic (i.e., geocentric) theory of planetary motion, although either theory can be made to be consistent with the data, both nonetheless fail to explain it (Aizawa, 2003b). Category theory provides an alternative explanation based on the formal concept of adjunction, which consists of a pair of structure preserving maps, called functors. A functor generalizes the notion of a map between representational states to include a map between state transformations (processes). In a formal sense, systematicity is a necessary consequence of a ""higher-order"" theory of cognitive architecture, in contrast to the ""first-order"" theories derived from Classicism or Connectionism. Category theory offers a re-conceptualization for cognitive science, analogous to the one that Copernicus provided for astronomy, where representational states are no longer the center of the cognitive universe - replaced by the relationships between the maps that transform them.",>Steven Phillips>William Wilson,">National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JAPAN>The University of New South Wales, AUSTRALIA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0403/index.html

Whether prior testing improves ones ability to answer related questions, however, is less clear, with some results showing impairment for related information, an effect called retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF; e.g., Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994). Two experiments investigated the use of initial multiple-choice tests on the retention of previously studied prose passages, specifically on the retention of related, but initially nontested information. In both experiments, an incorrect alternative on the initial test served as the correct answer to a related question on the final test. Results demonstrated that the retention of related information can, indeed, be facilitated by initial multiple-choice tests (Experiment 1) and that this benefit is dependant upon using competitive incorrect alternatives (Experiment 2).

Strings of letters can be represented by first building vectors to represent individual letters and then concatenating the letter vectors into a vector of larger dimensionality. Although such a representation works well in selected examples of artificial-grammar learning, it fails in examples that depend on left-to-right serial information. We show that recursive convolution solves the problem by combining item and serial-order information in a stimulus item into a distributed data structure. We import the representations into an established model of human memory. The new scheme succeeds not only in applications that were successful using concatenation but also in applications that depend on left-to-right serial organization.",>Randall K. Jamieson>D. J. K.

Previous studies have shown that East Asians are sensitive to both contextual and focal changes while Americans are sensitive to focal but not contextual changes (Masuda & Nisbett, 2006). This difference was attributed to the fact that Americans have analytical and East Asians have holistic perceptions. This study questions whether Turkish students attention to changes in pictures is more like Americans or East Asians. Half of the study was conducted in Turkey and the other half in America. Participants looked at photographs that flickered back and forth from an original picture and an edited photograph. The photographs were Turkish, American, or Neutral. Half were complex, half were simple, and half the changes were made in the foreground and half in the background. We found that both Turkish and American students found the foreground changes a lot faster than the background changes.

2010,A Bottom-Up Parsing Model of Local Coherence Effects,"Human sentence processing occurs incrementally. Most models of human processing rely on parsers that always build connected tree structures. But according to the theory of Good Enough parsing (Ferreira & Patson, 2007), humans parse sentences using small chunks of local information, not always forming a globally coherent parse. This difference is apparent in the study of local coherence effects (Tabor, Galantucci, & Richardson, 2004), wherein a locally plausible interpretation interferes with the correct global interpretation of a sentence. We present a model that accounts for these effects using a wide-coverage parser that captures the idea of Good Enough parsing. Using Combinatory Categorial Grammar, our parser works bottom-up, enforcing the use of local information only. We model the difficulty of processing a sentence in terms of the probability of a locally coherent reading relative to the probability of the globally coherent reading of the sentence.

2010,When Two Plus Two Does Not Equal Four: Event-Related Potential Responses to Semantically Incongrous Arithmetic Word Problems,"Extensive research measuring event-related brain potentials (ERPs) shows that semantic incongruity is indexed by the N400 effect and syntactic/structural incongruity is indexed by the P600 effect. We used these indices to examine how people coordinate their semantic and arithmetic knowledge when they read simple addition and division word problem sentences (e.g., Twelve roses plus three daisies equals fifteen). Prior work in problem solving has shown that word-problem solutions are modulated by analogical alignment of semantic and arithmetic relations, such that people avoid or commit errors on misaligned problems (e.g., Aligned: Twelve roses plus three daisies equals fifteen; Misaligned: Twelve cookies plus three jars equals fifteen). Here, we found that such analogical alignments modulate the comprehension of word-problem sentences. Specifically, we found that analogically Misaligned semantic relations elicited a P600 effect. Furthermore, an N400 effect was elicited by the last number word of Misaligned problem sentences, even when it was a mathematically correct answer. These results show that analogical alignment between semantic and arithmetic relations can be indexed with the P600 effect and provide a foundation for future ERP work on analogical reasoning.",>Kristie Fisher>Miriam Bassok>Lee Osterhout,>University of Washington>University of Washington>University of Washington,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0411/index.html
2010,Simplifying the Mapping from Referring Expression to Referent in a Conceptual Semantics of Reference,"In Jackendoffs Conceptual Semantics, reference to objects, situations, places, directions, times, manners, and measures is supported, but reference is limited to instances of these conceptual categories. This paper proposes an extension of Jackendoffs referential types along an orthogonal dimension of reference which is cognitively motivated in suggesting the possibility of referring to types, prototypes and exemplars in addition to instances, as well as classes and collections of all referential types and vacuous instances and collections. The paper also introduces a bi-partite distinction between a situation model and the mental universe which helps to explain apparent non-referential uses of referring expressions. The primary motivation for expanding the ontology of referential types and distinguishing the situation model from the mental universe is to simplify the mapping from linguistic expressions to corresponding representations of referential meaning. The viability of this approach hinges on adoption of the mentalist semantics of Jackendoff. There is no direct reference to actual objects in the external world.",>Jerry Ball,>Air Force Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0412/index.html
2010,Toward a Functional Model of Human Language Processing,"This paper describes a computational cognitive model of human language processing under development in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The paper begins with the context for the research, followed by a discussion of the primary theoretical and modeling commitments. The main theoretical commitment is to develop a language model which is at once functional and cognitively plausible. The paper continues with a description of the word recognition subcomponent of the language model which uses a perceptual span and ACT-Rs spreading activation mechanism to activate and select the lexical unit that most closely matches the perceptual input. Next we present a description of the linguistic structure building component of the model which combines parallel, probabilistic processing with serial, pseudo-deterministic processing, including a non-monotonic context accommodation mechanism. A description of the mapping of linguistic representations into a situation model, follows. The paper concludes with a summary and conclusions.",>Jerry Ball>Mary Freiman>Stuart Rodgers>Christopher Myers,>Air Force Research Laboratory>L3 Communications>AGS Technet>Air Force Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0413/index.html

Computational models of such learning, however, often take the form of corpus analyses and are thus difficult to connect to empirical data. We report a cross-situational learning experiment which demonstrates robust individual differences in learning between infants. We then present a novel generative model of cross-situational learning combining two competing processes  habituation and association. The models parameters are set to best reproduce each infants individual looking behavior from trial-to-trial in training and testing. We then isolate each infants word-referent learning function to explain the variance found in preferential looking tests.",>Daniel Yurovsky>Shohei Hidaka>Chen Yu>Linda Smith,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0414/index.html
2010,Simultaneous Cross-situational Learning of Category and Object Names,"Previous research shows that people can acquire an impressive number of word-referent pairs after viewing a series of ambiguous trials by accumulating co-occurrence statistics (e.g., Yu & Smith, 2007). The present study extends the cross-situational word learning paradigm, which has primarily been used to investigate the acquisition of 1-to-1 word-referent mappings, and shows that humans can concurrently acquire both 1-to-1 and 1-to-many mappings (i.e., a category relation), even when the many referents of a single word have no unifying perceptual features.

However, their syntactic distributions, while overlapping, are not equal in scope (Navarro, 1998). In this paper, we ask whether these distributional differences might be related to semantic differences between the two terms. The preliminary evidence collected here suggests that in and on have slightly different levels of interpretability, even in their prepositional uses. Thus, both semantically and syntactically, the assumption of type-level similarity may need to be qualified.",>Brooke Breaux>Michele Feist,>University of Louisiana at Lafayette>University of Louisiana at Lafayette,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0416/index.html

Results indicate that distributional training on a novel phonetic contrast improves word learning as well as the ability to discriminate a related contrast. We discuss implications for how adults' phonological abilities in affect other aspects of language learning, and also for understanding the effectiveness of different phonetic training regimes.",>Amy Perfors>David Dunbar,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0418/index.html

Exposure to transformational information  that is, information that connects two similar, but perceptually distinct stimuli  was found to have no influence on later judgments of similarity. In Exp. 2, exposure to transformational information was also found not to influence later property generalization; however, exposure to within-category structure that promoted a sense of surprise (i.e., contained clear discontinuity) led to a reduction in later property generalization between two similar, but perceptually distinct stimuli.

One longstanding finding is that peoples belief revision is conser-vative with respect to the normative prescriptions of Bayes Theorem, that is, beliefs are revised less than they should be. In this paper, we consider a novel explanation of conserva-tism, namely that participants do not perceive information provided to them in experiments as coming from a fully reli-able source. From the Bayesian perspective, less reliable evi-dence should lead to more conservative belief revision. Thus, there may be less of discrepancy between normative predic-tions and behavioural data than previously assumed.",>Adam  Corner>Adam  Harris>Ulrike Hahn,>Cardiff University>Warwick University>Cardiff University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0420/index.html

However, free viewing of soccer matches did receive less attention. In an explorative eye-tracking study we compared the viewing behavior of novices, amateur players, and professional players watching soccer scenes freely. Overall, novices seem to view a soccer match quite similar to professional players, whereas amateurs engage in more visual work.

2010,When Robot Gaze Helps Human Listeners: Attentional versus Intentional Account,"Previous research has shown that listeners exploit speaker gaze to objects in a shared scene to ground referring expressions, not only during human-human interaction, but also in human-robot interaction. This paper examines whether the benefits of such referential gaze cues are best explained by an attentional account, where gaze simply serves to direct the listeners visual attention to an object immediately prior to mention, or an intentional account, where speaker gaze is rather interpreted as revealing the referential intentions of the speaker. Two eye-tracking studies within a human-robot interaction setting are presented which suggest that close temporal synchronization of speaker gaze and utterance is not necessary to facilitate comprehension, while the order of gaze cues with respect to order of mentioned references is. We interpret this as evidence in favor of an intentional account.",>Maria Staudte>Matthew W.

In the present study, we further investigate the diagrammatic advantage in low-achieving pre-algebra students and examine whether and how picture algebra instruction improves diagram comprehension and use in the target population. Results replicate the lack of diagrammatic advantage in this population for two types of diagrams. Picture algebra instruction on mapping information in word problems to one type of diagrams yields improvement in both diagrammatic forms, but not story problems without diagrams; a diagrammatic advantage emerges following this instruction. Though low-achieving students may fail to use diagrammatic representations to their benefit when solving word problems, instruction on the use of one specific form may be sufficient to facilitate a more general diagrammatic advantage.",>Julie Booth>Kenneth Koedinger,>Temple University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0424/index.html
2010,Why do four- year- olds show poor cross-modal transfer between haptic and vision?,"Four year olds have difficulty transferring information from the haptic to the visual modality. This difficulty may reflect qualitative differences in haptic and visual object representations or childrens inability to obtain the same kinds of perceptual information in the two modalities. Twenty 4-year-olds explored novel objects either haptically or visually, then haptically chose a match from among three test objects that each matched the exemplar on one perceptual dimension. Children chose shape-based matches after visually exploring category exemplars. However, after haptic exemplar exploration, children were equally likely to pick a shape- or texture-based match. Analysis of childrens hand movements during haptic exploration showed that certain movements reliably predicted shape-based matches. This finding suggests that children have difficulties in cross-modal transfer because their haptic exploration is not driven by a top-down perceptual focus as it is in adults.",>Hilary Kalagher>Susan  Jones,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0425/index.html

2010,Inflectional Suffix Priming in Czech Verbs and Nouns,"Two experiments examined if processing of inflectional affixes is affected by morphological priming, and whether morphological decomposition applies to inflectional morphemes in visual word recognition. Target words with potentially ambiguous suffixes were preceded by primes that contained identical suffixes, homophonous suffixes with different function, or different suffixes. The results partially confirmed the observation that morphological decomposition initially ignores the affix meaning. With verb targets and short stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA), homophonous suffixes had similar effects as identical suffixes. With noun targets, there was a tendency to respond faster after homophonous targets. With longer SOA in verb targets, the primes with identical suffix resulted in shorter responses than the primes with a homophonous suffix. Similar tendency was observed in some noun targets. The results confirm that it is possible to prime inflectional affixes, but that the mechanisms of morphological analysis may operate differently for different types of affixes.",>Filip Smolík,>Institute of Psychology AS CR,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0427/index.html
2010,Restructuring Causal Concepts,"Typical studies of concept learning in adults address the learning of novel concepts, but much of learning involves the updating and restructuring of familiar conceptual domains. Research on conceptual change explores this issue directly but differs greatly from the formal approach of the adult learning studies. This paper bridges these two areas to advance our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying concept restructuring. The main idea behind this approach is that concepts are structured by causal-explanatory knowledge, and hence, models of causal induction may help to clarify the mechanisms of the restructuring process. A new learning paradigm is presented to study the learning and revising of causal networks. Results show that some behaviors indicative of conceptual change arise from basic causal learning mechanisms. Results also support models of causal induction that assume inhibition between competing causes.",>Eric Taylor,">University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0428/index.html
2010,Analysis of the Variability of Three-Dimensional Spatial Relations in Visual Short-Term Memory,"In a laboratory experiment, 13 participants reproduced from memory the position of a sphere relative to a second landmark sphere located on the viewing axis of the observer. The relative location of the second sphere varied both laterally and in depth. The stimuli were generated on a stereoscopic display. The paper focuses on the analysis of the structure of the noise in the reproduced object locations, this structure reflecting the mental representation of the stored spatial relations. The results showed that the spatial location of the landmark sphere affects the variability of the reproduced object locations. In particular, the variability in the frontoparallel plane increases with the length of the depth component of the spatial relation. This finding can be interpreted in two ways. First, spatial acuity in perception decreases, or second, participants encode sensory information by transforming it into a mental spherical coordinate system. Both interpretations are discussed.",>Carsten Winkelholz>Michael  Kleiber>Christopher Marc Schlick,>FKIE>FKIE>RWTH,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0429/index.html
2010,Spatial Factors in Social and Asocial Learning,"Asocial learning is a mechanism by which innovations develop, and social learning is a mechanism by which innovations spread. Penetration of an innovative behavior through a population is measured by the proportion of the population that possesses the innovation. Via agent-based modeling, we examine innovation diffusion with agents learning and interacting in space. Simulations show that innovation spread systematically deviates from differential equations of the proportion of the population that has the innovation. Mediation analysis confirms that boundary surface length of groups having the innovation accounts for these spatial effects. Proportion of asocial innovative learners increases surface length which, in turn, increases social imitative learning.",>Alex Metz>Thomas Shultz,>McGill University>McGill University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0430/index.html
2010,Taking a Look (Literally!) at the Ravens Intelligence Test: Two Visual Solution Strategies,"The Ravens Progressive Matrices intelligence test is widely used as a measure of Spearmans general intelligence factor g. Although Ravens problems resemble geometric analogies, prior computational accounts of solving the test have been propositional. Studies of both typical and atypical human behavior suggest the possible existence of visual strategies; for example, neuroimaging data indicates that individuals with autism may preferentially recruit visual processing brain regions when solving the test. We present two different algorithms that use visual representations to solve Ravens problems. These algorithms yield performances on the Standard Progressive Matrices test at levels equivalent to typically developing 9.5- and 10.5- year-olds. We find that these algorithms perform most strongly on problems identified from factor-analytic human studies as requiring gestalt or visuospatial operations, and less so on problems requiring verbal reasoning. We discuss implications of this work for understanding the computational nature of Ravens and visual analogy in problem solving.

A novel experimental-game paradigm dissociated intended from actual contributions: good intentions could result in bad outcomes and bad intentions in good ones. Participants acted as external judges and attributed responsibility to computer players engaging in a repeated game. On each round, three players formed a group and each chose to roll one of three dice that differed in terms of price and probability distribution. The team won if the sum exceeded a certain threshold. The results showed that both intended contribution, reflected in the choice of die, and actual contribution, reflected in the outcome of rolling the die, were determinants of participants responsibility attributions. However, contrary to previous evidence (Cushman, Dreber, Wang & Costa, 2009), more participants based their attributions on the intention rather than the outcome.",>Tobias Gerstenberg>David A.

2010,Learning perceptual aspects of diagnosis in medicine via eye movement modeling examples on patient video cases,"Complex tasks with a visually rich component, like diagnosing seizures based on patient video cases, not only require the acquisition of conceptual but also of perceptual skills. Medical education has found that besides biomedical knowledge (knowledge of scientific facts) clinical knowledge (actual experience with patients) is crucial. One important aspect of clinical knowledge that medical education has hardly focused on, yet, are perceptual skills, like visually searching, detecting, and interpreting relevant features. Research on instructional design has shown that in a visually rich, but simple classification task perceptual skills could be conveyed by means of showing the eye movements of a didactically behaving expert. The current study applied this method to medical education in a complex task. This was done by example video cases, which were verbally explained by an expert. In addition the experimental groups saw a display of the expert's eye movements recorded, while he performed the task. Results show that blurring non-attended areas of the expert enhances diagnostic performance of epileptic seizures by medical students in contrast to displaying attended areas as a circle and to a control group without attention guidance. These findings show that attention guidance fosters learning of perceptual aspects of clinical knowledge, if implemented in a spotlight manner.",>Halszka Jarodzka>Thomas Balslev>Kenneth Holmqvist>Marcus Nyström>Katharina Scheiter>Peter Gerjets>Berit Eika,">Knowledge Media Research Center>Viborg Hospital, Department of paediatrics>Lund University>Lund University>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center>Aarhus University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0433/index.html
2010,Structure Awareness in Action-Outcome Learning Eradicates the Detrimental Effect of Reinforcement Delays,"Many studies of Action-Outcome Learning have demonstrated that reinforcement delays exert a detrimental influence on learning performance. Different theoretical perspectives offer varying explanations for this effect. A rational perspective suggests that as long as action-outcome pairings can be clearly recognized, delays should not interfere with the inductive process. Here we tested this idea by manipulating whether action-outcome contingencies were clearly identifiable as such by providing structural information in real time. In the absence of such information, we replicated the familiar detrimental effects of delay. Providing structural markers, and thus allowing easy identification of action-outcome pairings, eradicated this effect. Importantly, two additional experiments indicate that these results cannot be attributed to alternative explanations involving outcome salience or better awareness of timing. We conclude that when the environment allows Action-Outcome Learning to be conceptualized as a contingency learning task, learners are capable of covariation computation and immune to variations of response-outcome timing.",>William Greville>Adam Cassar>Mark Johansen>Marc Buehner,>Cardiff University>Cardiff University>Cardiff University>Cardiff University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0434/index.html

We identify two distinct, local choice strategies that both give rise to probability-matching behavior on a global level. Using a dual-task paradigm, we evaluate the hypothesis that these qualitatively different strategies exhibit different demands on individuals' central executive resources. We find that participants placed under a concurrent working memory are driven away from the one-trial-back strategy--utilized by participants without a working memory load--and towards a strategy that integrates a longer window of past outcomes into the current prediction. In other words, the demands of the concurrent task appeared to shift the prediction strategies used by decision-makers in our study.",>A.

We then describe a practical computational framework, which can be used to quantify natural language learnability of a wide variety of linguistic constructions. Finally, we present an experiment which tests the learnability predictions for a variety of linguistic constructions, for which learnability has been much debated.

2010,Learning concepts from sketches via analogical generalization and near-misses,"Modeling how concepts are learned from experience is an important challenge for cognitive science. In cognitive psychology, progressive alignment, i.e., comparing highly similar examples, has been shown to lead to rapid learning. In AI, providing very similar negative examples (near-misses) has been proposed as another way to accelerate learning. This paper describes a model of concept learning that combines these two ideas, using sketched input to automatically encode data and reduce tailorability. SAGE, which models analogical generalization, is used to implement progressive alignment. Near-miss analysis is modeled by using the Structure Mapping Engine to hypothesize classification criteria based on differences. This is performed both on labeled negative examples provided as input, and by using analogical retrieval to find near-miss examples when positive examples are provided. We use a corpus of sketches to show that the model can learn concepts based on sketches and that incorporating near-miss analysis improves learning.",>Matthew D. McLure>Scott E. Friedman>Kenneth D.

Studies examining this phenomenon have relied on empirical data that explicitly show user switch points in the course of multitask performance. This paper addresses a related question: Can these same switch points, found empirically in a multitasking context, be inferred solely from single-task data? We investigate this question and propose an approach that analyzes a particular behavioral signature in single-task data  outliers in the distributions of time between task actions  to infer multitasking breakpoints. We evaluate this approach using behavioral data from a user-interface task, showing how the proposed methods inferences from single-task data match well to the real switch points observed during multitask performance.",>Peter Bogunovich>Dario Salvucci,>Drexel University>Drexel University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0438/index.html
2010,Comparing Human-Human to Human-Computer Tutorial,"Intelligent Tutoring Systems are often modeled after human tutors; however, the effectiveness of this strategy is yet to be determined. Research on media interactions suggests that behaviors with humans are similar to those with computers. Intelligent Tutoring System studies have said the opposite. In this study we compared a human-human and a human-computer tutoring system in terms of metacognitive, social, and nonsense statements to dig deeper into these interactions. We discovered that the interactions were quite different between human-human and human-computer tutoring. With a human, participants expressed more positive metacognitive statements and social statements. When interacting with a computer tutor, students were more likely to make negative metacognitive statements and social statements. In addition, the interpretation of these results differed between the two corpora. In human-human tutoring, the more often a participant made positive metacognitive statements, the worse their learning gain. Their social dialogue had no impact on learning gain. In human-computer tutoring, the more negative and positive metacognitive statements and the more negative social statements they gave the worse their learning gain. It is clear from this study that students do not act the same with a human tutor as they do with a computer tutor. Therefore, designers of ITS systems should not just blindly model their systems after human tutors. The differences in human and computer interactions should also be considered.",>Natalie Steinhauser>Gwendolyn  Campbell>Katherine Harrison>Leanne  Taylor>Myroslava Dzikovska>Johanna Moore,>Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division>Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division>Kaegan Corporation>University of Central Florida>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0439/index.html
2010,Perceptually Grounded Word Meaning Acquisition: A Computational Model,"We present a computational model for the incremental acquisition of word meanings. Inspired by Complementary Learning Systems theory the model comprises different components which are specifically tailored to satisfy the contradictory needs of (1) rapid memorization of word-scene associations and (2) statistical feature extraction to reveal word meanings. Both components are recurrently coupled to achieve a memory consolidation. This process reflects itself in a gradual transfer of the knowledge about a word's meaning into the extracted features. Thereby, the internal representation of a word becomes more efficient and robust. We present simulation results for a visual scene description task in which words describing the relations between objects have been trained. This includes relations in size, color, and position. The results demonstrate our model's capability to acquire word meanings from few training exemplars. We further show that the model correctly extracts word meaning-relevant features and therefore perceptually grounds the words.",>Claudius Gläser>Frank Joublin,>Honda Research Institute Europe>Honda Research Institute Europe,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0440/index.html

Key-stroke logs were collected, and changes in subjective understanding about the topic were measured. The results show that developments of understanding are strongly related to the extent to which writers modify their texts during writing, and this is highest in the conditions expected to promote implicitly guided text production. We conclude that these findings support a dual-process model of writing.",>Veerle Baaijen>David  Galbraith>Kees de Glopper,>University of Groningen>Staffordshire University>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0445/index.html
2010,Number Representations and their Development: A Connectionist Model of Number Comparison,"Building on prior work, the current study evaluated whether connectionist models can account for the distance and size effects in adults and the development of the distance effect in children. A family of models was constructed by orthogonally varying training environment (naturalistic versus non-naturalistic) and number representation (one-to-one versus magnitude). The ability of the models to account for the adult distance and size effects depended critically on a naturalistic training environment but was relatively independent of number representation. With respect to the developmental data, the naturalistic/one-to-one model provided a good account of response times and errors. The relation between the current models and prior models and avenues for future exploration are discussed.",>Mark Lewis>Sashank Varma,>University of Minnesota>University of Minnesota,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0446/index.html

In two experiments, we show that 3- and 4-year-olds both show a stream location effect.

The Relationship between Distributional Format and Subjective Probability Estimates","The elicitation of uncertainty is a topic of interest in a range of disciplines. The conversion of expert beliefs into probability distributions can play a role in assisting key decisions in industry. However, elicitation methods can be prone to bias. In this paper we investigate the effect of changing the presentation of stimulus information and question format on elicited judgments of marginal, conditional and joint probabilities. Participants taught a probability distribution in one structure were expected to have difficulty assessing the distribution in another structure. While this pattern was not found, it turned out that training participants on the more difficult task (learning from a conditional structure) improved overall performance.",>Belinda Bruza>Matthew Welsh>Daniel Navarro>Stephen Begg,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0448/index.html
2010,Of parrots and parsimony: reconsidering Morgan's canon,"Morgans Canon is a specific restating of Occams Razor that dictates that any description of animal behavior should never call upon higher order psychological processes if the behavior could, fairly, be explained in terms of lower processes. Herein, the Canon is discussed both historically and in light of current research into animal behavior. A reconsideration of the principle of parsimony, taking into account current states of knowledge, is also considered. In short, it is argued that Morgans Canon, while a useful guideline, may have been over-enthusiastically applied in situations where the state of knowledge about a species would dictate that descriptions of its behavior in terms of higher order processes would be equally or more parsimonious. The potential benefits of reconsidering the Canon are then discussed.",>Matthew Welsh,>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0449/index.html
2010,Socially induced motor plasticity affects language comprehension,"Language understanding is a socially coordinated activity, but the mechanisms of social coordination in language are poorly understood. Evidence from embodied cognition has shown that movement-induced fatigue of actions slows comprehension of language that refers to those actions. Research on the mirror neuron system suggests that action systems of the brain are also involved in social understanding of actions performed by another, empathy, and possibly language. Here, we show that simultaneous performance and observation of kinematically similar actions produced a fatigue-like effect in sentence judgment times relative to dissimilar control actions. The results suggest that the same action systems used in language processing are influenced by social actions.",>David Havas>Julia  Jenvey>Hayley Shilling>Mitchell Nathan,>UW-Madison>UW-Madison>UW-Madison>UW-Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0450/index.html
2010,Considering the Source: Preschoolers (and Adults) Use Talker Acoustics Predictively and Flexibly in On-Line Sentence Processing,"The identity of the person talking is likely to constrain the things that they talk about. Adults can use talker acoustics to make on-line predictions about upcoming spoken material (Van Berkum et al., 2008). However, this cue to meaning may take time to learn. Do preschoolers consider who is talking when they are comprehending spoken sentences? I explored this question in two eye-tracked picture selection experiments. Experiment 1 showed that children and adults use vocal cues to talker identity in predicting the color of upcoming referents in spoken sentences. Experiment 2 showed that children and adults flexibly use acoustic cues to talker for first-person requests (I want the square) but reference to individuals for third-person requests (Billy wants the square). This suggests that children aged 3-5 years use who is talking to constrain the scope of reference in sentence processing, and know when this cue is likely to be useful.",>Sarah Creel,">University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0451/index.html
2010,Hebbian learning for deciding optimally among many alternatives (almost),"Reward-maximizing performance and neurally plausible mechanisms for achieving it have been completely characterized for a general class of two-alternative decision making tasks, and data suggest that humans can implement the optimal procedure. A greater number of alternatives complicates the analysis, but here too, analytical approximations to optimality that are physically and psychologically plausible have been analyzed. All of these analyses, however, leave critical open questions, two of which are the following: 1) How are near-optimal model parameterizations learned from experience? 2) How can sensory neurons' broad tuning curves be incorporated into the aforementioned optimal performance theory, which assumes decisions are based only on the most informative neurons? We present a possible answer to all of these questions in the form of an extremely simple, reward-modulated Hebbian learning rule for weight updates in a neural network that learns to approximate the multi-hypothesis sequential probability ratio test.",>Patrick Simen>Tyler  McMillen>Sam Behseta,>Princeton University>California State Fullerton>California State Fullerton,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0452/index.html
2010,Contributions of Prosodic and Distributional Features of Caregivers' Speech in Early Word Learning,"How do characteristics of caregiver speech contribute to a child's early word learning? We explore the relationship between a single child's vocabulary growth and the distributional and prosodic characteristics of the speech he hears using data collected for the Human Speechome Project, an ecologically valid corpus collected from the home of a family with a young child. We measured F0, intensity, phoneme duration, usage frequency, recurrence, and MLU for caregivers' production of each word that the child learned during the period of recording. When all variables are considered, we obtain a model of word acquisition as a function of caregiver input speech. Coefficient estimates in the model help to illuminate which factors are relevant to learning classes of words. In addition, words that deviate from the model's prediction are of interest as they may suggest important social, contextual and other cues relevant to word learning.",>Soroush Vosoughi>Brandon Roy>Michael Frank>Deb Roy,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0453/index.html

Participants, age 3.0 to 5.0 years, were asked to make one-shot relational matches from a base to a target display. Two types of questions were posed: Generic in which the base display contained simple geometric shapes and Concrete in which the base display contained colorful familiar objects. Two between-subjects conditions varied the order in which the Concrete and Generic questions were asked. The results reveal relational matching on Concrete questions was significantly higher when preceded by Generic questions than when answered first, suggesting children transferred relational knowledge acquired through the Generic questions to answer the Concrete questions. However, there was no improvement on Generic questions when preceded by Concrete questions. These are novel findings suggesting that young children can better acquire and subsequently transfer relational knowledge from a generic format than from a concrete, perceptually rich format.",>Jennifer Kaminski>Vladimir Sloutsky,>Ohio State University>Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0454/index.html
2010,How does the presence of a label affect attention to other features?,"Are labels cues to category membership or simply highly salient features? This question is difficult to answer definitively because of the challenge in identifying empirical predictions that would be distinct in each case: either way, one would expect labels to be highly interesting, easy to process, and preferentially used as the basis of generalization. Here we suggest that one difference should be in how the label directs (or fails to direct) attention to the other, less-salient features of the object. We perform a categorization experiment with complex objects containing many low-salience features, and find that labels affect attention to the other features in the same way that highly salient features such as color or sounds do (and unlike an explicit cue to category membership). This results in a diminished ability to use the less-salient features of the categories to generalize appropriately.",>Amy Perfors>Daniel Navarro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0455/index.html

Here, we look at the wisdom of the crowds effect in the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem (MSTP). The MSTP is an optimization problem where observers must connect a set of nodes into a network with the shortest path length possible. A method is developed that creates aggregate solutions based only on the nodes connected in individuals‟ solutions, without access to spatial information about the nodes. Across the three problems analyzed, the solutions produced by the aggregation method perform better than even the best individual, leading to a strong wisdom of the crowds effect. We show this effect can be observed even with sample sizes as small as 6 individuals.",>Sheng Kung Yi>Mark Steyvers>Michael Lee>Matthew Dry,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine>University of Adelaide",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0456/index.html

According to one account, words facilitate categorization by highlighting commonalities among labeled objects. Although there is some behavioral evidence consistent with this claim, research remains limited for whether labels can direct infants attention to corresponding visual features. In the current study, adults and infants were presented with 10 different exemplars that were either associated with 10 different labels, the same label, or presented in silence. An eye tracker recorded visual fixations to common and unique features throughout familiarization. Experiments 1 and 2 provide evidence that unique labels can direct infants and adults attention to unique features (compared to a silent condition); however, the effect of hearing the same label associated with different objects was less robust in both age groups.",>Catherine Best>Christopher Robinson>Vladimir  Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0457/index.html

The participants were 93 undergraduate students who were asked to complete a questionnaire which included free writing on the topic of diagrams, and problem solving. Analysis of the statements and ideas that the students wrote revealed four categories through which diagrams may be mentally represented: uses/purposes, exemplars, personal opinions, and structure. Personal opinions responses were found to negatively correlate with views about the usefulness of diagrams, and with experiences and confidence in using diagrams. In contrast, responses about the uses/purposes of diagrams positively correlated with confidence in using diagrams.

In this experiment, students were to estimate their learning rate on each trial, either before the trial, or immediately after.

2010,Learning to Explore the World through its Statistics: Infants Visual Search in the A-not-B task,"In searching for hidden objects, infants younger than 12 months frequently commit A-not-B errors, in which they successfully search for an object in one location (A) and then fail to search for it when it is conspicuously hidden in a new location (B). Why do they fail to make the switch and perseverate at the first location? Although these errors have often been attributed to cognitive and conceptual limitations, we suggest that the answer is far more basic: in order to search successfully, children must first learn to do so. In what follows, we present an error-driven learning account of A-not-B search which suggests that failing to make the switch is an essential part of learning the appropriate searching cues and contextual search strategies. We elaborate the findings of an eye-tracking experiment with 9 month-olds that behaviorally confirms the predictions of our learning model.",>Hanna Popick>Michael Ramscar>Natasha Kirkham,">Stanford University>Stanford University>University of London, Birkbeck",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0460/index.html
2010,The Impact of Collective Opinion on Online Judgment,"Social media are part of our everyday lives. These technologies allow people to share their opinions with others. Here I examine whether the opinions posted online actually change peoples perception of the world or they simply serve as anchors when people post their own opinions. Participants rated the interestingness of given stories. In one condition, the stories were presented with invented average ratings of others that matched the rating task. In another condition, the assumed opinions of others mismatched the rating task. Only in the task match condition, people used the opinions of others when rating the stories. The results suggest that the others opinions are used as anchors when making judgments and do not influence peoples perception as much as one may expect. The current work provides insights into cognitive mechanisms underlying collective behavior in online environments as well as a lesson for users and designers of social media websites.",>Yasuaki Sakamoto,>Stevens Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0461/index.html
2010,Enhancing Acquisition of Intuition versus Planning in Problem Solving,"The acquisition of intuition, which guides problem solving by pruning unpromising strategies, is essential to the development of expertise in any domain. Problem-solving intuition may be viewed as analogous to search heuristics in artificial intelligence. One prediction inspired by this analogy is that practicing on subproblems and relaxed problems (versions of a problem with fewer constraints on the goal state and on the possible moves, respectively) may enhance the development of intuition for the full problem. Using the n-puzzle, we found that practice on relaxed problems did promote intuition compared to practice on the full problem, but impaired performance on solving the full problem. More detailed analyses suggest that practice on relaxed problems may discourage planning and encourage reliance on intuition. Planning is slower but more likely to produce optimal solutions if given enough time, whereas relying on intuition is faster but may lead to suboptimal solutions.",>Dawn Chen>Keith Holyoak,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0462/index.html

To explore the origin of human altruism, we tested whether 16-month-old infants have an expectation of helping behavior when they observe an interaction between others. Infants watched videos in which one (capable) agent had achieved a goal while the other (incapable) one could not. In a subsequent situation, the capable agent either helped the incapable agent achieve the goal (helping event), or ignored the incapable agent and achieved the goal alone (ignoring event). Infants looked longer at the ignoring event, suggesting that they expected helping behavior rather than ignoring behavior.

Sixty-four participants in one control and two experimental groups rated lines of 36 different lengths. Lines appeared on a computer screen and subjects gave their ratings using a standard keyboard. In the experimental groups trials did not change automatically, but subjects had to press a specific button (called the trial change button), which was next to one of the response buttons. It was hypothesized that this manipulation would lead to assimilation of the ratings toward the category whose button was next to the trial change button. The results confirmed this hypothesis.

2010,The Role of Event Knowledge in Comprehending Synesthetic Metaphors,"A synesthetic metaphor (e.g., ""sweet touch"") is a metaphor that results from a combination of a modifier and a head, where they express different perceptual qualities. Most of the existing studies examine how the acceptability of synesthetic metaphors can be explained by the pairing of adjective modifiers and head nouns modalities. However, little attention has been paid to how people comprehend synesthetic metaphors. This paper explores how people comprehend Japanese synesthetic metaphors. In our psychological experiment we collected 10388 words associated with 62 synesthetic metaphors and classified them into the following four kinds of features: common (features listed for the metaphor, the vehicle and the topic), vehicle-shared (features listed for both the metaphor and the vehicle, but not listed for the topic), topic-shared (features listed for both the metaphor and the topic, but not listed for the vehicle), and emergent (features listed for the metaphor, but not listed for either the vehicle or the topic). The result showed that there were significantly more emergent features than the other kinds of features in the comprehension of synesthetic metaphors. This result suggests that we do not so directly comprehend synesthetic metaphors based on salient features of the vehicle or the topic. In this paper we focus on event knowledge which is assumed to play a crucial role in comprehending synesthetic metaphors. We analyzed how many words associated with synesthetic metaphors could be classified into those based on event knowledge. The results showed that there were significantly more words based on event knowledge than those which could not be classified as words based on event knowledge. This result suggests that event knowledge play an important role in comprehending synesthetic metaphors.",>Tetsuaki Nakamura>Maki Sakamoto>Akira Utsumi,>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0466/index.html

People memorized more items if they had touched the stimuli during learning. The experiments differ from many of the classical studies testing embodiment of human memory in two main respects: First, the performed actions are completely unrelated to the essence of the learned stimuli, thus the results can not be explained by pure association-based facilitation. Second, the actions are performed during the encoding phase only, thus the results maybe directly linked to the nature of the encoded representations. The possible mechanisms that may underlie the observed influence are discussed shortly.",>Georgi Petkov>Prolet Nikolova,>New Bulgarian University NBU>New Bulgarian University NBU,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0467/index.html
2010,A Bayesian Antidote Against Strategy Sprawl,"Many theories in cognitive science assume that people possess a repertoire of strategies or a ""toolbox"" from which they choose depending on the situation. This approach suffers from the problem that the number of assumed strategies is often not constrained and may be extended post-hoc to improve the fit to the data. This makes it difficult to rigorously test and compare strategy repertoire models. To prevent this ""strategy sprawl"", a criterion is necessary to decide how many strategies a toolbox should include. Here, Bayesian statistics provide a powerful tool to evaluate toolboxes of different sizes based on their marginal likelihoods. The present work illustrates how such a Bayesian approach can be implemented and demonstrates its applicability by means of parameter recovery studies. Our approach also makes the novel contribution of showing how Bayesian statistics allow testing the strategy repertoire theory against alternative decision theories.",>Benjamin Scheibehenne>Jörg Rieskamp,>University of Basel>University of Basel,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0468/index.html
2010,Meaning Representation in Natural Language Categorization,"A large number of formal models of categorization have been proposed in recent years. Many of these are tested on artificial categories or perceptual stimuli. In this paper we focus on categorization models for natural language concepts and specifically address the question of how these may be represented. Many psychological theories of semantic cognition assume that concepts are defined by features which are commonly elicited from humans. Norming studies yield detailed knowledge about meaning representations, however they are small-scale (features are obtained for a few hundred words), and admittedly of limited use for a general model of natural language categorization. As an alternative we investigate whether category meanings may be represented quantitatively in terms of simple co-occurrence statistics extracted from large text collections. Experimental comparisons of feature-based categorization models against models based on data-driven representations indicate that the latter represent a viable alternative to the feature norms typically used.",>Trevor Fountain>Mirella Lapata,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0469/index.html

On the basis of some of these studies, a hierarchical process model has been proposed, which consist of four hierarchical levels describing different kind of pauses. In this model, the lowest level consists of pauses between strokes within letters. On higher levels, there are pauses between letters, words, and phrases. Each level is associated with a larger amount of processing when retrieving these chunks from memory. The main aim of the present study is to test whether the temporal chunk signal can distinguish a fifth level, the sentence level. A secondary goal is to replicate the findings which were used to construct the hierarchical process model in a manner that overcomes some of the limitations of the earlier experiments.",>Erlijn van Genuchten>P.

In this paper, we focus on two particular aspects of this coordination: linguistic structure and visual attention during sentence production, based on the hypothesis that similar scan patterns are associated with similar sentences. We tested this hypothesis using a dataset from an eye-tracking experiment in which participants had to describe photo-realistic scenes. We paired each sentence produced with the corresponding scan pattern, and computed a range of similarity measures for both modalities. Correlation and mixed model analyses confirmed that trials involving similar scan patterns also involve similar sentences productions. This was true for all pairs of linguistic and scan pattern similarity measures we investigated. The result holds both before and during sentence production, and for within-scene and between-scene analyses.",>Moreno I.

Participants made speeded button presses, moving their hand upward or downward while viewing words with positive or negative valence. Only the color of the words was relevant to the response; on target trials, there was no requirement to read the words or process their meaning. In Experiment 1, upward responses were faster for positive words, and downward for negative words. This effect was extinguished, however, when words were repeated. In Experiment 2, participants performed the same primary task with the addition of distractor trials. Distractors either oriented attention toward the words meaning or toward their color. Congruity effects were increased with orientation to meaning, but eliminated with orientation to color. When people read words with emotional valence, vertical spatio-motor representations are activated highly automatically, but this automaticity is modulated by repetition and by attentional orientation to the words form or meaning.",>Geoffrey Brookshire>Richard Ivry>Daniel Casasanto,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>University of California - Berkeley>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Donders Center for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0473/index.html

Performance on ToM tasks that relied on inhibitory control was contrasted with performance on ToM tasks that did not rely on inhibitory control. In addition, a range of executive function tasks were administered to all participants. It was hypothesized that if Theory of Mind shares resources with the executive process of inhibition, performance on the ToM task would diminish when inhibition demands were high. Results indicated that performance on the ToM task was significantly lower when participants were required to inhibit superficial discrepancies in the Theory of Mind stories. Moreover, performance on the ToM task correlated with the ability to resist non-linguistic interference. These findings challenge the modular views of Theory of Mind, and suggest that Theory of Mind and executive functions may rely on common cognitive resources.",>Lindsey Frederixon Byom>Margarita  Kaushanskaya,>University of Wisconsin-Madison>University of Wisconsin-Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0476/index.html

All three conditions consisted of a perception phase and a mental imagery phase. The imagery phase was similar for all conditions: i.e., participants looked freely at a blank white screen. The perception phase was different for each condition. In the control condition, participants looked freely at a complex picture. In the first experimental condition, they looked at another complex picture but maintained fixation at the center of the picture. In the second experimental condition, they maintained central fixation while listening to a verbal scene description. The results revealed that despite central fixation during the perception phase under the two experimental conditions, participants eye movements were spread out during the imagery phase, reflecting the spatial positions and directions within the picture or scene.

In an empirical study 121 participants estimated numerical values that correspond to 13 verbal probability expressions. Among the estimates are the most typical numerical equivalent and the minimal and maximal values that just correspond to the given linguistic terms. These values serve as foundation for the proposed fuzzy approach. Positions and shapes of the resulting membership functions suggest that the verbal probability expressions are not distributed equidistantly along the probability scale and vary considerably in symmetry, vagueness and overlap.

2010,Selective attention and development of categorization: An eye tracking study,"Some researchers argue that categorization in early development is knowledge-based rather than perceptually based. This approach requires young children to be able to attend to unobservable properties instead of perceptual features, which are usually more salient. However, potential immaturity of selective attention makes this possibility questionable. Current study tested both young children and adults with a match-to-sample task in which perceptual features were in conflict with the matching rule. Both behavioral and eye tracking data were collected. Eye-tracking results suggested that young children (3- and 4-year-olds) could not inhibit attention to the perceptual features, although behaviorally, 4-year-olds could. These findings are discussed with respect to theoretical accounts of category learning in early development.",>Xin Yao>Vladimir Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0480/index.html
2010,Eye-Movements of Dyslexic Children Reading in Regular Orthography: Exploring Word Frequency and Length Effects,"Eye-movements represent a great interest in studying the specificity of the reading difficulties that individuals with developmental dyslexia have. In the present study dyslexic children were pair-matched with control children in a sentence reading task. The children read sentences in Bulgarian  a Cyrillic alphabet language with regular orthography. Target nouns with controlled frequency and length were embedded in the sentences. Eye movements revealed highly significant group differences in the gaze time and the total fixation times, word frequency and word length effects as well as interaction for both frequency and length with the group factor. These results, especially the frequency effect found in the dyslexic children, are discussed in the context of previous studies.",>Evgenia Hristova>Alexander Gerganov>Ekaterina Todorova>Severina Georgieva,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0481/index.html
2010,Mathematical reasoning with higher-order anti-unifcation,"We show how heuristic-driven theory projection (HDTP, a method based on higher-order anti-unification) can be used to model analogical reasoning in mathematics. More precisely, HDTP provides the framework for a model of the inductive analogy-making process involved in establishing the fundamental concepts of arithmetic. This process is a crucial component for being able to generalise from the concrete experiences that humans have due to their embodied and embedded nature. Such generalisations are a cornerstone of the ability to create an abstract domain like arithmetic. In addition to generalisations, HDTP can also transfer concepts from one domain into another, which is, for example, needed to introduce the concept ZERO into arithmetic. The approach presented here is closely related to the theories of Information Flow and Institutions. The latter in particular provides a compelling way to integrate concept blending into the HDTP approach.",>Markus Guhe>Alison Pease>Alan Smaill>Martin Schmidt>Helmar Gust>Kai-Uwe Kühnberger>Ulf Krumnack,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Osnabrück>University of Osnabrück>University of Osnabrück>University of Osnabrück,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0482/index.html
2010,Head and Hand Movements in the Orchestration of Dialogue,"Gaze and head orientation are considered to be the most important non-verbal cues people use to help manage the flow of conversation. However, if there are more than two participants,gaze and head orientation become problematic. People can only look at a single participant at a time. When speakers concurrently engage with more than one participant, they often make use of both head and hand orientation. We show two contrasts with existing findings. Firstly, people do not automatically look where the speaker is looking. Secondly, we demonstrate that hand movements are more important for the interaction than head movements. Specifically, changes in speaker hand orientation prompt quicker and more frequent responses from recipients than changes in head orientation.",>Stuart Battersby>Patrick Healey,>Queen Mary University Of London>Queen Mary University Of London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0483/index.html
2010,Tracking Lexical and Syntactic Alignment in Conversation,"As much empirical work attests, people have a reliable tendency to match their conversational partner's body movements, speech style, and patterns of language use -- amongst other things. A speci c version of this tendency, Structural priming, which occurs when prior exposure to a particular linguistic structure facilitates one's subsequent processing of the same structure, has gained widespread acceptance. Pickering and Garrod (2004) propose that cross-person structural priming is a basic mechanism of conversational coordination -- part of an automatic, resource-free alignment mechanism that is the basis for all successful human interaction. We present evidence to the contrary from two analyses of a corpus of ordinary conversation. The rst suggests that the level of structural (syntactic) matching is no different from chance, and the second that the observed statistical correlation between prime form and target form may be entirely associated with repetition of lexical form.",>Christine Howes>Patrick G T Healey>Matthew Purver,>Queen Mary University of London>Queen Mary University of London>Queen Mary University of London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0484/index.html
2010,Investigating phonotactics using xenolinguistics: A novel word-picture matching paradigm,"All human languages have restrictions on sound sequences, called phonotactic constraints. Knowledge of phonotactic constraints is typically tested using pseudoword rating tasks, e.g., an English speaker might be asked to rate acceptability or wordlikeness of the phonotactically illegal /bnɪk/ and the phonotactically legal /blɪk/. We introduce a new method of testing knowledge of phonotactic constraints. Instead of asking subjects to rate pseudowords, we ask them to assign pseudowords to pictures of novel objects. The set of available pseudowords is larger than the set of pictures and includes both legal and illegal pseudowords. We find legal pseudowords to be less likely to be left unassigned to pictures than illegal pseudowords. Thus, the listeners show knowledge of the phonotactics of English. We suggest that the present method has important advantages over rating tasks: it is a more direct measurement of the influence of phonotactics on the lexicon, and it allows the experimenter to detect influences of sound symbolism and lexical analogy and separate them from the influence of phonotactics.",>Vsevolod Kapatsinski>Lamia Johnston,>University of Oregon>University of Oregon,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0485/index.html
2010,"Computer-based Learning of Neuroanatomy: A Longitudinal Study of Learning, Transfer, and Retention","Using interactive computer-based methods of instruction, this research examined the contribution of whole (3D) anatomical knowledge to learning sectional anatomy. Participants either learned sectional anatomy alone or learned whole anatomy prior to learning sectional anatomy. Sectional anatomy was explored either with perceptually continuous navigation or discretely, as in the use of an anatomical atlas. Learning occurred over repeated cycles of study, test, and feedback, and continued to a high performance criterion. After learning, transfer of knowledge to interpreting biomedical images and long-term retention were tested. Whole anatomy was learned quickly and transferred well to the learning of sectional anatomy: initial accuracy was higher, learning of sectional anatomy was completed more rapidly, and there was less error over the entire course of learning. Knowledge of whole anatomy benefited the long-term retention of sectional anatomy at 2-3 weeks. Learners demonstrated high levels of transfer to the interpretation of biomedical images.",>Julia Chariker>Farah Naaz>John Pani,>University of Louisville>University of Louisville>University of Louisville,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0486/index.html
2010,Introspection and Mindreading as Mental Simulation,We present a sketch of a computational account of the relationship between certain aspects of introspection with aspects of third-person ascription of mental states (mindreading). The theory we propose is developed in large part as a reaction to what we perceive to be a lack of precision in the literature and a lack of experimental techniques to properly inform the debate on the relationship between 1st and 3rd-person ascription. We first discuss the set of phenomenology associated with self-ascriptions and other- ascriptions before briefly mentioning patterns of deficits associated with each. We sketch the very beginnings of a theory of mindreading in both the 1st and 3rd person within a computational cognitive architecture having mental simulation as one of its core operations. The theory we develop provides computationally-grounded explanations that are compatible with both clinical data and the phenomenology of 1st-person attribution.,>Paul Bello>Marcello Guarini,>Office of Naval Research>University of Windsor,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0487/index.html
2010,Illusions of consistency in quantified assertions,"The mental model theory of reasoning postulates that individuals establish the consistency of a set of assertions by constructing a mental model in which all the assertions hold. Mental models represent what is true but not what is false, and this principle of truth predicts that certain assertions should yield systematic errors. We report an experiment in which participants evaluated the consistency of assertions based on quantifiers and sentential connectives, e.g., All of the artists are barbers or else all of the barbers are artists; Some of the artists are not barbers. The results showed that participants judged consistent assertions to be inconsistent, and vice versa, much more often for the predicted assertions than for control problems, which should be unaffected by the failure to represent what is false. These results provide a litmus test for mental models, because no current alternative theories of reasoning predict them.",>Niklas Kunze>Sangeet Khemlani>Max Lotstein>Phil Johnson-Laird,>University of Konstanz>Princeton University>Princeton University>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0488/index.html

2010,The Role of Dynamic Visualizations and Spatial Layout of Static Visualizations for Learning How to Classify Locomotion Patterns,"In two studies the effectiveness of dynamic and multiple static visualizations was investigated for a highly perceptual learning task, namely locomotion pattern classification. In Study 1a, seventy-five students viewed either dynamic, static-sequential, or static-simultaneous visualizations. For tasks with intermediate difficulty dynamic visualizations led to better recognition of the locomotion patterns than static-sequential visualizations, but not than static-simultaneous visualizations. To test whether the presentation of the static-simultaneous visualizations in rows or their permanent visibility was accountable for this effect, three additional static-simultaneous conditions were investigated in Study 1b. Seventy-five students viewed the static-simultaneous visualizations either presented in columns, in matrices, or in circles. The dynamic condition outperformed all three additionally investigated static-simultaneous conditions in the intermediate tasks. Accordingly, for learning how to classify locomotion patterns dynamic visualizations are better suited than most static presentation formats. Nevertheless, presenting static-simultaneous visualizations appropriately can achieve equal results at least for tasks with intermediate difficulty.",>Birgit Imhof>Katharina Scheiter>Peter Gerjets>Jörg Edelmann,>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center>University of Tuebingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0490/index.html
2010,Working Memory Constraints on Multiple Center-Embedding,"Gibsons (1998) theory on the locality of syntactic dependencies claims that multiply center-embedded clauses are unacceptable if they contain a parse-state with at least two long unresolved predicted categories in addition to the toplevel verb. Long unresolved means a syntactic prediction spanning at least three intervening new discourse referents. This claim was based on experimental analysis of invented examples. Karlsson (2007b) provided corpus data demonstrating that, contrary to widely accepted views in linguistics and cognitive science, there are well-defined constraints on how many (maximally three) and what types of multiple center-embeddings occur in spoken and written discourse in natural languages. Gibsons theory of the processing of multiple center-embeddings will be evaluated in the light of Karlssons empirical data. The corpus data do not support the idea of a discrete limit on working memory capacity, because almost one third of the extant examples of multiple center-embedding are more complex than Gibsons acceptability limit stipulates. Spoken language processing complexity is clearly below Gibsons limit, written language is capable of transgressing it.",>Fred Karlsson,>University of Helsinki,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0491/index.html

Analyses of the occurrence of addressees' acknowledgments and exemplifications of understanding showed that nonverbal forms consistently coincided with the speakers' gaze on their face. In contrast, there was less consistent correspondence between the addressees' verbal evidence of understanding and the speakers' gaze on their face. Evidence that speakers gaze off addressees' faces because of the demands of utterance planning or encoding comes from a correspondence between their gaze off the addressee's face and their production of pause fillers (uh and um), especially at the beginning of clauses.",>Kathleen Eberhard>Hannele Nicholson,>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0492/index.html

2010,Novel Words in Novel Contexts: The Role of Distributional Information in Form-class Category Learning,"One major aspect of successful language acquisition is the ability to organize words into form class categories and generalize from properties of experienced items to novel items. Furthermore, learners must often determine how to use a new word, when there is very sparse information regarding its acceptable contexts. In this work we employ an artificial language learning paradigm to explore how adult learners, under circumstances of varying distributional cues to category boundaries, apply their knowledge of category properties to a new word. We find that in cases of strong category cues and strong category learning, adults readily generalize all of the distributional properties of the learned category to a word that shares just one context with the other category members. However, as the distributional cues regarding the target category become sparser and contain more systematic gaps, learners show more conservatism in generalizing the allowable distributional properties to the novel word. Taken together, these results show striking flexibility in learners tendency to generalize, depending on the distributional properties of the input corpus, in a probabilistically rational way.",>Patricia Reeder>Elissa Newport>Richard Aslin,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0494/index.html
2010,Optimal Language Learning: The Importance of Starting Representative,"Child-directed speech has a distinctive structure and may have facilitatory effects on childrens language learning. We con- sider these facilitatory effects from the perspective of Marrs levels of analysis: could they arise at the computational level or must they be located at at the algorithmic or implementation levels? To determine if the effects could be due to computa- tional level benefits, we examine the question of what samples from a language should best facilitate learning by identifying the optimal linguistic input for an ideal Bayesian learner. Our analysis leads to a mathematical definition of the represen- tativeness of linguistic data, which can be computed for any probabilistic model of language learning. We use this measure to re-examine the debate over whether language learning can be improved by starting small (i.e. learning from data that have limited complexity). We compare the representativeness of corpora with differing levels of complexity, showing that while optimal corpora for a complex language are also com- plex, it is possible to construct relatively good corpora with limited complexity. We discuss the implications of these re- sults for the level of analysis at which a benefit of starting small must be located.",>Anna Rafferty>Thomas Griffiths,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0495/index.html

Negative priming effect has been shown mainly using masked priming but some recent studies have shown it without masks (i.e., in unmasked or conscious conditions). We employed our previous model of masked priming for the unmasked condition here, only by removing mask presentation.

2010,The role of action in perceiving and comparing functional relations,There is growing evidence that even the most abstract capacities of human cognition are not entirely amodal and disembodied. The present study presents two empirical studies which aim to demonstrate that relational reasoning is grounded in our sensory-motor experience. Experiment 1 shows that the affordances of tool-like objects have an effect on comparing functional relations. Experiment 2 makes sure that this finding can not be explained by an automatic activation of motor systems. The results are interpreted as evidence that at least certain functional relations are perceived by simulating interactions with the environment. It is also asserted that the process of comparing such relations is constrained by the properties of the human body such as hand-dominance.,>Ivan Vankov>Boicho Kokinov,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0497/index.html
2010,How Causal Reasoning Can Bias Empirical Evidence,"Theories of causal reasoning and learning often implicitly assume that the structural implications of causal models and empirical evidence are consistent. However, for probabilistic causal relations this may not be the case. We propose a causal consistency hypothesis claiming that people tend to create consistency between the two types of knowledge. Mismatches between structural implications and empirical evidence may lead to distortions of empirical evidence. In the present research we used trial-by-trial learning tasks to study how people attempt to create consistency between structural assumptions and learning data. In Experiment 1 we show biasing of empirical evidence with causal chains even after repeated testing of direct and indirect relations. Experiment 2 investigates whether different causal models lead to different judgments, despite identical data patterns. Overall, the findings support the idea that people try to reconcile assumptions about causal structure with probabilistic data, but also suggest that this may depend on the type of causal structure under consideration.",>Momme von Sydow>York Hagmayer>Björn Meder>Michael R.

2010,Motor Affordances in Object Perception,"Recently, researchers have suggested that when we see an object we automatically represent how that object affords action (Tucker & Ellis, 2001). However, the precise nature of this representation remains unclear: is it a specific motor plan or a more abstract response code? Furthermore, do action representations actually influence what we perceive? In Experiment 1, participants responded to an image of an object and then made a laterality judgment about an image of a hand. Hand identification was fastest when the hand corresponded to both the orientation and grasp type of the object, suggesting that affordances are represented as specific action plans. In Experiment 2, participants saw an image of a hand before interpreting an ambiguous object drawing. Responses were biased towards the interpretation that was congruent with the grasp type of the hand prime. Together, these results suggest that action representations play a critical role in object perception.",>Stephen Flusberg>Alexia Toskos Dils>Lera  Boroditsky,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0501/index.html

In the present article we focus on a factor that attracted surprisingly little attention so far, namely the temporal order in which moral scenarios are presented. We argue that previous research points to a systematic pattern of order effects that has been overlooked until now: Only judgments of actions that are normally regarded as morally acceptable are affected by the order of presentation. Additionally, this is only the case for dilemmas immediately preceded by a scenario where the proposed action was judged as morally unacceptable. We conducted an experiment that confirmed this pattern and allowed us to analyze the individual level responses it was generated by. We argue that investigating order effects is necessary for approaching a complete descriptive moral theory.",>Alex Wiegmann>Yas Okan>Jonas Nagel>Stefan Mangold,>University of Göttingen>University of Granada>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0502/index.html

A final test was given after a 10 minute or 48 hour retention interval. Performance after the 48 hour retention interval was best in the 5-8-13 condition.

Additionally, the strategy used on a task may have a substantial effect on performance. However, little is known about whether and how circadian rhythms and strategy interact to affect performance. The current study investigates participants performance on an orientation task performed over a period of two weeks. Participants were assigned to simulated day or night shift conditions, and were trained to use one of two strategies for the orientation task. The results indicated that shift condition had little impact on a more declarative strategy for the task, but had a significant impact on a more spatial strategy. The results illustrate how different aspects of cognitive functioning may be affected differently by circadian rhythms, and point to some important implications for training and task performance in real-world contexts.",>Tim Halverson>Glenn Gunzelmann>L.

Still preliminary in nature, our data suggests that semantic complexity is much harder to deal with than syntactic one, and that full-scale textual context is negligible for annotation, with the exception of semantic high-complexity cases.

The other three models incorporated some mechanisms of imitation. In the second model, each agent imitated the best solution of a random other. In the third model, each agent followed preferential attachment and imitated the best solution of the agent that was asked by many agents. In the fourth model, each agent developed a familiarity with an agent based on how often it asked a certain agent, and imitated this agent. In two simulation studies, following the most popular or the most familiar agent resulted in a good compromise between efficiency and diversity in finding good solutions. Peoples desire to follow particular individuals may be a key to their adaptive behavior, allowing them to disseminate ideas efficiently while encouraging the exploration of new ideas.",>Yasuaki Sakamoto>Hongyuan Shi,>Stevens Institute of Technology>Stevens Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0510/index.html
2010,Arithmetic Notation now in 3D!,"When people reason formally, they often make use of special notationsalgebra and arithmetic are familiar examples. These notations are often treated as mere shorthanda concise way of referring to meaningful mathematical concepts. Other authors have argued that people treat notations as picturesliteral diagrams of an imagined set of objects (Dörfler, 2003; Landy & Goldstone, 2009). If notations depict objects that exist in space, then it makes sense to wonder how they are arranged not just in the two visible dimensions, but in depth. In four experiments, we find a consistent pattern: properties that increase mathematical precedence also tend to make objects appear closer in space. This alignment of formal pressures and informal pressures suggests that perceived depth may play a role in supporting computational reasoning processes. Although our primary focus is documenting the existence of depth illusions in notations, we also evaluate several sources of information that might guide depth judgments: availability of an object for computational actions, formal syntactic structure, relative symbol salience and voluntary attention shifts. We consider relationships between these nonexclusive possible sources of information in guiding how people judge depth in mathematics.",>David Landy>Sally Linkenauger,>University of Richmond>University of Virginia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0511/index.html

Considered texts describe the same event, but each text may focus on different parts of the event. The considered texts are not paraphrases, but rather human- produced descriptions of a simple picture. The goal is not to find similar words in texts, which can be easily done, but to meaningfully connect the overlapping concepts and relationships used in the text descriptions. The meaning-based approach does not use any statistical/machine-learning techniques. The performance of a machine in finding similarity is compared to human performance not just in numbers but in the found information. The results show that the machine matches four out of the five human findings.",>Julia Taylor,>Riverglass Inc,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0512/index.html

2010,Prior expectations in pedagogical situations,"Much of human learning occurs in social situations, and among these, pedagogical situations may afford the most powerful learning. In pedagogical situations, a teacher chooses the concept that they are going to teach and the examples that they use to teach the concept. If learners know that a teacher is helpful and understands the implications, this could support strong inferences. In previous work, Shafto & Goodman (2008) proposed and tested a model of pedagogical data selection. We integrate special-purpose pedagogical expectations in this framework, and derive a task that allows independent assessment of pedagogical expectations. Two experiments contrast people's expectations about pedagogical and communicative situations. The results show that people's expectations differ in these situations, and that in pedagogical situations people expect teachers to present generalizable and semantically coherent knowledge.

2010,A Spiking Neuron Model of Serial-Order Recall,"Vector symbolic architectures (VSAs) have been used to model the human serial-order memory system for decades. Despite their success, however, none of these models have yet been shown to work in a spiking neuron network. In an effort to take the first step, we present a proof-of-concept VSA-based model of serial-order memory implemented in a network of spiking neurons and demonstrate its ability to successfully encode and decode item sequences. This model also provides some insight into the differences between the cognitive processes of memory encoding and subsequent recall, and establish a firm foundation on which more complex VSA-based models of memory can be developed.",>Feng-Xuan Choo>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0515/index.html
2010,Nonverbal Semantic Processing Disrupts Visual Word Recognition in Healthy Adults,"Two experiments examined the effect of semantic interference on visual lexical decision (vLD) in normal skilled readers. Experiment 1 employed a dual-task paradigm to test whether nonverbal semantic processing disrupts visual word recognition when the orthographic structure of words and non-words is controlled. Experiment 2 employed the same paradigm to test whether participants strategically shifted their reliance onto orthographic information when orthographic structure provided a cue to lexicality. The results showed (1) significant semantic interference in the vLD task in normal skilled readers when words and non-words were matched for orthographic well-formedness and (2) no semantic interference when words and non-words differed reliably in their orthographic well-formedness. The results are consistent with the view that accurate lexical decisions depend upon semantic activation, especially when judgments cannot be made on the basis of orthographic structure alone.

2010,Effects of Anticipatory Coarticulation on Lexical Access,"One of the most challenging unsolved problems in cognitive science is lack of invariance in spoken language. We take the view that variability due to coarticulation is systematic and beneficial. Several recent eye tracking experiments have demonstrated listeners' sensitivity to local coarticulatory cues between adjacent phonemes. We examined sensitivity to longer-range, anticipatory vowel-to-vowel coarticulation, which can spread across multiple syllables. Using a variant of the Visual World eye tracking paradigm (Tanenhaus et al., 1995), we conducted the first on-line test of whether lexical access is sensitive to such subtle, long-range cues, and whether the impact of such cues is modulated by the coarticulation resistance of intervening segments. Lexical access was delayed when misleading anticipatory coarticulation was available in cross-spliced materials. This significantly extends the nature and temporal range of subcategorical cues known to influence on-line sentence comprehension, and demonstrates that lexical access is simultaneously constrained by information at multiple temporal grains.",>Stephen Tobin>Pyeong Whan Cho>Patrick Jennet>James Magnuson,">University of Connecticut, Haskins Laboratories>University of Connecticut, Haskins Laboratories>University of Connecticut>University of Connecticut, Haskins Laboratories",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0517/index.html
2010,Cross Cultural Differences in Implicit Learning,"Previous studies have indicated cross cultural differences in conscious processes such that Easterners have a preference for a more global perspective and Westerners for a more analytical perspective. We investigated whether these biases also apply to implicit learning. In Experiment 1, Japanese and British participants were asked to attend to one of the two aspects of a set of GLOCAL strings, global or local. The results showed that they could learn the AG implicitly only from the attended level in both cultural groups. They also showed that the global superiority in implicit learning was found only for the Japanese. In Experiment 2, these cultural differences were examined without manipulating the participants attention. The results indicated implicit learning only at the global and not the local level for the Japanese, but equal learning of both levels by the British. We concluded that cultural biases strongly affect the type of unconscious knowledge that people acquire.",>Sachiko Kiyokawa>Zoltán Dienes>Daisuke Tanaka>Ayumi Yamada,>Chubu University>University of Sussex>Tottori University>Aoyama Gakuin Univesity,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0518/index.html
2010,Interaction between lexical and syntactic structures in transcoding from verbal to Arabic numerals,"We explore the relationship between the lexical structure and the syntactical structure of numerical expressions in number transcoding from the oral verbal format to the Arabic digital format. The experimental setup included asking six to eight-year old Spanish-speaking children attending elementary school to write in Arabic format a set of dictated numerals. The method of analysis includes the construction of a relational representation of children's production and the use of clustering techniques to identify patterns. The model relates children and dictated numerals by children's accomplishment and generates a subsidiary similitude relation between dictated numerals with patterns that show differentiated structures. We find that the presence or absence of a verbal expression for the Hundred position digit in the dictated numeral marks one of the structures. The second structure comes from the role of two digit numbers (e.g. 20 or 34): homogeneous in the Decade position and heterogeneous in the Thousand position. We interpret these results as consistent with the semantic-lexical internal number representation model by R.J.D. Power and M.F.

Heathcote, Brown & Prince (submitted) recently proposed a Bayes Factor method for estimating the evidence favoring one or more than one latent variable in a state-trace experiment, known as Bayesian Ordinal Analysis of State-Traces (BOAST). We report results from a series of simulations indicating that for larger sample sizes BOAST performs well in identifying dimensionality for single and multiple latent variable models.

Performance on this task has also been shown to be associated with common genetic variants in FOXP2. To investigate what these differences can tell us about the functional properties of language processing, we present a computational model of the SRT task.

However, when Loftus, Oberg and Dillon (2004; also Prince and Heathcote, 2009) examined the DFIE using state-trace analysis (Bamber, 1979) they found evidence for a one-dimensional encoding of unfamiliar faces when inversion only occurred during the study phase of a recognition memory task.

A latent variable approach was taken to examine the relationships among these cognitive measures. Decomposing the externally cued task switching costs into a cue switch component and a task switch component indicated that individual differences in these costs could be explained by benefits of repeated cues rather than by changes in tasks. Individual differences in the cue switch component were predicted by long-term memory scores.",>Christina Wasylyshyn,>Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0526/index.html
2010,Deconfounding Hypothesis Generation and Evaluation in Bayesian Models,"Bayesian models of cognition are typically used to describe human learning and inference at the computational level, identifying which hypotheses people should select to explain observed data given a particular set of inductive biases. However, such an analysis can be consistent with human behavior even if people are not actually carrying out exact Bayesian inference. We analyze a simple algorithm by which people might be approximating Bayesian inference, in which a limited set of hypotheses are generated and then evaluated using Bayes' rule. Our mathematical results indicate that a purely computational-level analysis of learners using this algorithm would confound the distinct processes of hypothesis generation and hypothesis evaluation. We use a causal learning experiment to establish empirically that the processes of generation and evaluation can be distinguished in human learners, demonstrating the importance of recognizing this distinction when interpreting Bayesian models.",>Elizabeth Baraff Bonawitz>Thomas L.

2010,Finding a Bigger Fish Bowl: Higher Difficulty Helps Transitive Inferences,"The current study looks at preschoolers ability to discover higher-order patterns spontaneously, without being explicitly taught to do so. The higher-order pattern of interest was the degree of transitivity among the relations of three arbitrary dimensions. Preschoolers and adults were taught two relations (i.e., A = B; B = C), and they were asked to guess the third relation (i.e., between A and C). In each case, a relation was a perfect correlation between two arbitrary relations (e.g., heavy = large). The crucial manipulation pertained to how difficult it was to learn the two relations. The two relations either matched in direction (which was conceived as low learning difficulty), or they had opposite directions (which was conceived as high learning difficulty). Our prediction was that the higher-order pattern of transitivity becomes apparent when learning difficulty is high. The argument is that a local mismatch makes it difficult for children to focus merely on the isolated relations, and thus sets the stage for higher-order insights. Results confirm our hypothesis, both for preschoolers and adults. Participants were more likely to engage in higher-order transitive reasoning in the case of a local mismatch between the to-be-learned relations than in the case of a local match.",>Sarah Schwind>Heidi Kloos,>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0528/index.html
2010,Preschoolers sample from probability distributions,"Researchers in both educational and developmental psychology have suggested that children are not particularly adept hypothesis testers, and that their behavior can often appear irrational. However, a growing body of research also suggests that people do engage in rational inference on a variety of tasks. Recently researchers have begun testing the idea that reasoners may be sampling hypotheses from an internal probability distribution when making inferences. If children are reasoning in this way, this might help to explain some seemingly irrational behavior seen in previous experiments. Forty 4-year-olds were tested on a probabilistic inference task that required them to make repeated guesses about which of two types of blocks had been randomly sampled from a population. Results suggest that children can sample from a probability distribution as evidenced by the fact that, as a group, they engaged in probability matching and that the dependency between successive guesses decreased over time.",>Stephanie Denison>Elizabeth Baraff Bonawitz>Alison Gopnik>Thomas L.

2010,Topical Relevance and Information Quality in Cognitive Models of Web Search Behavior: Introducing Epistemic Scent into Information Foraging Theory,"Current cognitive models of Web navigation (e.g., Information Foraging Theory, IFT, Pirolli, 2007) are based on the assumption that users behavior is guided by evaluating the topical relevance of information encountered on the Web. This information scent has been successfully used to model Web search behavior. In this paper, however, we claim that topicality-oriented theories like IFT need to additionally consider the evaluation of information quality in order to address a broader class of realistic search tasks. For instance, when search tasks are complex and the quality of available Web information is highly variable, Web navigation will also depend on evaluating information quality, in addition to evaluating topical relevance. In this paper we first provide a theoretical framework of quality evaluation during Web search. Second, we review two experimental studies to substantiate this theoretical framework. Finally, we propose an extension of IFT using the concept of epistemic scent to incorporate evaluations of quality into the theory.",>Peter Gerjets>Yvonne Kammerer,">Knowledge Media Research Center Tuebingen, Germany>Knowledge Media Research Center Tuebingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0530/index.html

These objects are richly structured, defined in terms of systems of relations, subparts, and recursive embeddings. We describe an approach to concept representation and learning that attempts to capture such structured objects. This approach builds on recent probabilistic approaches, viewing concepts as generative processes, and on recent rule-based approaches, constructing concepts inductively from a language of thought. Concepts are modeled as probabilistic programs that describe generative processes; these programs are described in a compositional language. In an exploratory concept learning experiment, we investigate human learning from sets of tree-like objects generated by processes that vary in their abstract structure, from simple prototypes to complex recursions. We compare human categorization judgements to predictions of the true generative process as well as a variety of exemplar-based heuristics.",>Andreas Stuhlmüller>Joshua B. Tenenbaum>Noah D.

Prime presentation duration was manipulated and, within both eye movement conditions, it was found that short primes produced a preference to choose a primed alternative, whereas for longer duration primes this preference was absent. Based on the similarity between eye movement conditions, it is argued that prime and target features from separate fixations are still confusable and that evidence regarding prime feature must still be discounted. A computation model that includes these offsetting components of source confusion and discounting provides an excellent account of our results.",>Stephen Denton>Richard M.

2010,Toward a Large-Scale Characterization of the Learning Chain Reaction,"Designing an agent that can grow cognitively from a child to an adult human level of intelligence is the key challenge on the roadmap to human-level artificial intelligence. To solve this challenge, it is important to understand general characteristics of the expected learning process at a level of mathematical models. The present work makes a step toward this goal with a simple abstract model of a long-term learning process. Results indicate that this process of learning is characterized by two distinct regimes: (1) limited learning and (2) global learning chain reaction. The transition is determined by the set of initially available learning skills and techniques. Therefore, the notion of a critical mass for a human-level learner makes sense and can be determined experimentally.",>Alexei Samsonovich,>George Mason University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0535/index.html

Both simple and complex tasks were presented. Pairs in the audio condition outperformed those in the text and video condition overall, and specifically on complex tasks, despite the fact that the video condition allows for the greatest amount of information to be communicated. Analysis of conversations between pairs indicates that those in the video condition had different conversational behavior.

We report two experiments designed to help understand this heterogeneity. In both, participants performed a two-category classification task with novel stimuli varying along two psychologically separable dimensions. In semi-supervised conditions, participants categorized and received feedback on 32 labeled items intermixed with a large number of unlabeled items. In the supervised-only condition, participants viewed the same labeled trials intermixed with a large number of filler trials. Without time pressure participants learned the task equally well in both conditions. When required to respond very rapidly, however, participants performed substantially better in the semi-supervised condition.

2010,Embodiment and Virtual Reality in Learning to Visualize Anatomy,"This study examines the facilitative effects of embodiment of a complex internal anatomical structure through three-dimensional (3-D) interactivity in a virtual reality (VR) program. Since Shepard and Metzlers influential 1971 study, it has been known that 3-D objects (e.g., multiple-armed cube or external body parts) are visually and motorically embodied in our minds. Such findings confirm the theory that our mental images, and rotations of these images, are in fact confined by the laws of physics and biomechanics, because we perceive, think and reason in an embodied fashion. With the advancement of new technologies, virtual reality programs for medical education now enable users to interact directly in a 3-D environment with internal anatomical structures. Given that such structures are not readily viewable to users and thus not previously susceptible to embodiment, coupled with the VR environment affording all possible degrees of rotation, how people learn from these programs raises new questions. If we embody external anatomical parts we can see, such as our hands and feet, can we embody internal anatomical parts we cannot see? Does manipulating the anatomical part in virtual space facilitate the users embodiment of that structure and therefore the ability to visualize the structure mentally? Medical students grouped in yoked-pairs were tasked with mastering the spatial configuration of an internal anatomical structure; only one group was allowed to manipulate the images of this anatomical structure in a 3-D VR environment, whereas the other group could only view the manipulation. The manipulation group outperformed the visual group, suggesting that the interactivity that took place among the manipulation group promoted visual and motoric embodiment, which in turn enhanced learning. Moreover, when accounting for spatial ability, it was found that manipulation benefits students with low spatial ability more than students with high spatial ability.",>Susan Jang>John Black>Robert Jyung,">Teachers College, Columbia University>Teachers College, Columbia University>University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0538/index.html
2010,Predicting Students' Retention of Facts from Feedback during Study,"Testing students as they study a set of facts is known to enhance their learning (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). Testing also provides tutoring software with potentially valuable information regarding the extent to which a student has mastered study material. This information, consisting of recall accuracies and response latencies, can in principle be used by tutoring software to provide students with individualized instruction by allocating a student's time to the facts whose further study it predicts would provide greatest benefit. In this paper, we propose and evaluate several algorithms that tackle the benefit-prediction aspect of this goal. Each algorithm is tasked with calculating the likelihood a student will recall facts in the future given recall accuracy and response latencies observed in the past. The disparate algorithms we tried, which range from logistic regression to a Bayesian extension of the ACT-R declarative memory module, proved to all be roughly equivalent in their predictive power. Our modeling work demonstrates that, although response latency is predictive of future test performance, it yields no predictive power beyond that which is held in response accuracy.",>Robert Lindsey>Owen Lewis>Harold Pashler>Michael Mozer,">University of Colorado, Boulder>University of Colorado, Boulder>University of California, San Diego>University of Colorado, Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0539/index.html
2010,Differences in the Development of Analogy Across Cultures: A Computational Account,"Theories of the development of analogical reasoning emphasize either the centrality of relational knowledge accretion or changes in information processing. Recent cross-cultural data collected from children in the United States and China (Richland, Chan, Morrison, & Au, 2010) provides a unique way to test these theories. Here we use simulations in LISA/DORA (Doumas, Hummel, & Sandhofer, 2008; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997, 2003), a neurally-plausible computer model of relational learning and analogical reasoning, to argue that the development of analogical reasoning in children may best be conceptualized as an equilibrium between knowledge accretion and progressive improvement in information processing capability. Thus, improvements in inhibitory control in working memory as children mature enable them to process more relationally complex analogies. At the same time, however, children produce more complex and more accurate analogies in domains in which they have learned richer and more refined representations of relational concepts.",>Leonidas Doumas>Robert Morrison>Lindsey Richland,">University of Hawaii>Loyala University, Chicago>UC, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0540/index.html

2010,Recognizability of Individual Creative Style Within and Across Domains: Preliminary Studies,"It is hypothesized that creativity arises from the self-mending capacity of an internal model of the world, or worldview. The uniquely honed worldview of a creative individual results in a distinctive style that is recognizable within and across domains. It is further hypothesized that creativity is domain-general in the sense that there exist multiple avenues by which the distinctiveness of ones worldview can be expressed. These hypotheses were tested using art students and creative writing students. Art students guessed significantly above chance both which painting was done by which of five famous artists, and which artwork was done by which of their peers. Similarly, creative writing students guessed significantly above chance both which passage was written by which of five famous writers, and which passage was written by which of their peers. These findings support the hypothesis that creative style is recognizable. Moreover, creative writing students guessed significantly above chance which of their peers produced particular works of art, supporting the hypothesis that creative style is recognizable not just within but across domains.",>Liane Gabora,>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0542/index.html

2010,Cross-Situational Statistical Learning: Implicit or Intentional?,"For decades, implicit learning researchers have examined a variety of cognitive tasks in which humans seem to automatically extract structure from the environment. Similarly, statistical learning studies have shown that humans can use repeated co-occurrence of words and referents to build lexicons from individually ambiguous experiences (Yu & Smith, 2007). In light of this, the goal of the present paper is to investigate whether adult cross-situational learners require an explicit effort to learn word-object mappings, or if it may take place incidentally, requiring merely attention to the audiovisual stimuli. In two implicit learning experiments with incidental tasks that direct participants attention to different aspects of the stimuli, we found evidence of learning, suggesting that cross-situational learning mechanisms can be incidental without explicit intention. However, learning was superior under explicit study instructions, indicating that strategic inference may also play a role.",>George Kachergis>Chen Yu>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0544/index.html

2010,On the limits of dynamic imagination: A mental extrapolation task,"To mentally extrapolate the trajectory of a moving object which disappears from sight, it is possible to exploit two different sources of information. One source is the memory of the last visible movement of the object, and the other is its inferred movement through time. It is often assumed that these cues are integrated into dynamical analog mental representations. To investigate the nature of the mental representation of imagined movements, we used a new experimental paradigm for which a causality attribution task was combined with motion prediction task. Participants were instructed to imagine the trajectory of a moving object disappearing behind a screen while estimating the degree to which the movement was caused by another moving object. We show that the predicted movement departs from a correct extrapolation based on accurate memory for velocity.

The items encountered in the domain were complex in that there were multiple sources of information that might be used to organize conceptual knowledge related to the domain. I test the hypothesis that goal-directed interactions will constrain the acquisition of knowledge such that functional categories of the items, organized around goal-relevant features, are learned. Converging evidence from two measures provided strong support for the idea that participants organized their knowledge of the domain in terms of goal-relevant features, and the conceptual organization was able to support both the completion of the task and subsequent categorization tasks.",>Seth Chin-Parker,>Denison University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0547/index.html
2010,Different Kinds of Pragmatic Factors Explain Failures of Default-to-Stereotype Inferences,"Connolly, Fodor, Gleitman, and Gleitman (2007) present theoretical and empirical evidence against the Default-to-Stereotype (in short: DS) inference and argue that prototype theories of concepts predict (DS)-inferences. Hence, they conclude that prototype theories are inadequate. Jönsson and Hampton (2008) and Hampton, Jönsson, and Passanisi (2009) argue that (1) prototype theories do in general not predict (DS)-inferences, and that (2) Gricean pragmatic effects can largely account for Connolly et al.'s empirical results. They, however, interpret a minor but still substantial part of the findings as a genuine deviation from the (DS)-inference rule. In this paper we first argue that the results of Connolly et al. (2007) pose a greater threat to prototype theories of concepts than Jönsson and Hampton (2008) suggest. Second, we present an experiment which implies that Connolly et al.'s findings can be solely explained by following Gricean pragmatic factors: (a) non-redundancy preferences and (b) informativeness suppositions.",>Matthias Unterhuber>Gerhard Schurz,>University of Düsseldorf>University of Düsseldorf,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0548/index.html
2010,The Effect of Graph Design Type on Word Preferences In the Description of Trend and Cyclic Events,"This study was conducted as a part of larger study on the effect of graph type on trend and cyclic event comprehension. It aims to present the analysis of subjects word preferences in the verbal description of trend and cyclic events, given different graph types (linear, round). For this purpose, a novel round graph type was designed. For instance, while in the linear graph timeline for a year, January is located on the left and December on the right side, in the round graph, January and December are located adjacently. As a data collection tool, verbal description task and evaluation forms were used. 40 university students participated in this study. The results revealed that, although the graph type has no significant effect, the event type conveyed by them modulates word preferences (ex. usage of trend, discrete, and conceptual words) in the description of relations among elements depicted in the graph.",>Ozge Alacam>Annette Hohenberger>Kursat Cagiltay,>Middle East Technical University>Middle East Technical University>Middle East Technical University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0549/index.html
2010,When to Switch? Understanding How Performance Tradeoffs Shape Dual-Task Strategy,We use a novel dual-task paradigm to investigate how people adapt their strategy for interleaving attention between tasks to meet varying performance objectives. The study required participants to encode and enter a series of route instructions from a secondary display while driving a simulated vehicle. Experimental instructions were given to encourage participants to either prioritize safe driving or the secondary navigation task. Results show that participants met the required task objective by varying the frequency that they interleaved tasks and by varying the amount of time they spent in between visits to the secondary display. We explain these data using a framework for modeling driver distraction effects. The model explained the observed change in performance measures between the two priority conditions and also the observed change in strategy. Taken together these results support the idea that people can strategically allocate attention in multitask settings to meet specific performance criteria.,>Duncan Brumby>Nina  del Rosario >Christian Janssen,>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0550/index.html
2010,When More Load Leads to Less Distraction in Multimedia Learning: An Event-Related Potential Approach,"In multimedia learning, the modality effect occurs when students learn better from a lesson containing graphics accompanied by narration than one accompanied by on-screen text. The redundancy effect occurs when students learn better from a lesson containing graphics accompanied by narration than one accompanied by narration and on-screen text. In order to determine the information-processing mechanisms responsible for these effects, 36 students viewed three multimedia lessons in which the words were presented as narration, on-screen text, or both. During the lessons, brief visual distractors were presented and event-related potentials (ERPs) in response were measured. Learners showed a more positive early (P1) ERP response during the graphics+text lesson than during the graphics+narration+text lesson, indicating that more perceptual processing was required for the latter condition. In general, results suggested that perceptual load plays an important role in the modality and redundancy effects, a useful clarification of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning.",>Krista DeLeeuw>Richard Mayer>Barry  Giesbrecht,">Knowledge Media Research Center>University of California, Santa Barbara>University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0551/index.html
2010,Information Search in Decisions from Experience: Do Our Patterns of Sampling Influence Our Decisions?,"Does the way we sample information from the environment influence the decisions we make, even when the information we obtain would otherwise be equivalent? In past research, this question has been difficult to answer because the information we obtain is often confounded with its consequences. We investigate this question by analyzing data in a paradigm where exploration comes prior to consequential decision-making, in the binary choice paradigm of decisions from experience. By investigating the relationship between patterns of information sampling and subsequent decisions, we find that individuals who switch more between options are less sensitive to the sample means and more likely to make decisions based on the outcome of pairwise comparisons, especially recent outcomeschoosing options that win most of the time. We further show that such pairwise strategies are associated with the underweighting of rare events.",>Thomas Hills>Ralph Hertwig,>University of Basel>University of Basel,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0552/index.html
2010,The sensory nature of knowledge,"The aim of the present studies are to assess the sensory nature hypothesis of knowledge through a series of experimental results. Especially, we investigated the links between memory and perception using a short-term priming paradigm based on a previous learning phase consisting of the association between a geometrical shape and a white noise. The priming phase examined the effect of a geometrical shape, seen in the learning phase, on the processing of a target (tones or picture). Our main results demonstrate that memory and perception share some mechanisms and components. These ones are relevant for the processing of each form of knowledge (episodic and semantic). At last, reflections about the implication of this work to study perceptual learning and memory are presented.",>Lionel Brunel>Guillaume  Vallet >Benoit  Riou>Mathieu Lesourd>Elodie  Labeye>Rémy Versace,>University lyon 2>University lyon 2>University lyon 2>University lyon 2>University lyon 2>University lyon 2,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0553/index.html

Three empirical studies consistently revealed that there indeed exists a preference for wrong predictions even when predictions are made by experts. In addition, the current research also formulates preferences for wrong predictions made by experts in terms of a Bayesian inference and expresses the processes by which one may believe the wrong prediction in the form of two factorsprior odds and likelihood ratio. Finally, I argue that this preference is logical when treated as a result of the comparison between the two competing hypotheses.",>Kuninori Nakamura,>Tokyo Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0554/index.html
2010,Change in Encoding Facilitates Principle Acquisition,This study addresses the interaction between stimulus encoding and learning. Specifically I address the acquisition of arithmetic principle knowledge and its relation to learners arithmetic equation encoding. Arithmetic principle knowledge has been shown to be a key aspect of early mathematical development. Behavioral results suggest that children with experience encoding relevant characteristics show a change in their principle knowledge. Computational results mirror this finding. Model instantiations in which the same equation encoding is used show similar behavior. I take this as preliminary evidence of a direct connection between the encoding of arithmetic equations and knowledge in the arithmetic domain. This has clear applications to both developmental theory and educational practice.,>Richard Prather,>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0555/index.html
2010,Complementary processing systems: A PDP model of the simultaneous perception of multiple objects,"Illusory conjunctions in normal and simultanagnosic subjects are instances where the binding of visual information fails to function correctly. When presented with multiple objects simultaneously, simultanagnosic patients and normal subjects under conditions of attentional loads or brief presentation times often erroneously report miscombinations of features of the objects. A connectionist model of multi-object perception examines how the concurrent perception of more than one object could occur in normal subjects and become deficient with shortened processing times. In this model, the correct identification of two objects is accomplished through lateral connections between the ventral and dorsal pathways. Lesioning of the dorsal pathway produces failures in multi-object recognition characteristic of the effect of parietal damage in simultanagnosia. It is hoped that the functioning of this model might help elucidate possible processes underlying the correct solution of the binding problem in normal subjects.",>Cynthia Henderson>James McClelland,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0556/index.html
2010,Ascribing Causality and Intention to 2D Animations,"People routinely ascribe intentions and other mental states to others (partly) on the basis of observed behavior, and research shows that they tend to do this spontaneously, even with simple geometric objects moving in a 2D plane. We believe that 2D animations isolate a critical kind of information  object movement  that avatars and social robots could use when making attributions in social interaction. Our approach uses spatiotemporal, contoured constraints about objects and their movements to identify candidate causes and intentions, and then, based on evidence from background knowledge, infers which is most likely. This approach could eventually be integrated with perceptual information, such as appearance or gaze, as well as richer models of the world and other agents' minds, in order to augment the social intelligence of artificial agents.",>David Pautler>Bryan Koenig>Boon-Kiat Quek>Andrew Ortony,">A*STAR Singapore>A*STAR Singapore>A*STAR Singapore>A*STAR Singapore,, Northwestern University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0557/index.html

In two experiments, we examined limits in monitoring performance and working memory retention as the number of items to be held and monitored varied from one to eight. In Experiment 1, participants monitored a display on the basis of a static memory load. In Experiment 2, participants sometimes updated the memory load by substituting new information in the display. Both monitoring and retention were quite good in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, monitoring performance was compromised even with a single-item load, and retention was poor for loads greater than 4 or 5 items.

Hick's law is the very strong experimental finding in multiple-choice research that mean response time increases with the logarithm of the number of response options. In the RDM task participants have to indicate from a group of moving dots what the dominant direction of movement is. We studied how response times in this task increased as a function of the number of alternative directions of movement presented to the participants. Using a computational model, we show that Hick's law is present, but only if the relative distance between the alternative directions of movement is taken into account.",>Leendert van Maanen>Eric-Jan Wagenmakers,>University of Amsterdam>University of Amsterdam,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0559/index.html
2010,Are Place Names Merely Referencing Expressions?,"Previous research found cross-modality priming for the names of well-known people and landmarks, but not for nouns or country names (Hollis & Valentine, 2001). Hollis and Valentine argue that country names were processed like nouns because they have sense (i.e. they can act as adjectives) and are therefore not pure referencing expressions. However, it could be argued that the participants processed country names like nouns because they possessed richer knowledge about countries (e.g. culture, climate, political structure) than about landmarks. The current study used locality names that cannot act as adjectives to test this interpretation. No cross-modality priming was found for locality names, indicating that they are processed like nouns. One possible interpretation of these findings is that the richness of the mental representation associated with a given place name determines whether it will be processed as a noun. &c; Crown Copyright 2010 Reproduced by permission of Ordnance Survey.",>Paula Engelbrecht>Michael Tull,>Ordnance Survey>University of Portsmouth,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0560/index.html
2010,Sociocultural history of the machine metaphor,"Most theories of metaphor in modern cognitive linguistics either highlight the metaphorical system of human beings in general or describe differences in metaphorical systems of various cultures as a fact and do not explain the reason for these differences. When does some metaphor appear in the language? Why does it appear in this period of time but not earlier or later? Such questions sound weird in the context of this discourse, but prove to be important for understanding of sociocultural nature of some basic metaphors. The most obvious answer to these questions is: metaphor appears in language when its source domain begins to play an important role in social life. However, the history of metaphor of machine shows that this answer is not always correct. The metaphor of machine was not known in antiquity, but it had appeared in the Middle Ages long before the machines became widely used.",>Vladimir Glebkin,">Gymnasium 1514, Moscow",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0561/index.html

This question was addressed in the case of Agile software development, which emphasizes collaboration. Evidence suggests that the keys to success in Agile are two physical artifacts: the ""story card"" and the ""wall."" These artifacts are particularly useful when supported by appropriate social interactions. Thus, we conducted an ethnography study of an Agile team and used situated cognition to study their communication process. We found that members perform a categorization process both at the perceptual and conceptual level, which is akin to structural coupling. The physical artifacts play a mediation role to helped members form and sustain the structural coupling process, both together well as individually. This, in turn, helped them to sustain common ground and decrease the flux of the individuals and groups representation of system design.",>Nik Nailah Binti Abdullah>Robert G.M Hausmann>Shinichi Honiden>Helen Sharp,">GRACE Center, National Institute of Informatics>Carnegie Learning Incorporation>GRACE Center, National Institute of Informatics>Centre for Research in Computing, The Open University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0562/index.html
2010,The Influence of Prior Knowledge on Recall for Height,"Many aspects of our experiences do not have to be explicitly remembered, but can be inferred based on our knowledge of the regularities in our environment. Such knowledge can operate at multiple levels of abstractions. For example, this could lead to recall for the height of a particular person to be influenced not only by general knowledge about heights of people, but also by specific knowledge about the height of men and women. We assess the relative contribution of this type of prior knowledge on reconstructive memory. In a series of behavioral studies we first assessed peoples a priori expectations of the heights of men and women. We show that peoples a priori expectations are in line with the true distribution of heights in the population. We then tested memory performance in a continuous recall task in which subjects had to reconstruct from memory the height of people shown earlier in a sequence. The stimuli were either naturalistic images of males and females or gender-ambiguous silhouettes. Our results suggest not only that prior knowledge can improve average recall, but also that knowledge can come from multiple levels of abstraction such as gender and the overall height of people.",>Pernille Hemmer>Jenny Shi>Mark  Steyvers,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0563/index.html

The advantage of this approach is that cognitive load can be determined implicitly by monitoring variations in specific multimodal input features executed during day to day tasks using a computer interface. Such unobtrusive measures may help determine the users cognitive load in real-time, and achieve the ultimate goal of adapting information selection and presentation in a dynamic computer interface with reference to load. We identified some correlations between the communicative structure of combined speech and manual gesture input and high levels of cognitive load. The results suggest that semantic multimodal communicative structures are sensitive to cognitive load variations, with multimodal communication becoming half as redundant in high load than in low load. The feasibility of using rates of redundant constructions or complementary constructions in multimodal input as an index of cognitive load is supported by the results of our study.",>Natalie Ruiz>Ronnie Taib>Fang Chen,">NICTA, UNSW>NICTA, UNSW>NICTA, UNSW",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0565/index.html

We need one criterion to count satisfactorily as an explanation of consciousness in information processing. An operational working definition of consciousness could be made in comparison of memory and attention: Consciousness would be a subjective awareness of momentary experience and also have the characteristics of an operating system performing control and consolidation information processing, even though those are not equivalent concepts. This could be called a cognitive consciousness. If cognitive consciousness is postulated as a mental construct characterizing awareness, control and consolidation, the phenomena like word superiority effect, auditory continuity and object categorization, could be understood clearly, which was not the case in the past.",>Eunsook Kim>Hyunjung Shin,">Interdisciplinary Research Program of Cognitive Science,, Pusan National University,, South Korea>Department of Psychology,, Pusan National University,, South Korea",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0566/index.html

This paper compares the effectiveness of three social influence strategies in terms of their ability to lessen their readers affiliation for a targeted social group. We designed three messages that vary in terms of (a) how well they hide their persuasive intent and (b) clarity of the message. Our results indicate that message clarity had a stronger impact on peoples group affiliation than the persuasive intent of the message. The most rhetorical and blunt Message 1 was more effective in reducing peoples affiliation for the targeted group than the more subtle narrative Messages 2 & 3. The most subtle Message 3 was least effective in terms of being able to reduce subjects affiliation for the targeted group.,>M.

2010,Category directedness,"The answer to the question of what constitutes a category generally comes in two guises. The first refers to the set of characteristic features associated with the category (category intension). The second refers to the set of items in the world that is delineated by the category (category extension). Although intension and extension are two complementary depictions of what a category is, little is known about their interrelation. We will present a theory of semantic categories that assumes both exemplars and features to vary along a common latent scale. Evidence for this theory will be provided through an analysis of feature by exemplar applicability matrices with the two parameter logistic model. This item response model for unidimensional data not only fits the applicability matrices, its parameters naturally account for the varying representativeness of the constituting features and exemplars.",>Steven Verheyen>Gert Storms,>University of Leuven>University of Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0568/index.html

Performance in Exp. 1 was uniformly low, indicating a floor effect in sentence information recall. Exp. 2 showed significantly better recognition memory for sentences containing the direct marker vs. the indirect marker in Turkish; no such advantage was observed in English.

Although early work emphasized that PL often involved discovery of abstract invariants from stimulation (Gibson, 1969), most recent work has focused on concrete, low level stimulus properties. We describe research to understand abstract perceptual learning (APL), which requires discovery of structural relations between features, and compare it to concrete PL. Learners discovered hidden targets  10 squares of the same luminance embedded in 12x12 grids of varying luminance noise. Concrete targets maintained pixel position and luminance across trials. Abstract targets changed either position or luminance across trials. In a discovery task, humans were able to discover both concrete and abstract patterns.

2010,Metathesis in English and Hebrew: A Computational Account of Usaged-Based Phonology,"It is now well understood that language use shapes the acoustic delivery of phonological patterns. One common example of this type of language change-under-use is metathesis, which is the reversal of the expected linear ordering of sounds. The gradual transformation of the Spanish word chipotle to chipolte in the United States is an example of metathetic change. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is an optimization technique loosely based on the idea of natural selection. This paper shows that the GA can provide a computational model of a usage-based account of examples of metathesis. In the process, it argues that computer models can bring precision to linguistic theory. As an example we create a GA that is able to characterize metathesis in English and then is able to achieve even better results for related expressions in modern Hebrew.",>Paul De Palma>George Luger,">Gonzaga University, University of New Mexico>University of New Mexico",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0571/index.html

The first approach considers such memory advantages to be a property of the concepts themselves while the second approach emphasizes the role played by the context in which such concepts appear in allowing a reader to make sense of them. The context-based view also suggests that counterintuitive concepts lose their advantages as they become widely accepted and embedded in a cultural milieu. In the new context, ideas with enhanced counterintuitivess obtain transmission advantages. This helps explain cultural innovation and dynamism. It also allows us to account for the development and spread of complex cultural ideas such as the overly counterintuitive religious concepts including the Judeo-Christian-Islamic conceptions of God.",>M.

The order of occurrence of the constituents of two types of conceptual combinations, Relation and Property, was manipulated in view of determining how property-based and relation-based interpretations evolve with age. Three groups of French-speaking children (ages 6, 8, and 10) and a group of adults performed an interpretation-selection task. The results for the children indicated that while property-based interpretations increased with age, relation-based interpretations were in the majority for both combination types, whereas for the adults, relation-based interpretations were in the minority for property combinations. For the children and adults alike, the most frequent interpretations were ones in which the head noun came first and was followed by the modifier (the opposite of the order observed for English).",>Sandra Jhean-Larose>Fabiola  Martinez,">Université Paris Sorbonne /I.U.F.M. de Paris, Equipe CHArt (Cognitions Humaine et Artificielle)- E.P.H.E, 41, Rue Gay-Lussac.75005 Paris.

2010,Interactive Representation in the Motor Control,"Within the approach to embodied representation, Bickhards (1993, 2000) account of interactive representation, like Rosenberg & Andersons (2004) guidance theory of representation, employs a notion of representation that is not grounded on the standing-in-for relation. However, Bickhards accounts of interactive representation remains in need of explanation as to why the interactive representation is genuine representation. The present paper aims at this explanation, with the focus of anticipatory motor activities, by employing Merleau-Pontys notion of motor intentionality (Merleau-Ponty, 2006). For this, the present paper explains how the interactive representation relates to motor performance in its immediate environment, in other words, how the interactive representation gains its intentional content. In addition, the present paper argues that the interactive representation of motor activities provides the guidance of motor actions, and vice versa, hence Bickhards notion of interactive representation and Rosenberg & Andersons guidance theory of representation are two versions of the same theory.",>Daniel Hsi-wen Liu,>Providence University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0574/index.html

Of particular interest to this paper is the theoretical aspect of weakly supervised learning: (a) Could weakly supervised learning learn the target concept the same as that of fully supervised learning? (b) If yes, under what conditions it will and how to achieve it? In other words, this paper will investigate what weakly supervised learning could do and what could not. The basic idea is, weakly supervised learning could be transformed into an equivalent supervised learning problem, in which way, it could be understood with the tools of supervised learning. The major results of the paper include: (a) the hardness of weakly supervised learning depends on the properties of training data and the adopted feature representation; (b) though there is no theoretical guarantee for a unique identification of the relevant variables, incorporating minimum description length principle may help infer target concept; (c) weakly supervised learning could be solved by EM-style algorithm, which is not a novel idea, however, the theoretical analysis suggests that the E-step and M-step should adopt feature representations with distinct properties rather than using the same feature.",>Jinhui Yuan>Bo  Zhang,>Tsinghua University>Tsinghua University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0576/index.html
2010,Models of Information Integration in Perceptual Decision Making,"In cognitive science there is a seeming paradox: On the one hand researchers studying judgment and decision making (JDM) have repeatedly shown that people employ simple and often sub-optimal strategies when integrating information from multiple sources. On the other hand another set of researchers has had great success using Bayesian optimal models to explain information integration in fields such as categorization, perception, and memory. One impediment to reconciling this paradox lies in the different experimental methods each group has used. Recently, Hotaling, Cohen, Busemeyer, & Shiffrin (submitted) conducted a perceptual decision making study designed to bridge this methodological divide and test whether the sub-optimal integration found in verbal problems stated in terms of probabilities may also appear in perceptual tasks. Their results indicate that a classic JDM finding, the dilution effect, does arise in perceptual decision making. Observers were given strong evidence X favoring A over B, and weak evidence Y also favoring A over B. According to Bayesian analysis, the odds in favor of A should be multiplied, resulting in an increased likelihood of A. Instead, Hotaling et al. found that the weak evidence diluted the strong evidence, producing decreased judgments and choice probabilities favoring A, given X & Y, than given X alone. I review these empirical findings and test both rational and cognitive models of the integration process.",>Jared Hotaling>Andrew Cohen>Jerome Busemeyer>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>University of Massachusetts>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0577/index.html
2010,The Influence of Integration and Counterintuitiveness on Memory for Text,"Recent studies suggest that counterintuitive ideas embedded in stories facilitate their subsequent recall, thus increasing the likelihood that such stories survive time and space. However, it could be that structure of counterintuitive stories affects memory rather than the distinctiveness of their contents. Indeed, Harmon-Vukic and Slone (2009) demonstrated that integration of story information eliminated the counterintuitiveness effect. The purpose of the present experiment was to further explore the influence of integration on memory for counterintuitive concepts. Participants were presented with a story containing elements that were either intuitive, minimally counterintuitive, or maximally counterintuitive. In addition, the stories were either integrated or not integrated. Participants were asked to recall the material either immediately, or one week later. Consistent with the results of Harmon-Vukic and Slone recall performance was best for integrated stories, regardless of level of intuitiveness. The same effect occurred on week later, although overall memory performance was lower.",>M.

2010,An Attention Based Theory to Explore Affordances of Textual and Diagrammatic Proofs,"Shimojima and Katagiri have demonstrated that diagrams reduce inferential load during reasoning by scaffolding visual-spatial aspects of memory. In response, we wondered why, if this is true, that proofs are usually text based? The purpose of this paper is to explore ergonomic affordances of text that may encourage its use in the communication of proofs by building on prior work in attention. We claim that textual notations may focus a reasoners spotlight of attention through serialized sequential chunks, whereas many diagrams may diffuse attention and that a diagrammatic notation system that serialized information in chunks amenable to focused attention could leverage the power of textual notations. We present such an example through a case study focused on generalized constraint diagrams, a visual logic with attributes that may support focused attention and extract ergonomic principles that may transcend each notation system.",>Peter Coppin>James  Burton,>University of Toronto>University of Brighton,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0579/index.html
2010,Socially Facilitated Alignment and Novelty in Separate Channels of Communication,"We discuss two viewpoints of potential interactive alignment, socially facilitated priming and socially facilitated novelty, and test them by using simulated online conversation. In a computer-based pseudo-interactive environment, participants were led to believe they were interacting with another person or that they were seeing examples from a database and must supply 12 responses. The exchange consisted of a modified game of I never. In both conditions, nine prompt sets were presented in which the verb, tense, topic, and presence of emoticons varied. Recall was also tested. Results show that those who believed they were conversing with another person aligned less than those who believed they were seeing examples, but recalled more of the prompts. In addition, those who believed they were talking to another person used more emoticons than those who believed they were seeing examples. We suggest that a more complex theory of alignment is necessary in which different levels of alignment, including but not limited to topical and emotional, are modulated differentially to account for the flow and drive of conversation.",>Monica Riordan>Rick Dale>Roger Kreuz,>University of Memphis>University of Memphis>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0580/index.html
2010,The Influence of Causal Information on Memory for Misinformation,Causal information has been characterized as a mental glue that binds ideas together in the mind. This experiment tests the influence of such causal binding in a traditional memory misinformation paradigm. Participants studied information that either appeared as individual traits or as traits connected by causal links. Participants then rated a series of traits that contained both true and misinformation items. Misinformation items were created to be causally plausible or implausible alternatives to previously learned information. Our question was whether the presentation of causal links in the study phase would affect the reporting of misinformation in later phases. Participants in the causal version of the study phase were more influenced by misinformation items that were causally plausible than items that were causally implausible. Participants in the noncausal version of the study phase were not differentially influenced by the plausibility of misinformation lures. Explanations for these results are discussed.,>Jessecae Marsh>Sarah Kulkofsky,>Texas Tech University>Texas Tech University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0581/index.html
2010,The Interaction of Age and Skill for Recognition of Chess Positions,"Even young chess players display superior recall for chess positions (Chi, 1978; Horgan & Morgan, 1990; Schneider, Gruber, Gold, & Opwis, 1993), which has been attributed to their greater chess knowledge and available patterns and chunks (Chase & Simon, 1973). Controlling for skill no effect of age has generally been found in youth chess players on chess tasks. This study demonstrates, a strong effect of age, where older children are better able to recognize chess positions. Additionally this study uncovered an interaction between age and skill whereby older children who are better at chess do much better then other groups. We propose that older children use deeper processing techniques to scaffold the complex memory structures that support chess playing, which may not be automatically applied to an unfamiliar task.",>Jerad H.

2010,Thinking Ahead: How Children Reason About the Future,"Episodic future thinking relies heavily on self-projection, i.e., projecting oneself into the future. It involves the use of episodic and semantic memory in order to plan and anticipate future need. In our study, we focused on understanding the role of self in episodic future thinking in 3- and 4-year old children. Children were asked to make choices either for their own future need (self group) or for another individual's future need (other group). Including these groups allowed us to directly manipulate the role of self. Participants were shown a 3-D model of a neighborhood with several locations (houses and stores) and were asked to navigate around the neighborhood to achieve a future goal requiring a two-step action (go to toy store to buy present and then go to friend's house to give present). In one version of the study, children were given only a few choices of locations in the neighborhood in order to achieve their goal. Preliminary results suggest that both 3- and 4-year-old children demonstrate episodic future thinking by accurately following the actions to achieve the future goal. In the second version of the study, 2 additional choices of location were added to the neighborhood, while keeping the goal the same. These additional items served as distracters in the environment. Results show that while 4-year-old children still demonstrate episodic future thinking skills, 3-year-old children are no long able to accurately follow the actions necessary to achieve the future goal. Further research on optimal performance by 3-year-old in such visual working memory and episodic future thinking tasks is necessary.",>Janani Prabhakar>Judith Hudson,">Rutgers University, New Brunswick>Rutgers University, New Brunswick",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0583/index.html
2010,When Distance Relationship Contradicts Similarity in SUSTAIN,"SUSTAIN is an influential multiple clusters (i.e., prototypes) model for categorization, in which the cluster nearer to the stimulus is activated for categorization. Due to that the cluster activation is the average of the dimensional similarity weighted by attention, the choice between clusters is little influenced by the dimension on which the similarity difference to the stimulus between clusters is negligible, even with equivalent dimensional attention weights and the clusters having the same distance difference on dimensions (e.g., 1 vs.2 on dimension 1 and 4 vs.5 on dimension 2). This is evident in modeling Experiment 1 in Erickson and Kruschke (1998) that SUSTAIN activates the rule-category cluster, which is actually farther to the critical item than the exception-category cluster. The computer simulation results suggest that the larger the learning rate, the more likely this similarity-distance contradiction occurs. With the SUSTAIN using the ALCOVE's similarity computation equation, this contradiction disappears.",>Chung-Yu Wang>Lee-Xieng Yang,>National Cheng-Kung University>National Chengchi University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0584/index.html
2010,Adaptive Information Indexing in Re-finding Information,We studied how the human cognitive system adaptively performs information indexing (i.e. knowing where to re-find information without necessarily knowing the information content). Participants searched for information using computer icons with or without locations or luminance cues. The cues represented the history of use of icons and were calculated using the ACT-R memory equation. Results suggest that participants adaptively used the location/luminance cues to offload information indexing from internal memory to external cues. Availability of location cues led to more frequent icon accesses and worse recall of icon titles. Availability of luminance cues led to worse recall of icon titles and locations. Participants adapted to the cost-benefit structure of the environment by strategically shifting the use of different kinds of external cues based on their relative access costs. Results highlight the dynamic interplay between external representations and human information processes in shaping adaptive interactive behavior in information search and indexing.,>J.

2010,Variability Helps Children Balance a Beam,"Basic-level research suggests that learning about an event is a function of what is being attended to and what is being ignored rather than amount of time spent exploring the event. However, what about learning to overcome a misconception, such as the task of balancing an asymmetrically weighted beam away from center? This research investigated the effects of training variability for children trying to balance visually symmetrical yet proprioceptively asymmetrical beams on a fulcrum. Results indicate that (i) older childrens judgments of a beams weight distribution improved with experience, (ii) younger children had particular difficulty distinguishing between the heavier and lighter side when the weight difference was smallest, and (iii) children in the mixed-experience condition scored fewer errors than children who received more extensive experience but in just one type. The findings of a significant quadratic trend for effect of learning underscore the importance of variability in childrens experience.",>David Pfeiffer>Daniel Bullard>Heidi Kloos,>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0586/index.html
2010,Mutual Alignment Analogy Facilitates Abstraction and Transfer of a Complex Scientific Principle,"Learning about a scientific principle often occurs in the context of unfamiliar examples. Mutual alignment analogya type of analogical comparison in which the analogs are only partially understoodhas been shown to facilitate learning from unfamiliar examples (Kurtz, Miao, & Gentner, 2001; Loewenstein, Thompson, & Gentner, 1999, 2003). The present study examined the role of mutual alignment analogy in the abstraction and transfer of a complex scientific principle from examples presented in expository texts. The results provide evidence that promoting comparison between two examples and orienting the learner toward the relational commonality between the examples result in greater abstraction and transfer of the principle ""convergent evolution"". These findings suggest that mutual alignment analogy can promote learning complex scientific principles from texts. Mutual alignment analogy is therefore likely to be a helpful learning aid and pedagogical technique in science education.",>Judy Orton>Florencia Anggoro>Benjamin Jee,>Georgia State University>College of the Holy Cross>College of the Holy Cross,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0587/index.html
2010,A Lexical Gap in the Humor Domain of Japanese and Its Possible Implications for Theories of Conceptual Language,"Interviews with native speakers of Japanese reveal that, within the humor domain, Japanese experiences a lexical gap, lacking terms for ethnic, political, and religious humor and their corresponding preference terms. However, Japanese terms do exist for the same concepts in non-humorous domains but yet, they do not cross into the humor domain, thus pointing to a specific phenomenon within the language. These limited data may indicate a variation in the minds conceptual structure or, perhaps more likely, of the concepts realizations as lexical items depending on ones native language. Not to fall into Whorfs overgeneralization, this may still suggest that the acceptable application of a concepts expression in a language is more than simply a linguistic variation and but may still be the consequence of a languages influence on conceptual structure, resulting in its deliberate and possibly societaly and ethically conventionalized deviation from the organization of the language-independent ontology.",>Whitney Vandiver,>Purdue University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0588/index.html
2010,"Reactive Task-Set Switching Ability, Not Working Memory Capacity, Predicts Change Blindness Sensitivity","Individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) have long been shown to predict how well people perform tasks that require directed attention, but other individual differences responsible for task-set switching and noticing behaviors are less well understood. In this study, students from California State University, Northridge completed a measure of WMC, a measure of cognitive flexibility, and attempted to identify disappearing objects in change blindness slides. WMC had no relationship with the other measures, but measures of cognitive flexibility were directly correlated with the ability to notice change, and no relationships were established. The author argues that these findings support: 1) new ways of thinking about task-set switching behaviors, and 2) the existence of individual differences in the ability to notice changes in an environment that are independent of WMC.",>Robert Youmans,">California State University, Northridge",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0589/index.html

Concept acquisition, metaphor, pattern recognition, priming, predictions, inferences; all these processes rely on similarity. Despite its relevance, relatively little is understood about how similarity is processed. In particular, there is a need to better understand the scope in which our perceptual systems constrain our judgments of similarity. The current study investigates this question in the area of visual cognition. By attempting to control for the influence of categorical knowledge, the goal was to understand how different types of feature-dimensions and category boundaries influence the perception of similarity.

The current study examined how these two processes may influence preschoolers performance in different VPT tasks. Eighty-four 3~5-year-old children and 8 adult controls completed three VPT tasks, where different conditions were set to manipulate the requirement to perform transformation and to solve interference. The result showed that 4-year-olds could solve the interference between reality and imagination, but the immature spatial computation ability remained a confining factor throughout preschool years and prevented children from passing more complex VPT tasks.",>Yue Yu>Yanjie Su>Raymond Chan,">Department of Psychology and Yuanpei College, Peking University>Department of Psychology and Yuanpei College, Peking University>Neuropsychology and Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0591/index.html

The effect is measured by an object search task in which a target is located within repeated or nonrepeated visual contexts. Shorter response times with repeated configurations indicate that contextual information has facilitated search. Though the effect is robust among adult participants, recent tests of the effect with children yielded mixed results. Because contextual cuing could play a critical role in cognitive development, resolving this issue is important. The present study used child-friendly paradigms to investigate whether children show the effect. The study suggests that adult participants show the effect regardless of stimulus type; 9- to 12-year-old childrens contextual cuing effect was limited to certain stimuli types. The results are discussed in terms of the relation between visual complexity of stimuli and the recognition of search items.",>Hanako Yoshida>Kevin  Darby>Joseph Burling,>University of Houston>University of Houston>University of Houston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0592/index.html

In the first study, scores for 591 participants on the five factor model of personality were used to compute the personality vector known to be associated with creativity. Higher scores were significantly correlated with parental difference scores. In the second study, 114 participants were given questionnaires that included a measure of creativity (the Remote Associates Test), and a measure of creative personality (the Creative Personality Scale), as well as measures of parental behavior and personality, and parental conflict. Creativity scores and creative personality scores were significantly correlated with parental differences, but not with measures of parental conflict. We posit that the greater the parental differences, the greater the extent to which the childs worldview contains inconsistencies that invite contemplation, and thereby accustom the child to thinking for him/herself.",>Brian O'Connor>Liane Gabora,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0593/index.html

Finally, we argue that in the future our model may be used to simulate seemingly broad spectrum of memory research data: familiarity effects and rate of presentation effects in list memory, attention, false memory, instructions in memory tasks, and noise and phase transitions in neural networks and other dynamic systems.

2010,Cognitive leaps and multiple epistemological resources: an agent-based modeling approach,"Agent-based modeling (ABM) has been increasingly used by scientists to study a wide range of phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology. In these models, each element (agent) follows local, simple rules, and the overall macroscopic pattern emerges from these multiple local behaviors. Despite its roots in the natural sciences, ABM is highly relevant to research in the social sciences. The recent decades have seen a surge in social-science studies employing ABM, and more recently it has also been used to illustrate aspects of cognitive development, collaboration, and group work. In this paper, we describe a model to explain sudden leaps in cognition observed in a science classroom when students switch between the use of two types of epistemological resources. The model confirms that reliance on brute-force search is very sensitive to increased complexity of the content, whereas selective search is initially less efficient but more accurate for complex content.",>Paulo Blikstein,>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0596/index.html

Our analysis shows that there is a basic division between the two types of concepts (living things and artifacts), and that the division emerges partly from the fact that living things are highly interconnected as compared to artifact concepts in their attributes. Three network measures, density, clustering coefficients, and complete triplets, indicate that organic concepts are heavily clustered by their attributes as compared to non-organic artifacts.",>Takashi Yamauchi>Ricardo  Gutierrez-Osuna>James Caverlee,>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0597/index.html
2010,Development of the Semantic Network: From a random to a complex network,"In the present study, we investigate semantic knowledge of both adults and children for early learned words. Previous studies have suggested that semantic knowledge forms a network with particular properties, called a complex network. Since, in theory, a particular kind of network structure may be generated by a particular process, the structure of the semantic knowledge network found in semantic tasks has been supposed to reflect the developmental process of semantic knowledge acquisition. However, at this point, no empirical description is available for the development of childrens knowledge --adult substitutes are used. We investigate childrens semantic knowledge using an alternative-forced-choice association task. The result suggests that the childrens semantic network is closely approximated by a random network which is different from adults network. However, it is not truly random but contains a reliable structure. We discuss a possible developmental trajectory from a childrens random-like network to an adults complex network.",>Shohei Hidaka,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0598/index.html
2010,Predicting Coreference: the role of alternative constructions,"Expectations about alternative constructions play a crucial role in anaphora resolution. In a self-paced reading experiment, we presented Portuguese sentences, consisting of a main clause with two referents, followed by a subclause with a pronoun referring unambiguously to one of the referents. The sentences varied in the kind of subordinating conjunction: 'antes que' (before) vs. 'quando' (when). On the pronoun and the spill-over, there is a clear decrease in reading times for the conjunction 'antes que' in the object coreference condition, whereas no difference was not found for 'quando'. These results can be explained by comprehenders using an expectation-based strategy: in Portuguese, for sentences with 'antes que' there is a frequent alternative infinitive construction (antes de abrir: before opening), which allows coreference only with the subject of the preceding clause. Upon seeing the subordinate construction, comprehenders may assume that the speaker intended coreference with an antecedent other than the subject.",>Peter Baumann>Lars Konieczny>Barbara Hemforth,">University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg>CNRS, Universite Paris Descartes",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0599/index.html

Subjects viewed noise masked point light displays (PLDs) of humans and scrambled figures and determined whether a person was present in each trial. Non-biologically moving PLDs (polygons) served as control stimuli. Theta burst TMS was delivered over left premotor cortex, left STS, or vertex (Saygin, 2007, Brain). Sensitivity and response bias were both affected after premotor TMS (but not STS) which was due to an increase in false alarms. This effect was not found in the control task. These data suggest that the STS and premotor areas play dissociable roles in biological motion perception. The increased false alarms after premotor TMS suggests that this region may normally help refine the computations of posterior areas during biological motion perception.",>Bianca van Kemenade>Neil Muggleton>Vincent Walsh>Ayse Pinar Saygin,">University College London>University College London>University College London>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0600/index.html

The bulk of experimental research has focused on folk intuitions concerning determinism's relation to free will and moral responsibility. However, determinism is a difficult term for many folk to understand. Accordingly researchers often use comprehension questions to identify and exclude large proportions of participants who seem to struggle with relevant concepts. Here, we document some of the cognitive mechanisms involved in folk judgments related to comprehension of determinism, and its relations to free will and moral responsibility. Results provide prescriptions for experimental designs that can increase comprehension, potentially decreasing sampling biases.

Little is known, however, about the relative time courses and mechanisms by which different kinds of visual information influence language comprehension. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as participants read a subject-verb-object sentence and verified whether or not it matched different (verb-action versus role relations) aspects of a recently viewed picture. When the verb- action did not match the depicted action, we replicated larger N400s (300-500ms) over centro-parietal scalp to the verb (300- 500 ms) relative to the responses for matches. In contrast, ERP effects to role-relation mismatches (a person depicted as undergoing an action but described as performing it) qualitatively differed from and occurred prior to the verb-action congruence N400.

2010,Integrating Syntactic Knowledge into a Model of Cross-situational Word Learning,"It has been suggested that children learn the meanings of words by observing the regularities across different situations in which a word is used. However, experimental studies show that children are also sensitive to the syntactic properties of words and their context at a young age, and can use this information to find the correct referent for novel words. We present a unified computational model of word learning which integrates cross-situational evidence with the accumulated semantic properties of the lexical categories of words. Our experimental results show that using lexical categories can improve performance in learning, particularly for novel or low-frequency words in ambiguous situations.",>Afra Alishahi>Afsaneh  Fazly,>Saarland University>Shiraz University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0603/index.html
2010,Sentence Processing Mechanisms Influence Cross-Situational Word Learning,"Word learning has traditionally examined separately the role of constraints provided by the visual context (e.g. cross-situational learning) and the linguistic context (e.g. syntactic bootstrapping). We suggest that the combined investigation of these learning scenarios is important: Firstly, to determine whether cross-situational word learning applies when words are presented in sentences and, secondly, to illuminate possible interactions of linguistic and situational learning mechanisms. We conducted three experiments to examine the role of visual and linguistic contextual constraints during foreign language word learning. In particular, our studies show that, given a visual context, syntactic verb-argument constraints together with knowledge about plausible real-world action-object relations help to further enhance cross-situational word learning.",>Judith Koehne>Matthew W.

2010,Adaptive Constraints and Inference in Cross-Situational Word Learning,"Previous research shows that human learners can acquire word-referent pairs over a short series of individually ambiguous situations each containing multiple words and referents (Yu & Smith, 2007). In this kind of cross-situational statistical learning based on the repeated co-occurrence of words with their intended referents, the application of principles such as mutual exclusivity and contrast can leverage prior experience to reduce the complexity in situations with multiple words and multiple referents. However, these principles can also block the learning of one-to-many mappings. In a study analogous those done in traditional associative learning, we manipulate the early and late evidence for particular pairings in the cross-situational learning paradigm, and examine the effects on learning of both one-to-one and many-to-many mappings. Two major findings are: 1) participants use mutual exclusivity and contrast to facilitate learning; and 2) given sufficient evidence, learners can adaptively disregard these principles and learn many-to-many mappings.",>George Kachergis>Chen Yu>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0605/index.html
2010,Desirable Difficulties in Cross-Situational Word Learning,"The world offers learners a seemingly infinite number of word-to-world mappings (Quine, 1960). In order to account for how learners manage to accomplish such a difficult task, theories of word learning have proposed different tools that make the task of learning words easier. However, we propose that reducing difficulty may be detrimentaldifficulty may promote long-term word learning. We tested this hypothesis in a cross-situational paradigm in which object-label mappings were ambiguous during each learning event. The three conditions of learning (2 x 2, 3 x 3, and 4 x 4) varied in the degree of difficulty. Results revealed that, although difficulty deterred immediate performance, difficulty promoted long-term performance. We suggest that theory and research should shift from focusing on in-the-moment learning to examining both immediate and long-term learning. A complete theory of word learning not only accounts for word learning in the moment and on each time scale, but also integrates them in order to understand how they influence each other over time.",>Haley Vlach>Catherine  Sandhofer,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0606/index.html
2010,The Goldilocks Effect: Infants' preference for stimuli that are neither too predictable nor too surprising,"Even before birth, infants attend to the statistical properties of their sensory environments to learn about events in world. Tracking these statistics is crucial to mastery of visual, social, linguistic, and cognitive tasks. However, the degree to which their sampling follows prescriptions of rational statistical inference is unclear. Do infants' attentional preferences reflect efficient information gathering? We investigated using an ideal observer model (a Markov Dirichlet-multinomial). We predicted infants' attention to sequential events would be moderated by information content. We tested infants (7-8 months) with 32 unique event sequences (objects popping out of boxes) on a Tobii eye-tracker. Each sequence continued until look-away. Controlling for other variables, we found infants were significantly more likely to look away at either highly informative or uninformative events according to the model. This suggests infants allocate visual attention to maintain intermediate rates of information processing, avoiding committing cognitive resources to either overly predictable or surprising events. This ""Goldilocks effect"" may reflect a general strategy for efficient learning from environmental statistics.",>Celeste Kidd>Steven T. Piantadosi>Richard N.

2010,"Infants Visual Processing of Faces and Objects: Age-Related Changes in Interest, and Stability of Individual Differences","Longitudinal measures of infant visual processing of faces and objects were collected from a sample of healthy infants (N=40) every month from 6 to 9 months of age. Infants performed two habituation tasks each month, one with novel female faces as stimuli, and another with novel complex objects. Different individual faces and objects served as habituation (i.e., visual learning) and dishabituation (i.e., novelty response) stimuli. Measures included overall looking time to the habituation stimuli, slope of habituation, and recovery to the dishabituation stimuli. Infants were more interested in faces than objects, but this was contextualized by task order. The order effect suggests a habituation of habituation effect. Infants showed an age-related decrease in interest in objects, but no decrease in interest in faces. This contradicts claims that infants shift around 6-7 months from interest in faces to interest in objects. The results showed modest between-month stability of interest in faces, but little stability in any other behavioral measures.

One of the challenges in investigating mechanisms of sustained selective attention in young children is lack of appropriate experimental paradigms. This paper reports findings from a novel paradigm designed to investigate mechanisms of sustained selective attention in young children - the Object Tracking task. Results of two experiments with 3- to 5-year-old children provided support to the notion that development of the endogenous component of selective sustained attention lags behind the development of the exogenous component of this process. Importantly, the Object Tracking paradigm allowed investigating both of these components within the same task, thereby making it possible to attribute changes in performance to different mechanisms of attentional control rather than to differences in the level of motivation and engagement in different tasks.",>Anna Fisher,>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0609/index.html
2010,The Influence of Route Planning and its Execution on Spatial Learning,"We propose that spatial inferences made during planning and executing a route influence the learning of relative locations through wayfinding. In Experiment 1, separate and combined route plans were compared. The results suggest that inferring multiple directions during the initial stage of planning leads to more accurate representations of relative locations than planning a single route. In Experiment 2, regular and irregular updating modes during the execution phase were compared. The results suggest that irregular updating, which involves multidirectional self-to-object updating, also leads to more accurate representations than regular updating. We conclude that the requirement to make spatial inferences about multiple multidirectional metric interconnections in egocentric reference frames during wayfinding facilitates spatial learning.",>Kayoko Ohtsu>Yoshihiro Ouchi,>Waseda University>Teikyo-Gakuen Junior College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0610/index.html
2010,The Direction Bias and the Incremental Construction of Survey Knowledge,"This study examines how spatial memory acquired from navigation is used to perform a survey task involving pointing. Participants learned a route through a virtual city by walking it multiple times in one direction on an omnidirectional treadmill. After learning, they were teleported to several locations along the route, self-localized and pointed to multiple other locations along the route. Pointing was done away from or towards the current location. Preliminary data show that participants were faster in pointing away. This suggests that pointing was based on an incremental process rather than an all-at-once process which is consistent with mentally walking through a cognitive map or constructing a mental model of currently non-visible areas of the city. On average participants pointed faster to targets located further down the route towards the end than to targets located route upwards towards the start. Analysis of individual performance showed that more participants than expected by chance showed such an effect of target direction also in their pointing accuracy. The direction of this effect differed between participants. These direction biases suggest that at least some participants encoded the environmental space by multiple interconnected locations and used this representation also for pointing.",>Tobias Meilinger>Heinrich H.

2010,Alignment of Spatial Perspective,"Most of the experimental research on dialogue that has provided evidence for interactive alignment focuses on speakers aligning at the lexical and syntactic levels of representations and dialogic contributions, i.e., having converging choices of lexical and syntactic means of referring to pictured objects and events. Less is known about alignment at the conceptual level, or situation models. This paper addresses alignment in spatial perspective (route vs. survey perspective) between speakers in a confederate experimental task taking turns in describing routes on schematic maps. The findings of two experiments show that speakers spatial perspective choices are aligned with those of their partners both before and after partners switch perspective. Furthermore, this alignment effect holds both if partners show consistency adhering to the same perspective for a sequence of descriptions and when they display inconsistency by switching spatial perspective for every new description they provide.",>Elena Andonova,>University of Bremen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0612/index.html
2010,Spatial Representations with Conflicting Intrinsic Frames of Reference,"Establishing and updating spatial relationships between objects in the environment is vital to maintaining situation awareness. Wang et al. (2005) found that updating of spatial representations in the intrinsic frame of reference (IFOR) can be prioritized based on salience of task demands. But their study used a task environment with only one IFOR. Often a task environment has several objects in it which may be task-relevant, and they may conflict with each other in one or more ways such as by being oriented in differing directions. Two experiments manipulated relative spatial orientation and task salience of two task-relevant objects such that the objects orientations conflicted with each other and the task probabilistically demanded response based on the orientation of one or the other object. It was found that spatial updating in the IFOR was constrained by the limits of human attentional processes. Furthermore those constraints can be relaxed with practice.",>Franklin Tamborello>Yanlong Sun>Hongbin Wang,>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0613/index.html
2010,Learning from Environmental Regularities is Grounded in Specific Objects not Abstract Categories,"This paper examines statistical learning in the presence of predictive regularities at multiple levels of abstraction. Participants were presented with streams of pictures where picture order was predicted by both object identity and the categories these objects belong to. In Experiment 1, we establish that participants do learn based on the specific objects and not solely at the abstract, categorical level. In Experiment 2, we discount the possibility that participants gain abstract knowledge in addition to more concrete, object-based knowledge. Moreover, we consistently find equal learning in those who viewed the atypical exemplars and those who viewed the typical exemplars of the categories. Overall, our results suggest that when learning from environmental regularities, object-specific information takes precedence over more abstract, category level information when both are predictive.",>Lauren Emberson>Dani Rubinstein,>Cornell University>National Institute of Mental Health,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0614/index.html
2010,Adult language learners under cognitive load do not over-regularize like children,"The ""less is more"" hypothesis suggests that one reason adults and children differ in their language acquisition abilities is that they also differ in other cognitive capacities: for instance, the relatively poor memory and/or processing abilities of children may make them more likely to over-regularize inconsistent input (Singleton & Newport, 2004; Hudson Kam & Newport, 2005). We investigate this hypothesis by placing adults under a high cognitive load using a standard task. Does their tendency to over-regularize in a simultaneous language-learning task increase? Results indicate that although the cognitive load is high enough to impair overall learning, neither the presence of load nor poor working memory predicts greater overregularization. This suggests that if the ""less is more"" hypothesis explains over-regularization in children, the relevant cognitive capacity is not one that was impaired by our load task.",>Amy Perfors>Nicholas Burns,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0615/index.html

His rule requires the stability of certain conditional probabilities through time. We tested this assumption (""invariance"") from the psychological point of view. In Experiment 1 participants offered probability estimates for events in Jeffrey's candlelight example.

2010,Effects of Varied Priority Training on Complex Perceptual-Motor Learning,"We reported results from a study on the effects of different training methods on complex perceptual-motor skill acquisition using a version of the Space Fortress game, which was originally designed to study the acquisition of complex perceptual-motor and cognitive skills in a multi-tasking environment. Participants were randomly assigned to the Fixed Priority (FP) and Varied Priority (VP) training conditions. Action sequences for controlling the spaceship in a frictionless environment using a joystick were analyzed and compared across conditions. Consistent with the previous findings, VP training was in general more successful than FP training. However, we found that VP training benefited participants more in the low performance group than in the high performance group. Participants in the VP training condition showed faster learning of optimal action sequences and faster reduction of suboptimal action sequences. In addition, results showed that in the high performance group, participants in the VP training condition used significantly more optimal action sequences than in the FP training condition. The findings have important implications on how the effectiveness of different training methods can be optimized for people with different cognitive abilities.",>Yi Wang>Michelle Moon>Wai-Tat Fu>Walter Boot>Kirk Erickson>Arthur Kramer,>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>Carnegie Mellon University>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>Florida State University>University of Pittsburgh>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0617/index.html
2010,Non-verbal responses to being ignored: Evidence of cognitive deconstruction?,"This study examined peoples non-verbal reactions to being ignored or included during a social interaction. It was hypothesized that external judges could determine, on the basis of non-verbal cues, whether a person was ignored or included. Moreover, we expecteded that people who were ignored would become less non-verbally expressive, which could be indicative of cognitive withdrawal. It was found that persons who had been ignored reported lower average mood scores than included persons. External judges were, on average, also able to distinguish individuals who were ignored from those who were included. In terms of peoples specific non-verbal behaviors, however, the findings are less clear. Even though persons who were ignored engaged less in affiliative behaviors than included persons, they did not display more non-verbal behaviors that are indicative of withdrawal than included persons (e.g., flight).

2010,The Bodily Movements of Liars,"We measured the continuous bodily motion of participants as they lied to experimenters. These lies were spontaneous rather than elicited, and occurred for different motivations. In one situation, participants were given the opportunity to lie about their performance on a maths test in order to win money. In another, they witnessed one experimenter accidentally break a laptop. When asked what had happened, participants were motivated to lie and deny any knowledge. Across these situations, participants lied 61% of the time, allowing us to contrast the body movements of liars with truth tellers as they answered neutral and critical questions. Those who lied had significantly reduced bodily motion. In one case this motion appeared before the experimenter had even asked the critical question. We conclude that a persons bodily dynamics can be indicative of their cognitive and effective states, even when they would rather conceal them.",>Natasha Eapen>Sam Baron>Chris Street>Daniel Richardson,>University College London>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0619/index.html
2010,Exploring the mental space of autonomous intentional agents,"How do we use the motion of animate objects to make inferences about their intentions? We investigate this question using displays containing a number of autonomous, independently programmed agents moving about the screen and interacting with each other. Each agent behaves according to an independent autonomous program, controlled by a small number of parameters that define its ""personality."" We probe subjects' impressions of the similarities among the behaviors of the various agents, and then use multidimensional scaling to recover the subjective parameters defining the mental space of agent types. The most important variable turns out to be one that determines how the agent reacts to a nearby agent at one critical distance. A followup experiment suggests that variation along this parameter contributes to modulating a higher-level percept of how ""hostile"" or ""friendly"" the agents appear to be.",>Peter Pantelis>Jacob Feldman,>Rutgers University>Rutgers University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0620/index.html

2010,Learning from Errors in Game-Based versus Formal Mathematics Contexts,"Research suggests that educational games may be particularly useful for helping children learn STEM concepts; however, the mechanisms involved in game-based learning are not well understood. The present study tested the hypothesis that games are effective because they provide a supportive learning context that allows children to react adaptively to errors. Children (M age  7 yrs, 6 mo) were given two half-hour learning sessions in which they solved nontraditional arithmetic problems (e.g., __ = 3 + 4) in game and formal contexts. In a third session, children were given a transfer test in which they solved mathematical equivalence problems (e.g., 1 + 5 = __ + 2). Children who committed more of their learning errors in the game context solved a greater number of problems correctly on the transfer test than did children who made more of their errors in the formal context. Moreover, children reacted less negatively to errors made in the game context than in the formal context. These findings suggest that educational games may be an effective learning tool because they provide a supportive context that allows children to learn from errors.",>Lori Petersen>Jennifer Heil>Nicole McNeil>Gerald Haeffel,>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0624/index.html

In the current work we examine whether engaging in error correction processes can mitigate or eliminate the collaborative inhibition effect and perhaps even facilitate collaborative facilitation. Participants engaged in a writing error-detection and revision task while working either with a partner or individually. On the error-detection task, dyads found more structural flaws in the text, whereas individuals found more surface flaws. Moreover, when comparing dyads nominal groups the dyads did not show the collaborative inhibition effect. A similar pattern of results was found on the revision task.

2010,A Double Causal Contrast Theory of Moral Intuitions in Trolley Dilemmas,"In trolley dilemmas a train is about to kill several victims who could be saved if instead a different victim is harmed. A number of theories have been proposed which assume that permissibility judgments in these harm-based moral dilemmas are mediated by an analysis of the underlying causal structure. For example, it has been postulated that it is permissible to harm people as a side effect but not as a means. We have developed a different causal theory which claims that moral judgments are influenced by two contrasts, the global contrast between the number of victims in the presence and absence of the act, and an additional local contrast that compares the fates of the morally relevant target (i.e., threats, victims) of the proposed intervention in the presence versus absence of the act. This double causal contrast theory explains intuitions in various types of trolley dilemmas better than its competitors.",>Michael R.

2010,Deconfounding Distance Effects in Moral Reasoning,"A central question of moral philosophy and moral psychology is whether spatial distance is morally relevant (Kamm, 2007). Does spatial distance reduce our sense of obligation to help strangers in great need? One problem of assessing this question is that distance between agent and victim is typically confounded with other factors, such as saliency of the victims need, costs for the agent, or location of the agents means. The goal of our experiments is to find out whether spatial distance per se matters in peoples intuitions. Whereas the first two experiments seem to indicate that spatial distance between the agent and the victim or between the agents means and the victim affect subjects intuitions, Experiment 3 and a closer look at Experiment 2 both reveal that the assumed distance effects disappear if the compared cases are properly deconfounded. Implications of these findings for theories of psychological distance are discussed.",>Jonas Nagel>Michael Waldmann,">University of Göttingen, Germany>University of Göttingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0627/index.html
2010,Developing notions of free will: Preschoolers understanding of how intangible constraints bind their freedom of choice,"Our folk psychology involves the ability to reason about free will. In a series of experiments, we looked at young childrens ability to reason about their own freedom of choice, and contrast this with their ability to reason about situations that constrain it. We asked preschoolers (Range: 4 y; 1 mo.  5 y; 7 mo.) whether they had the choice to have done otherwise when they did not have the necessary knowledge to do so (epistemic constraint), had the moral duty not to do so (moral constraint), preferred not to do so (preference constraint), were told not to do so (permissive constraint), or were told that everyone else did not do so (conformist constraint). Results suggest that while preschool children generally believe their actions are freely chosen, they also understand how psychological, social and moral considerations may constrain their actions. These results have implications for childrens developing notions of free will and moral reasoning.",>Nadia Chernyak>Tamar Kushnir>Henry Wellman,>Cornell University>Cornell University>University of Michigan,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0628/index.html
2010,Dynamic Decision Making,"The experimental study of decision making has historically focused on simple single-trial judgement or reasoning tasks. However, real world behavior often necessitates online decision making, planning, and sequentially organized behavior. The goal of the proposed symposium is to bring together researchers who are working to understand the cognitive processes underlying this kind of ``dynamic decision making"" (defined as tasks or contexts that are structured as a sequence of interdependent decisions). A symposium on this topic is particularly timely since research in the area of dynamic decision making is having a tremendous impact on the field of psychology as a whole. First, researchers are converging on a set of novel computational modeling approaches that explain how decision makers plan sequences of multiple actions, take into account future contingencies, and react in real time to continually changing environmental dynamics. Second, many of the proposed algorithms and models are closely linked to neurobiological correlates (e.g., the recent explosion of research on neurobiology of reinforcement learning). Third, many of the tasks that are being developed for evaluating these models also appear to relate to important individual differences in real-world decision-making. The goal in the symposium is to 1) highlight some of the best work in this area, 2) to facilitate communication between researchers working on these problems from varying perspectives, and 3) to provide an excellent showcase of this area for members of the cognitive science community who may not yet be familiar with this work. The speakers who agreed to participate are all accomplished researchers in this area but each approach the set of problems involved in sequential decision making and learning from a slightly different perspective. The key topics covered include 1) how people plan sequences of actions to accomplish goals (Hotaling, Dimperio, & Busemeyer, Simon & Daw), 2) the underlying neurobiology of sequential decision making and planning (Simon & Daw), 3) how cognitive representations of the task or environment supporting planning and decision-making (Gureckis & Markant, Love & Otto, and Simon & Daw), and 4) how people balance exploration and exploitation in order to arrive at effective decision strategies in an unknown environment (Lee, Zhang, and Steyvers and Gureckis & Markant). In addition to these overlapping psychological themes, the researchers all share a core approach of applying sophisticated computational models to understand human behavior (including Bayesian approaches, reinforcement learning, and Markov Decision Processes).",>Todd Gureckis>Jared Hotaling>Michael  Lee>Bradley  Love>Dylan Simon,>New York University>Indiana University>UC Irvine>University of Texas at Austin>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0629/index.html
2010,The Active Role of Partial Knowledge in Cross-Situational Word Learning,"A number of modern word learning theories posit statistical processes in which knowledge is accumulated across many exposures to a word and its potential referents. Accordingly, words do not go directly from unknown to known, but rather pass through intermediate stages of partial knowledge. This work presents empirical evidence for the existence of such partial knowledge, and further demonstrates its active driving role in cross-situational word learning. Subsequently, an incremental model which leverages its partial knowledge of word-object mappings from trial to trial is shown to account well for the data. In contrast, models which do not do so cannot explain the data. These results confirm crucial assumptions made by statistical word learning models and shed light on the representations underlying the acquisition of word meanings.",>Daniel Yurovsky>Damian Fricker>Chen Yu>Linda Smith,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0630/index.html

An important question that needs to be answered then is how children learn low frequency items. In this study, we investigate the acquisition of meanings for low frequency words through computational modeling. We suggest that for such words, the familiarity of the context they appear in has an important effect on their acquisition. We note that context familiarity is confounded with another factor, namely the age of exposure to a word, and hence examine the independent role of each of the two factors on word learning.",>Afsaneh Fazly>Fatemeh  Ahmadi-Fakhr>Afra  Alishahi>Suzanne Stevenson,>Shiraz University>Shiraz University>Saarland University>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0631/index.html

The current study examines the role of familiarity with the objects and words on childrens retention in fast-mapping tasks. Twenty-four month-old infants were familiarized with either a series of novel objects or a series of novel names prior to the referent selection portion of a fast-mapping task. Infants retained the novel mapping after a delay when familiarized with the novel objects, but did not demonstrate retention when familiarized with the novel words. The results suggest familiarity with the object or word-form lead to differential encoding of the name-object link and altered subsequent word learning.",>Sarah C. Kucker>Larissa K.

2010,Attentional Control and Early Word Learning,There has been increasing interest in the role of early attention in the context of word learning. There has also been growing interest in attentional differences between bilinguals and monolinguals. The present study examined the relationship between mutual exclusivity and attentional control by comparing bilingual children whose attentional control is relatively advanced to age-matched monolingual children. The novel adjective learning paradigm was the word-learning measure and the Attention Network Test was the measure of attentional control. Three-year-old monolingual and bilingual children with similar vocabulary development participated. The results replicate earlier work on advanced attentional control among bilingual children and suggest that better performances in novel adjective learning by bilingual children might be due to attentional control. These findings support the importance of attention in early word mapping. The results add to a growing body of literature on the potential relevance of bilingualism in early word learning.,>Hanako Yoshida>Duc Tran>Viridiana  Benitez>Megumi  Kuwabara,>University of Houston>University of Houston>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0633/index.html
2010,A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Multisensory Perception,"We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model of multisensory perception based upon the Indian buffet process. The model includes a set of latent variables that learn multisensory features from unisensory data. The model is highly flexible because it makes few statistical assumptions. In particular, the number of latent multisensory features is not fixed a priori. Instead, this number is estimated from the observed data. We applied the model to a real-world visual-auditory data set obtained when people spoke English digits. Our results are consistent with several hypotheses about multisensory perception from the cognitive neuroscience literature. We found that the model obtained the statistical advantages provided by sensory integration. We also found that the model acquired multisensory representations that were relatively sensory invariant. Lastly, we found that the model was able to associate unisensory representations based on different modalities.",>Ilker Yildirim>Robert Jacobs,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0634/index.html
2010,Attention and cross-modal processing: Evidence from heart rate analyses,"The study of cross-modal processing has generated two seemingly contradictory sets of findings. Studies examining cross-modal processing in infants often find evidence that auditory input interferes with visual processing, whereas studies with adults often find evidence for visual input interfering with auditory processing. However, in the absence of amodal measures of auditory processing, it is possible that visual input also interferes with auditory processing in young infants. The primary goal of the current study was to examine this issue by focusing on Heart Rate (HR) to assess discrimination of unimodal auditory stimuli (Experiment 1), and to examine how visual stimuli affect auditory discrimination (Experiment 2). The results indicate that the presence of visual stimuli facilitated, rather than interfered with, auditory processing.",>Chris Robinson>Vladimir Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0635/index.html
2010,Evidence for auditory dominance in a passive oddball task,"Simultaneous presentation of auditory and visual input can often lead to visual dominance. Most studies supporting visual dominance often require participants to make an explicit response, therefore, it is unclear if visual input disrupt encoding/discrimination of auditory input or results in a response bias. The current study begins to address this issue by examining how multimodal presentation affects discrimination of auditory and visual stimuli, while using a passive oddball task that does not require an explicit response. Participants in the current study ably discriminated auditory and visual stimuli in all unimodal and multimodal conditions. Furthermore, there was no evidence that visual stimuli attenuated auditory processing. Rather, multimodal presentation sped up auditory processing (shorter latency of P300) and slowed down visual processing (longer latency of P300). These findings are consistent with research examining modality dominance in young children and suggest that visual dominance effects may be restricted to tasks that require an explicit response.",>Chris Robinson>Nayef Ahmar>Vladimir  Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0636/index.html

The current study examined the diagrammatic factors that may impact the effect this misunderstanding has on students ability to correctly interpret evolutionary trees. Students with weaker and stronger backgrounds in biology were presented with two cladograms, each featuring a different focal taxon (human or honeybee). The evolutionary relationships among the taxa were presented in four diagrammatic formats. Students reasoned in qualitatively different ways when asked about the human species as opposed to the honeybee, with specific diagrammatic formats facilitating anthropomorphic views, particularly among weaker background students.

More important than the initial representation was the participants transformed representations: if time was encoded in the lengths of tree links then inference was more accurate.

Based on experiments comparing subjects' performances in syllogism solving where logic diagrams of several different forms are used, we argue that internal manipulations of diagrams, or what we call internal constructions of diagrammatic proofs, actually exist, and that such constructions are naturally triggered even for users without explicit prior knowledge of their inference rules or strategies.",>Yuri SATO>Koji MINESHIMA>Ryo TAKEMURA,">Department of Philosophy, Keio University>Department of Philosophy, Keio University>Department of Philosophy, Keio University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0640/index.html
2010,Learning verb alternations in a usage-based Bayesian model,"One of the key debates in language acquisition involves the degree to which children's early linguistic knowledge employs abstract representations. While usage-based accounts that focus on input-driven learning have gained prominence, it remains an open question how such an approach can explain the evidence for children's apparent use of abstract syntactic generalizations. We develop a novel hierarchical Bayesian model that demonstrates how abstract knowledge can be generalized from usage-based input. We demonstrate the model on the learning of verb alternations, showing that such a usage-based model must allow for the inference of verb class structure, not simply the inference of individual constructions, in order to account for the acquisition of alternations.",>Christopher Parisien>Suzanne Stevenson,>University of Toronto>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0641/index.html
2010,Frequent Frames as Cues to Part-of-Speech in Dutch: Why Filler Frequency Matters,"The Frequent Frames model (Mintz, 2003) attempts to assign words to word categories based on their distributional patterns of usage. This model is highly successful in categorizing words in child-directed speech in English, but has been shown by Erkelens (2008) to be less effective with Dutch material. We show that extending the amount of contextual information in a frame by making use of the full utterance context does not improve categorization performance, but that constraining the fillers of Frequent Frames to be relatively less frequently occurring words does improve categorization significantly. We connect the latter result to a basic dichotomy in some languages between function words and content words, and conclude that, at least for English and Dutch, paying attention to this dichotomy is of greater importance for distributional bootstrapping proposals than the specific distributional contexts that are used to categorize words.",>Richard Leibbrandt>David Powers,">School of Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics, Flinders University>School of Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics, Flinders University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0642/index.html
2010,When More in Statistical Learning Means Less in Language: Individual Differences in Predictive Processing of Adjacent Dependencies,"Although statistical learning (SL) is widely assumed to play a key role in language, few empirical studies aim to directly and systematically link variation across SL and language. In this study, we build on prior work linking differences in nonadjacent SL to on-line language, by examining individual-differences in adjacent SL. Experiment 1 documents the trajectory of adjacency learning and establishes an individual-differences index for statistical bigram learning. Experiment 2 probes for within-subjects associations between adjacent SL and on-line sentence processing in three different contexts (involving embedded subject-object relative-clauses, thematic fit constraints in reduced relative-clause ambiguities, and subject-verb agreement). The findings support the notion that proficient adjacency skills can lead to an over-attunement towards computing local statistics to the detriment of more efficient processing patterns for nonlocal language dependencies. Finally, the results are discussed in terms of questions regarding the proper relationship between adjacent and nonadjacent SL mechanisms.",>Jennifer B. Misyak>Morten H.

We employ a model of statistical learning which uses sequential and semantic information to produce utterances from a bag of words. This linear learner is capable of generating grammatical questions without exposure to these structures in its training environment. We show that the model performs superior to n-gram learners on this task.

2010,Effector-specific Motor Interference in Action Simulation,"Neuroscientific findings suggest that observing temporally occluded actions evokes a mental simulation of the occluded action part. This action simulation may involve corresponding motor programs in the observer and is suggested to run in real time. The present study aimed to investigate whether real-time action simulation relies on effector-specific motor representations. Our participants watched transiently occluded actions performed either with the arms or the legs and had to predict the action course after occlusion. Participants also responded to the task with a movement involving either their arms or legs. Simulation performance broke down when the observed effector and the moved effector corresponded. In contrast, simulation was intact when the effectors did not correspond. The results are in line with previous research and extend it by showing that interference effects can occur within the real-time course of action simulation. Furthermore, shared representations between action simulation and action execution are effector specific.",>Peggy Tausche>Anne Springer>Wolfgang Prinz,>Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences>Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences>Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0645/index.html
2010,Simulation from Schematics: Dorsal Stream Processing and the Perception of Implied Motion,"Schematic language (e.g., prepositions) and depictions (e.g., line drawings) reduce the rich detail of the visual world to a coarser level of description. We investigated how these schematic forms may be represented in the brain. Recent neural evidence suggests that such representations may be computed in the dorsal pathway of the visual system, the same pathway involved in processing motion, including simulated motion in static scenes. Drawing on this association, we examined the stimulus conditions and mental sets that give rise to simulation, and by hypothesis, representations in the dorsal stream. Simulated motion was evident for scenes that were highly schematic, as opposed to highly realistic (Experiment 1), and when realistic scenes were processed schematically (Experiment 2). The results suggest that dorsal stream representations capture the schematic aspects of visual experience, rather than more fine-grained information. In affording simulation, these representations may facilitate certain types of reasoning and inference.",>Kevin J.

2010,Assessing Behavioral and Computational Approaches to Naturalistic Action Segmentation,"Recognizing where one action ends and another begins is an automatic and seemingly effortless process that supports understanding of goal-directed action. One characteristic of such action segmentation is that it is hierarchical; it reflects the goals and sub-goals of an actor, which correspond to coarse- and fine-grained action units respectively. We report on the success of one method of assessing hierarchical segmentation of naturalistic footage taken from an extensive corpus of unscripted human action (Speechome project, e.g., Roy et al., 2006). Results indicate that hierarchical segmentation occurs in an on-line fashion, with event boundaries marked by surges in attention that are modulated based on whether a boundary marks a fine, intermediate, or coarse unit. We also describe a method by which objective changes in an actors movement can be measured and analyzed as a predictor of participants segmentation behaviors.

Participants viewed videos of familiar body movements enacted by the android Repliee Q2, the human after whom it was modeled, and the skinned version of Q2 revealing its mechanical parts. We used a neural adaptation (repetition suppression) analysis to reveal brain areas sensitive to body movements, and explored whether the identity of the perceived agents modulated these responses. We found significantly higher activity in a distributed network of brain areas for the android, most notably in anterior intraparietal cortex. The responses for the human and the robot with the mechanical appearance resembled each other. We interpret these results within the framework of predictive coding and suggest that the uncanny valley phenomenon may have its roots in processing conflicts within the brains action perception system.",>Ayse Pinar Saygin>Thierry  Chaminade>Hiroshi Ishiguro,">University of California, San Diego>Aix-Marseille University CNRS>Osaka University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0648/index.html

The theory postulates an important role for cognitive disequilibrium, a state that occurs when learners face obstacles to goals, contradictions, incongruities, anomalies, uncertainty, and salient contrasts. The major hypotheses of the theory were supported in two studies in which participants completed a tutoring session with a computer tutor after which they provide judgments on their cognitive-affective states via a retrospective judgment protocol. Hidden Markov Models constructed from time series of learners cognitive-affective states confirmed the major predictions as well as suggested refinements for the theory of cognitive disequilibrium during deep learning.",>Sidney D'Mello>Art Graesser,>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0649/index.html

Whereas DI students relied only on the canonical formulation of variance taught to them, PF students generated a diversity of representations and formulations for variance but were ultimately unsuccessful in developing the canonical formulation. On the posttest however, PF students performed on par with DI students on procedural fluency, and significantly outperformed them on data analysis, conceptual insight, and transfer items. These results challenge the claim that there is little efficacy in having learners solve problems targeting concepts that are novel to them, and that direct instruction alone is the most effective approach for teaching novel concepts to learners.",>Manu Kapur,">National Institute of Education, Singapore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0650/index.html

We conducted an experiment in which three groups of subjects did different tasks before a target matching to sample task was introduced which contrasted a relationally versus an attributionally similar alternative. Subjects in one condition were asked to solve tasks involving relational reasoning while subjects in another condition were asked to tasks involving only attributes. As expected subjects in the first condition were more likely to pick up the relationally similar alternative while in the second condition the results reversed relative to a control group. In conclusion we argue that this study shows that encoding of relations can be a subject to unconscious context influence.",>Svetoslav Bliznashki>Boicho Kokinov,>New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0653/index.html

Less evidence refers to the other facets of executive control (EC), especially to the goal-directed selection of relational information. In this study, the load on two above mentioned EC functions and on WM capacity was manipulated in a single picture mapping task. Next to replicating the previous findings on the importance of dealing with distracter interference within WM, the current results demonstrate that the efficiency of relational mapping also depends on the goal-directed search for WM input, and that these two EC functions may be dissociable in mapping. Moreover, it was found that the impact of distraction can be linked to whether relations, in which distracters occur, have not exceeded WM capacity.",>Anna Chuderska,">Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0654/index.html
2010,Selective Attention by Structural Alignment: An Eyetracking Study,"A potential determinant of peoples selective attention is offered by the structural-alignment view of comparison. This view holds that objects are compared via structured representations that align sets of features that share relational roles. A central claim of this account is that the comparison process directs attention towards alignable features. This prediction has been supported by offline measures by Markman and Gentner (1997), who showed that alignable features serve as better cues for recall than nonalignable features. The present study provides the first online test of the structure-alignment theorys claim that alignability drives selective attention. Consistent with this, we show that in addition to serving as better cues for recall, alignable differences are attended more than nonalignable differences. Within-trial attention dynamics revealed that attention to alignable differences¬¬¬¬ increases over the course of the comparison process.",>Aaron Hoffman>Bradley Love>Arthur Markman,>University of Texas>University of Texas>University of Texas,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0655/index.html

Among the most important issues that call for anthropological expertise is the question of cognitive and/or linguistic universals (Evans & Levinson, 2009; Henrich, Heine & Norenzayan, in press; Norenzayan & Heine, 2005).

2010,Semantic network connectivity is related to vocabulary growth rate in children,"Adult semantic networks show small-world structural properties that are believed to support language processing and word retrieval. The focus of this paper is to understand when these properties emerge in lexical development. We believe that they relate to the rate of word acquisition and vocabulary size. To address this, we examine the connectivity patterns of semantic networks of individual children and compare children on faster and slower vocabulary growth trajectories. The results show that small-world properties emerge early. However, children on slower growth trajectories, who are at risk for significant language delay, do not show these properties. The differences between typical and these so-called late-talkers persist, even when vocabulary size is equated. Late talkers vocabularies are not only acquired later, but also less cohesively, a fact that may relate to future language processing difficulties for these children. In brief, the results suggest that properties of network connectivity may play a role in early lexical development.

2010,Effects of Maternal Input on Language in the Absence of Genetic Confounds: Vocabulary Development in Internationally Adopted Children,"Parents provide children with both genes (nature) and linguistic input (nurture). A growing body of research demonstrates that individual differences in childrens language are correlated with differences in parental speech. Although this suggests a causal link between parental input and the pace of language development, these correlations could reflect effects of shared genes on language, rather than a causal link between input and outcome. We explored effects of maternal input on English vocabulary development in internationally-adopted (IA) childrena population with no genetic confound. IA preschoolers demonstrated some of the same correlations with input as in previous studies; specifically, measures of input quality were significantly correlated with vocabulary. However, IA infants did not demonstrate this pattern. Differences between the age groups may be related to the pace of acquisition; more rapid vocabulary development in the preschoolers suggests that access to, and childrens ability to make use of input, may be a limiting factor for the infants.",>Carissa L.

Observers were shown masked presentations of randomly-placed discs on a screen and were required to mark the perceived locations of these discs on a subsequent blank screen. This provided a measure of recall for object locations and an indirect measure of display numerosity. Observers were tested on three stimulus durations (50, 200, 350 ms) and eight numerosities (2-9). Enumeration performance was high for displays containing up to six discsa higher subitizing range than reported in previous studies. Error in the location data was measured as the distance between corresponding stimulus and response discs. Overall, location errors increased in magnitude with larger numerosities and shorter display durations. When errors were computed as disc distance from display centroid, results suggest a compressed representation by observers. Additionally, enumeration and localization accuracy increased with display regularity.",>Harry Haladjian>Manish Singh>Zenon Pylyshyn>Randy Gallistel,>Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science>Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science>Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science>Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0662/index.html

Preverbal discriminations are approximate, however, and similarly limited by ratio across these dimensions. Here, we present the first evidence that redundant quantitative unisensory informationnamely, simultaneous visual cues to both number and sizeaccelerates six-month-olds quantitative competence. Using a habituation-dishabituation paradigm, results demonstrate that, when provided with synchronous visual cues to different quantitative properties, infants make more precise discriminations than when they receive information about a single cue alone. Such redundant conceptual information may be more salient than non-redundant information, which could better recruit attention and result in more precise learning and remembering than when such information is presented through only one cue.",>Joseph Baker>Jessica Feigleson>Kerry Jordan,>Utah State University>Utah State University>Utah State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0663/index.html

Recent studies have shown that this limit might be extended if participants are given sufficient opportunity to practice. An alternative explanation is that the stimuli used  which vary on only one physical dimension  may elicit psychological representations that vary on two (or more) dimensions. Participants may learn to take advantage of this characteristic during practice, thus improving performance. We use multi-dimensional scaling to examine this question, and conclude that despite some evidence towards the existence of two dimensions, a one dimensional account cannot be excluded.",>Pennie Dodds>Chris Donkin>Scott Brown>Andrew Heathcote,>University of Newcastle>Indiana University>University of Newcastle>University of Newcastle,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0664/index.html
2010,Mind Reading by Machine Learning: A Doubly Bayesian Method for Inferring Mental Representations,"A central challenge in cognitive science is to measure and quantify the mental representations humans develop - in other words, to 'read' subject's minds. In order to eliminate potential biases in reporting mental contents due to verbal elaboration, subjects' responses in experiments are often limited to binary decisions or discrete choices that do not require conscious reflection upon their mental contents. However, it is unclear what such impoverished data can tell us about the potential richness and dynamics of subjects' mental representations. To address this problem, we used ideal observer models that formalise choice behaviour as (quasi-)Bayes-optimal, given subjects' representations in long-term memory, acquired through prior learning, and the stimuli currently available to them. Bayesian inversion of such ideal observer models allowed us to infer subjects' mental representation from their choice behaviour in a variety of psychophysical tasks. The inferred mental representations also allowed us to predict future choices of subjects with reasonable accuracy, even in tasks that were different from those in which the representations were estimated. These results demonstrate a significant potential in standard binary decision tasks to recover detailed information about subjects' mental representations.",>Ferenc Huszar>Uta Noppeney>Mate Lengyel,">Computational and Biological Learning Lab, University of Cambridge>MPI Tuebingen>Computational and Biological Learning Lab, University of Cambridge",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0665/index.html

Three to 9 year old children visualized cross-sections of either real 3D geometric shapes (Experiment 1) or 2D photographs of the shapes (Experiment 2). Performance on the 3D task was also analyzed to determine to what extent cross-sectioning ability is related to performance on more widely used spatial tasks including mental rotation and the water-level task. We found that performance on the cross-sectioning and mental rotation tasks were significantly correlated, and the 2D and 3D tasks were both successful in assessing cross-sectioning ability in young children.

So far, the investigation of gist extraction has been limited to pictures of scenes. The present study investigated whether the gist in pictures of causal systems, which are typically used as instructional material, is extracted as fast as the gist in pictures of scenes, and whether more than just the gist is rapidly extracted from a causal system (i.e., information concerning its details and functioning). Schematic and photorealistic pictures of scenes and causal systems were presented to subjects (N = 24) at different presentation times. Results showed that the gist in causal systems is extracted as fast as in scenes, and that an initial understanding of the functioning of schematic causal systems is also rapidly acquired.

Seventy-four students were randomly assigned to six groups, resulting from a 2×2×2 mixed design, with spatial secondary task (with vs. without), text contents (visual vs. spatial), and text modality (spoken vs. written) as independent variables.

Also, cognitive models of web-navigation (like CoLiDeS, CoLiDeS+) ignore the information from visual modality and focus solely on the information from text. We conducted an experiment to study the extent to which providing icons next to hyperlinks facilitates information retrieval tasks on the web. Three different versions of navigation styles were created: Hyperlinks with Icons, Hyperlinks alone and Icons alone. Users took significantly less time, were significantly less disoriented and made fewer clicks to finish their tasks when icons were provided along with hyperlink text. These results suggest that it is important for a cognitive model on web-navigation to include information from pictures. An important practical implication is to provide meaningful icons next to hyperlinks for better navigation.",>Saraschandra Karanam>Janhavi Viswanathan>Anand  Theertha>Bipin Indurkhya>Herre van Oostendorp,">International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad>Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology, Hyderabad>Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology, Hyderabad>International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad>Utrecht University, Utrecht",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0669/index.html

2010,Is it me or the world? 16-month-olds distinguish competing hypotheses about the cause of failed interventions,"When an agent fails to make an object function properly, there are two possibilities: the agent did something wrong or something is wrong with the object. As in all problems of confounding, these hypotheses can be disambiguated by varying one factor and holding the other constant: in this case, either by holding the object constant and varying the agent (e.g., by asking for help from others) or by holding the agent constant and varying the object (e.g., by trying another object). Here we show that 16-month-old infants engage in distinct patterns of behavior depending on the relative probability of the competing hypotheses: they ask for help more often when they (rather than the object) are the probable cause of failure; they reach for a new object more often when the object (rather than themselves) is the probable cause of failure.",>Hyowon Gweon>Laura Schulz,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0671/index.html

2010,Children's Imitation of Action Sequences is Influenced by Statistical Evidence and Inferred Causal Structure,"Children are ubiquitous imitators, but how do they decide which actions to imitate? One possibility is that children might learn which actions are necessary to reproduce by observing the contingencies between action sequences and outcomes across repeated observations. We deﬁne a Bayesian model that predicts that children will decide whether to imitate part or all of a sequence based on the pattern of statistical evidence. To test this prediction, we conducted an experiment in which preschool children watched an experimenter repeatedly perform sequences of varying actions followed by an outcome. Childrens imitation of sequences that produced the outcome increased, in some cases resulting in production of shorter sequences of actions that the children had never seen performed in isolation. This behavior is consistent with our models predictions, and suggests that children attend to statistical evidence in deciding which actions to imitate, rather than obligately imitating successful actions.",>Daphna Buchsbaum>Alison Gopnik>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0673/index.html
2010,Thinking with the Body,"To explore the question of physical thinking  using the body as an instrument of cognition  we collected extensive video and interview data on the creative process of a noted choreographer and his company as they made a new dance. A striking case of physical thinking is found in the phenomenon of marking. Marking refers to dancing a phrase in a less than complete manner. Dancers mark to save energy. But they also mark to explore the tempo of a phrase, or its movement sequence, or the intention behind it. Because of its representational nature, marking can serve as a vehicle for thought. Importantly, this vehicle is less complex than the version of the same phrase danced full-out. After providing evidence for distinguishing different types of marking, three ways of understanding marking as a form of thought are considered: marking as a gestural language for encoding aspects of a target movement, marking as a method of priming neural systems involved in the target movement, and marking as a method for improving the precision of mentally projecting aspects of the target.",>David Kirsh,">University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0674/index.html
2010,The More the Merrier? Examining Three Interaction Hypothese,"While high interactivity is one of the key characteristics of one-on-one human tutoring, a great deal of controversy surrounds the issue of whether interactivity is indeed the key feature of tutorial dialogue that impacts students' learning. In this paper we investigate three interaction hypotheses: a widely-believed monotonic interactivity hypothesis, a better supported interaction plateau hypothesis, and our tactical interaction hypothesis. The monotonic interaction hypothesis predicts that increasing interactivity causes an increase in learning; the plateau hypothesis states that increasing interactivity yields increasing learning until it hits a plateau, and further increases in interactivity do not cause noticeable increases in learning. Finally, the tactical interaction hypothesis predicts that interactivity only increases learning when interactions are guided by effective tutorial tactics. In this paper, we examine each hypothesis in the context of an empirical study, the results of which support the tactical interaction hypothesis.",>Min Chi>Kurt VanLehn>Diane Litman,>Carnegie Mellon University>Arizona State University>University of Pittsburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0675/index.html
2010,Comparing Worked Examples and Tutored Problem Solving: Pure vs. Mixed Approaches,"This paper extends our previous work (Kim, Weitz, Heffernan & Krach, 2009) which compared a classic worked examples (WE) condition with a tutored problem solving (TPS) condition. By classic we mean the WE condition does not include tutoring, a self-explanation component, or fading. The aim of the current study was to compare the WE and TPS conditions with a mixed condition, which presents students with WE-TPS pairs. More specifically, for conceptual problems a pure WE condition was compared with a WE-TPS condition and for procedural problems a pure TPS condition was compared with a WE-TPS condition. While overall learning occurred in all conditions no significant differences were found between conditions. Further, our findings echo the results of earlier studies, that students who receive worked examples learn more efficiently  that is, they need significantly less time to complete the same learning material. This is an important finding for educators because building classic worked examples is considerably easier than building tutoring.",>Rob Weitz>Ron Salden>Ryung Kim>Neil Heffernan,>Seton Hall University>Carnegie Mellon University>Albert Einstein College of Medicine>Worcester Polytech Institute,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0676/index.html
2010,Interleaving Worked Examples and Cognitive Tutor Support for Algebraic Modeling of Problem Situations,"Integrating worked examples with problem solving yields more effective and efficient learning, as does intelligent tutoring support for problem solving. This study examines the impact of integrating worked examples and intelligent tutor support for algebra modeling problems. Students in three conditions alternately studied worked examples (either static graphics, interactive graphics or static tables) and solved Algebra Cognitive Tutor problems. A control group solved all the problems with the Cognitive Tutor. Students in the four groups developed equivalent problem-solving skills, but students learned more efficiently in the interleaved worked example conditions, requiring 26% less time to complete the problem set. There were no differences among the four groups in two measures of robust learning  a retention test and a transfer test. But students in the static table condition could more accurately describe what algebraic model components represent in problem situations than could students in the other three conditions.",>Albert Corbett>Stephen Reed>Bob Hoffman>Ben MacLaren>Angela Wagner,">Carnegie Mellon University>San Diego State University>San Diego State University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University, , ",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0677/index.html
2010,Learning during Intelligent Tutoring: When Do Integrated Visual-Verbal Representations Improve Student Outcomes?,"Research has shown that integration of visual and verbal information sources during learning promotes successful student outcomes. However, it is unclear whether it is better to provide students with integrated visual-verbal representations, or to require them to build such integrated representations themselves. In a classroom study, three conditions were used to explore the impact of integrated visual-verbal representations that emphasized rule-diagram mappings in geometry. Students viewed highlighted rule-diagram mappings during learning, generated these mappings themselves, or saw only numerical information embedded in diagrams (control). Students problem-solving knowledge was measured at posttest and delayed posttest. Overall, students who generated rule-diagram mappings during intelligent tutoring demonstrated better long-term understanding of geometry principles, but effects were only visible at delayed posttest. Results show that integrated visual-verbal representations best support deep learning when they help the learner make connections between features of a visual representation and relevant domain information, and student interactions can be an effective method to scaffold these connections.",>Kirsten Butcher>Vincent Aleven,>University of Utah>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0678/index.html
2010,Explanatory Reasoning for Inductive Confidence,"We present Explanatory Reasoning for Inductive Confidence (ERIC), a computational model of explanation generation and evaluation. ERIC combines analogical hypothesis generation and justification with normative probabilistic theory over statement confidences. It successfully captures a broad range of empirical phenomena, and represents a promising approach toward the application of explanatory knowledge in new situations.",>David Landy>John Hummel,>University of Richmond>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0679/index.html
2010,Explanations make inconsistencies harder to detect,"What role do explanations play in reasoning about inconsistencies? We postulate that when people create explanations, they use them to resolve conflicting information. This hypothesis predicts that inconsistencies should be harder to detect once individuals have in mind an explanation of the inconsistency. We report four experiments that tested this prediction. Experiments 1a and 1b corroborated the effect when participants made inferences from inconsistent assertions. Experiment 2 compared the effect of explanations of inconsistencies with those of a similarly demanding task. Experiment 3 ruled out a potential confound.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Phil Johnson-Laird,>Princeton University>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0680/index.html
2010,Why Does Explaining Help Learning? Insight From an Explanation Impairment Effect.,"Engaging in explanation, even to oneself, can enhance learning. What underlies this effect? Williams & Lombrozo (in press) propose that explanation exerts subsumptive constraints on processing, driving learners to discover underlying patterns. A category-learning experiment demonstrates that explanation can enhance or impair learning depending on whether these constraints match the structure of the material being learned. Explaining can help learning when reliable patterns are present, but actually impairs learning when patterns are misleading. This explanation impairment effect is predicted by the subsumptive constraints account, but challenges alternative hypotheses according to which explaining helps learning by increasing task engagement through motivation, attention, or processing time. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications for learning and education.",>Joseph Jay Williams>Tania Lombrozo>Bob Rehder,>University of California Berkeley>University of California Berkeley>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0681/index.html
2010,"Explanation Constrains Learning, and Prior Knowledge Constrains Explanation","A great deal of research has demonstrated that learning is influenced by the learners prior background knowledge (e.g. Murphy, 2002; Keil, 1990), but little is known about the processes by which prior knowledge is deployed. We explore the role of explanation in deploying prior knowledge by examining the joint effects of eliciting explanations and providing prior knowledge in a task where each should aid learning. Three hypotheses are considered: that explanation and prior knowledge have independent and additive effects on learning, that their joint effects on learning are subadditive, and that their effects are superadditive. A category learning experiment finds evidence for a superadditive effect: explaining drives the discovery of regularities, while prior knowledge constrains which regularities learners discover. This is consistent with an account of explanations effects on learning proposed in Williams & Lombrozo (in press).",>Joseph Jay Williams>Tania Lombrozo,>University of California Berkeley>University of California Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0682/index.html
2010,Flux: Fundamental or Frivolous?,"A broad range of findings across the cognitive sciences has emerged revealing surprising flexibility and dynamic flux in a large range of cognitive domains. These include exciting new discoveries of neuroplasticity well into adulthood, discoveries of great cognitive variability as a function of the statistical properties of ones environment (from patterns in natural languages, to those in embodied experience), and discoveries of the surprisingly dynamic microstructure of cognition. Do such findings demonstrate that many fundamental aspects of cognition are indeed quite flexible? Or does finding that some aspect of cognition is flexible mean that it is therefore not fundamental? Or is flux the only truly fundamental thing about cognition in the first place? The talks in this symposium will speak to these questions from a variety of perspectives (incorporating ideas from development, neuroscience, computational insights, and cross-cultural approaches), and help us clarify our thinking about what such findings mean.",>lera boroditsky>helen neville>christina karns>arthur markman>michael  spivey,>stanford university>university of oregon>university of oregon>university of texas>university of california,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2010/papers/0683/index.html

2017,"Methods for Reconstructing Causal Networks from Observed Time-Series: Granger-Causality, Transfer Entropy, and Convergent Cross-Mapping","A major question that arises in many areas of Cognitive Science is the need to distinguish true causal connections between variables from mere correlations. The most common way of addressing this distinction is the design of well-controlled experiments. However, in many situations, it is extremely difficult --or even outright impossible-- to perform such experiments. Researchers are then forced to rely on correlational data in order to make causal inferences. This situation is especially common when one needs to analyze longitudinal data corresponding to historical time-series, symbolic sequences, or developmental data. These inferences are problematic. From the correlations alone it is difficult to determine the direction of the causal arrow linking two variables. Worse even, the lack of controls of observational data entail that correlations found between two variables need not reflect any causal connection between them, as some third variable could be the actually driver for any two measured variables.",>Fermin Moscoso del Prado Martin,">University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0002/index.html
2017,Dynamic Field Theory: Conceptual Foundations and Applications in Cognitive and Developmental Science,"Dynamical Systems thinking has been influential in the way psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists think about sensori-motor behavior and its development. The initial emphasis on motor behavior was expanded when the concept of dynamic activation fields provided access to embodied cognition. Dynamical Field Theory offers a framework for thinking about representation-in-the-moment that is firmly grounded in both Dynamical Systems thinking and neurophysiology. Dynamic Neural Fields are formalizations of how neural populations represent the continuous dimensions that characterize perceptual features, movements, and cognitive decisions. Neural fields evolve dynamically under the influence of inputs as well as strong neuronal interaction, generating elementary forms of cognition through dynamical instabilities. The concepts of DFT establish links between brain and behavior, helping to define experimental paradigms in which behavioral signatures of specific neural mechanisms can be observed. These paradigms can be modeled with Dynamic Neural Fields, deriving testable predictions and providing quantitative accounts of behavior.",>John Spencer>Vanessa Simmering>Sebastian Schneegans,>University of East Anglia>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Cambridge,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0003/index.html
2017,The Fine Art of Conversation,"This workshop aims to give human interaction researchers the conceptual and practical apparatus to balance their representations of data (usually just drawings and photographs), so as to “maximally incite, but also constrain” their representations, as artists sometimes successfully achieve (Streeck, Grothues, & Villanueva, 2009, p.28). Why—as Streeck points out—are the drawings and visualisations of interaction researchers so halting and timid, compared to how artists have responded to the same representational problems? These heavily segmented, sparsely constructed representations of interaction suggest a prevailing positivistic outlook with regard to representing shared space, where interaction is presented as staggered and discrete physical events with little to connect them. The workshop seeks to redress this situation by examining the solutions that artists have arrived at when representing human interaction, and asking participants to engage in a series of activities and discussions which will re-frame their approaches to this issue.",>Saul Albert>Claude Heath>Patrick Healey,">Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts, USA>Royal Holloway, University of London>Queen Mary, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0004/index.html
2017,Workshop: Bridging the Gap: Is Logic and Automated Reasoning a Foundation for Human Reasoning?,"Reasoning is a core ability in human cognition.

2017,"Citizen Science, Gamification, and Virtual Reality for Cognitive Research","This workshop discusses three topics. The first topic is citizen science which involves volunteers all around the world generating data to address scientific problems, and recently led to breakthroughs in the natural sciences. Citizen science typically involves volunteers playing online games while unknowingly solving real scientific problems. Although citizen science data cannot offer meximum experimental control, the citizen science samples are usually very diverse. Our second topic is gamification which means adding game-like features to a task. Gamified tasks are typically motivating for participants. While citizen science often uses gamification, laboratory studies can also benefit from being gamified. Our third topic is virtual reality, a technology from the gaming industry enabling players to experience a environment in 3D, as if they were in the middle of it. This typically causes subjective immersion by simulating a naturalistic experience of interacting with the world, while simultaneously offering control about the events.",>Jana Jarecki>Jacob Sherson>Juho Hamari>Julia A.

2017,The Computational Foundations of Religious Cognition: A Workshop Hosted by the International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion (IACSR),"Religion is of global significance, and its study requires explanations from cognitive science. Currently, the cognitive science of religion consists of researchers working in an array of disciplines, employing diverse methods, including, among others: experimental research and modelling in psychology and neuroscience, and historical, archaeological, and comparative studies of religious cognition in anthropology and religious studies. The International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion (IACSR) seeks to advance the naturalistic and cognitive study of religion by providing settings for productive dialogue across disciplinary boundaries and methodological approaches. This half-day workshop, organized by the IACSR, has three complementary goals: 1) to expose attendees to diverse methodologies for studying the computational foundations of religious cognition, 2) to provide a forum for researchers to present recent empirical findings that bear on our understanding of religious cognition, and 3) to foster new research collaborations.",>Ann Taves>Dimitris Xygalatas>John Shaver,>University of California Santa Barbara>University of Connecticut>University of Otago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0009/index.html

These architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and many variants and extensions. Computational cognitive scientists and neuroscientists have now begun to explore these techniques, and how they might combine with other computational tools such as Bayesian models, symbolic grammars and rule-systems, probabilistic programs, and reinforcement learning. The goal of this workshop is to bring together some of the leading researchers working at this interface, for short talks and an integrative discussion of open questions and promising directions.",>Ilker Yildirim>Josh Tenenbaum,>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0010/index.html
2017,Anthropological Contributions to Cognitive Science,"Anthropology was a founding member of cognitive science (Bender et al., 2010; Gardner, 1985), sharing with other cognitive disciplines a deep interest in thinking and behavior. With its unique expertise in the cultural content, context, and constitution of cognition, it would still be essential to any comprehensive endeavor to explore the human mind (Bloch, 2012), but rather has turned into cognitive science’s “missing discipline” (Boden, 2006), thus leaving important questions unanswered or even unasked. Given that substantial shares of knowledge are implicit and that cognition is situated, distributed, embodied, and grounded in various other ways, anthropological approaches provide privileged access to investigation: for arriving at reasonable hypotheses, ensuring ecological validity, and even for coming up with new research questions and paradigms (Astuti & Bloch, 2012; Hutchins, 2010; Nersessian, 2006).",>Andrea Bender>Sieghard Beller>Rita Astuti>Olivier Le Guen>Karenleigh Overmann>Peter Rácz>Fiona Jordan>Mads Solberg,">University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway>University of Bergen, Norway>LSE, UK>CIESAS, Mexico>University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States>U Bristol, UK>U Bristol, UK>University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0011/index.html
2017,"Static and dynamic visual narratives, by brain and by eye","Narrative has been studied for millennia, though recent attention in the cognitive sciences has turned towards visual narratives like those found in comics (Cohn, 2013a) and films (Zacks, 2014). Most agree that the basic principles guiding comprehension involve principles that extend across the verbal and visual domains (Cohn, 2013b; Gernsbacher, 1990; Magliano & Zacks, 2011). However, visual units of narrative—both drawn and moving—demand different affordances to retrieve and integrate information. [...] This symposium highlights this growing field within the cognitive sciences. First, the presentations focus on visual narratives of both types: static, drawn narratives, and dynamic, moving ones. Second, they split their focus between eye-tracking and cognitive neuroscience. Together, these presentations will highlight the relevance of visual narratives for studying many facets of cognition, including attention, events, narrative, and discourse.",>Neil Cohn>Tom Foulsham>Tim Smith>Jeff Zacks,">Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands>University of Essex>Birkbeck, University of London>Washington University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0012/index.html

2017,Educating Spatial Thinking for STEM Success,"In recent years there has been new recognition of the importance of spatial thinking in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, in part because of evidence that spatial ability predicts success and persistence in STEM (Wai, Lubinski & Benbow, 2009), but is not fostered in our educational systems (National Research Council, 2006). Based on this evidence, current approaches aim to increase science achievement by training the types of general spatial skills measured by spatial ability tests. However, although there is considerable evidence that these spatial skills can be trained (Uttal, et al., 2013), there has been little evidence to date that training of general spatial skills transfers to success in STEM disciplines (Stieff & Uttal, 2015).",>Mary Hegarty>David Uttal>Mike Stieff>Tom Lowrie>Stella Vosniadou,">University of California, Santa Barbara>Northwestern University>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Canberra>Flinders University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0014/index.html
2017,Symposium on Problem Solving and Goal-Directed Sequential Activity,"Problem solving is one of the hallmarks of human cognition. This term covers a wide range of behaviors, including abilities for solving unfamiliar puzzles, designing new artifacts, generating extended plans, and pursuing complex routine activities. They can involve reasoning, subgoaling, recognizing alternatives, evaluating them, and guiding search through large spaces. The study of problem solving played a crucial role in the early development of cognitive science as a field. Research on this topic revealed basic insights about the representations and processes that underlie high-level cognition. However, in recent years work on this topic has been poorly represented at the annual Cognitive Science meeting. Research has continued and advances have occurred, but have been reported mainly in other venues. This symposium aims to address that situation. We have recruited participants with impressive track records in different aspects of problem solving. Together, they will cover a variety of phenomena and computational perspectives.",>Pat Langley>Richard Cooper,">ISLE, Palo Alto, California, United States>Birkbeck, University of London, London, England, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0015/index.html

LUCID trains scientists from computational and behavioral disciplines to advance basic and applied research in domains where machines are used to instruct, predict, understand, respond to or learn from human users. Such human-machine interactions have a remarkably broad range of application—in public and private education across the lifespan, industry and information technology, public and private health management, social networking and communication, robotics and human-computer interaction, national security, public policy, and, of course, basic research into the nature of learning, cognition, and intelligent behavior.",>Timothy Rogers>Charles Kalish,">Psychology, University of Wisconsin-Madison>Educational Psychology, University of Wisconsin-Madison",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0016/index.html
2017,Intuitive Biology and Global Challenges: Applying Theoretical Insights for Public Good,"Questions about science literacy and the rejection of scientific consensus are once again in the spotlight, with freshly-ignited debate over the facts of climate change and the teaching of evolution. In recent years, cognitive science research has highlighted the range of cognitive, motivational and emotional factors that contribute to science acceptance. We focus on a specific strand of this research, related to the concepts and intuitions deployed in reasoning about the biological world. Our core aims are two-fold: to advance key theoretical debates via the presentation of new empirical data, and to highlight emerging best-practice in translating this basic research into applied tools in both formal learning and informal communication contexts. A defining feature of our symposium is the inclusion of nascent research programs exploring the role of biological reasoning in newly-emerging domains of public debate (e.g. synthetic biology), alongside more established research areas (e.g. climate change & evolutionary theory).",>Lauren Swiney>Deborah Kelemen>Andrew Shtulman>John Coley>Nicole Betz>Stefaan Blancke,">University of Warwick>Boston University>Occidental College>Northeastern University, Boston>Northeastern University, Boston>Ghent University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0017/index.html
2017,Time in the mind of a child: Perspectives on the development of temporal cognition,"The ways in which we experience and reason about time are fundamental aspects of human cognition. Both philosophers and cognitive scientists have struggled to explain the origins of our multifaceted, abstract concept of time. One means of exploring the nature of time in the adult mind is by asking how the ability to mentally represent and reason about time develops in children. Although some aspects of temporal cognition, like low-level duration perception, are present at birth, others, like using a clock, take up to a decade to learn. By tracking how different time-related cognitive phenomena emerge and change across development, we may gain a fuller picture of how the many facets of time interrelate, including the biological and cultural factors that underlie them. This symposium brings together researchers from around the world to discuss five different aspects of children’s temporal cognition, each of which change dramatically during the preschool years.",>Katharine Tillman>Florie Monier>Meng Zhang>Jonathan Redshaw>Teresa McCormack,">University of California, San Diego, USA>Université Clermont Auvergne, France>Rutgers University, USA>University of Queensland, Australia>Queens University Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0018/index.html
2017,Big Data and Little Learners,"Recent advances in the data sciences, particularly within the area of language technology, have been impressive and non-incremental. For example, within the domain of language translation, the application of deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to large bodies of text have resulted in a 60% reduction in translation errors from traditional methods, significantly closing the gap between machine and human performance (Wu et al., 2016). Similarly impressive advances have been observed in, e.g., speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012), syntactic parsing (Dyer et al., 2015) and automatic content extraction (Berant et al., 2015). Clearly, excitement is justified as a new era of linguistic technology is emerging.

2017,Burstiness across multimodal human interaction reveals differences between verbal and non-verbal communication,"Recent studies of naturalistic face-to-face communication have demonstrated temporal coordination patterns such as the synchronization of verbal and non-verbal behavior, which provides evidence for the proposal that verbal and non-verbal communicative control derives from one system. In this study, we argue that the observed relationship between verbal and non-verbal behaviors depends on the level of analysis. In a re-analysis of a corpus of naturalistic multimodal communication (Louwerse et al., 2012), we focus on measuring the temporal patterns of specific communicative behaviors in terms of their burstiness. We examined burstiness estimates across different roles of the speaker and different communicative channels. We observed more burstiness for verbal versus non-verbal channels, and for more versus less informative language sub-channels. These findings demonstrate a new method for analyzing temporal patterns in communicative behaviors, and they suggest a more complex relationship between verbal and non-verbal channels than suggested by prior studies.",>Drew Abney>Rick Dale>Chris Kello>Max Louwerse,">Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA>University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced>Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0020/index.html
2017,Enactive Mechanistic Explanation of Social Cognition,"In this paper we examine an enactive approach to social cognition, a species of radical embodied cognition typically proposed as an alternative to traditional cognitive science. According to enactivists, social cognition is best explained by reference to the social unit rather than the individuals that participate in it. We identify a methodological problem in this approach, namely a lack of clarity with respect to the model of explanation it adopts. We review two complaints about a mechanistic explanatory framework, popular in traditional cognitive science, that prevent enactivists from embracing it. We argue that these complaints are unfounded and propose a conceptual model of enactive mechanistic explanation of social cognition.",>Ekaterina Abramova>Marc Slors>Iris van Rooij,">Radboud University Nijmegen; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen>Radboud University Nijmegen; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0021/index.html
2017,Human Visual Search as a Deep Reinforcement Learning Solution to a POMDP,When people search for a target in a novel image they often make use of eye movements to bring the relatively high acuity fovea to bear on areas of interest. The strategies that control these eye movements for visual search have been of substantial scientific interest. In the current article we report a new computational model that shows how strategies for visual search are an emergent consequence of perceptual/motor constraints and approximately optimal strategies. The model solves a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) using deep Q-learning to acquire strategies that optimise the trade-off between speed and accuracy.

2017,Executive function and attention predict low-income preschoolers' active category learning,"Recent studies find that school-age children learn better when they have active control during study. Yet little is known about how individual differences in strategy or cognitive control skills may affect active learning for preschoolers, nor if experimental measures of active learning map onto real-world learning outcomes. The current study assesses 101 low-income 5-year-olds on an active category learning task, and measures of executive function, attention, and school readiness. We find that preschoolers use an informative sampling strategy for categories defined by stimuli features in 1D and when presented with a distractor dimension (2D). Children accurately classify in 1D, but show mixed performance in 2D. Attention predicts sampling accuracy, and working memory and inhibitory control predict classification accuracy. Performance in the active learning task predicts early math and pre-literacy skills. These findings suggest that trial-by-trial learning decisions may reveal insight into how cognitive control skills support the acquisition of knowledge.",>Katherine A.

2017,Simulating behavioural interventions for developmental deficits: When improving strengths produces better outcomes than remediating weaknesses,"Computational models of cognitive development have been frequently used to model impairments found in developmental disorders but relatively rarely to simulate behavioural interventions to remediate these impairments. One area of controversy in practices of intervention is whether it is better to attempt to remediate an area of weakness or to build on the child’s strengths. We present an artificial neural network model of productive vocabulary development simulating children with word-finding difficulties. We contrast an intervention to remediate weakness (additional practice on naming) with interventions to improve strengths (improving phonological and semantic knowledge). Remediating weakness served to propel the system more quickly along the same atypical trajectory, while improving strengths produced long-term increases in final vocabulary size. A combination yielded the best outcome. The model represents the first mechanistic demonstration of how interventions targeting strengths may serve to improve behavioural outcomes in developmental disorders.",>Hala Alireza>Anna Fedor>Michael Thomas,">Developmental Neurocognition Lab, Birkbeck, University of London>2MTA-ELTE Theoretical Biology and Evolutionary Ecology Research Group, Budapest>Developmental Neurocognition Lab, Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0024/index.html
2017,A Bayesian Model of Memory for Text,"The study of memory for texts has had an long tradition of research in psychology. According to most general accounts of text memory, the recognition or recall of items in a text is based on querying a memory representation that is built up on the basis of background knowledge. The objective of this paper is to describe and test a Bayesian model of this general account. In particular, we develop a model that describes how we use our background knowledge to form memories as a process of Bayesian inference of the statistical patterns that are inherent in a text, followed by posterior predictive inference of the words that are typical of those inferred patterns. This provides us with precise predictions about what words will be remembered from any given text. We then test these predictions using data from a memory experiment using texts from a corpus of British English.",>Mark Andrews,>Nottingham Trent University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0025/index.html
2017,Numbers Uniquely Bias Spatial Attention: A Novel Paradigm for Understanding Spatial-Numerical Associations,"Over the past two-and-a-half decades, numerous empirical studies have demonstrated a relationship between numbers and space. A classic interpretation is that these spatial-numerical associations (SNAs) are a product of a stable mental number line (MNL) in the mind, yet others have argued that SNAs are a product of transient mappings that occur in working memory. Importantly, although the latter interpretation has no implications for the representation of number, the former suggests that the representation of number is inherently spatial. Here, we tease apart questions of spatial representation (à la an MNL perspective) and spatial strategy (à la alternative accounts). In a novel place-the-number task, we demonstrate that numbers automatically bias spatial attention whereas other ordinal sequences (i.e., letters) do not. We argue that this is evidence of an inherently spatial representation of number and explore how this work may help answer future questions about the relationship between space and number.",>Lauren Aulet>Sami Yousif>Stella Lourenco,>Emory University>Yale University>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0026/index.html
2017,Highly Proficient Bilinguals Maintain the Language-Specific Pragmatic Constraints on Pronouns: Evidence from Speech and Gesture,"In this paper, we study the two modalities of language, speech and gesture, and ask how they reveal cross-linguistic influence on the use of subject pronouns in bilingual narratives. We elicited narratives from heritage speakers of Turkish in the Netherlands, in both Turkish (pro-drop) and Dutch (non-pro-drop), as well as from monolingual control groups. The use of pronouns was not very common in monolingual Turkish and was constrained by pragmatic contexts, unlike in Dutch. Furthermore, Turkish pronouns were more likely to be accompanied by localized gestures than Dutch pronouns, presumably because pronouns in Turkish are pragmatically marked forms. We did not find cross-linguistic influence in bilingual speech or gesture patterns: Highly proficient heritage speakers maintain monolingual patterns of pragmatic constraints on the use of pronouns multimodally. We suggest that speech and gesture parallel each other also in bilingual production in language contact contexts.",>Zeynep Azar>Ad Backus>Aslı Özyürek,">Radboud University

2017,Rise and fall of conflicting intuitions during reasoning,"Recent dual process models proposed that the strength of competing intuitions determines reasoning performance. A key challenge at this point is to search for boundary conditions; identify cases in which the strength of different intuitions will be weaker/stronger. Therefore, we ran two studies with the two-response paradigm in which people are asked to give two answers to a given reasoning problem. We adopted base-rate problems in which base rate and stereotypic information can cue conflicting intuitions. By manipulating the information presentation order, we aimed to manipulate their saliency; and by that, indirectly the activation strength of the intuitions. Contrary to our expectation, we observed that the order manipulation had opposite effects in the initial and final response stages. We explain these results by taking into account that the strength of intuitions is not constant but changes over time; they have a peak, a growth, and a decay rate.",>Bence Bago>Wim De Neys,">Paris Descartes University, Paris, France>Paris Descartes University, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0028/index.html
2017,The Refugees' Dilemma: not all deontological moral choices are of the same kind,"The focus of the present work concerns the nature of deontological decisions. We test the hypothesis that it is possible to specify deontological moral choices based on an unemotional rule, norm or principle and that such moral choices can be distinguished from emotion-driven ones. Using a novel paradigm for moral choice that we call The Refugees’ Dilemma, we provide evidence for such a rule- based route to moral choice. We show that participants with high scores in a Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) were more likely to adopt utilitarian or rule-based responses, as opposed to emotional ones. We also found that rule-based respondents reported the highest average psychological distance, more so that even utilitarian respondents. These findings show how emotional and rule-based influences can be separated with the appropriate scenario and challenges the approach of assuming both influences can be combined into a single deontological route in dual-process models.",>Albert Barque-Duran>Emmanuel Pothos,">City, University of London, London, United Kingdom>City, University of London, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0029/index.html
2017,I know what you need to know: Children's developing theory of mind and pedagogical evidence selection,"Natural pedagogy emerges early in development (Knudsen & Liszkowski, 2012), but good teaching requires presenting evidence specific to learners' knowledge (Shafto, Goodman, & Griffiths, 2014). How might the development of Theory of Mind (ToM) relate to the ability to select pedagogical evidence? We present a training study in which we investigated the link between preschool-aged children's false-belief understanding and their ability to select evidence for teaching. Our results suggest that children with more advanced ToM abilities were better evidence selectors, even when controlling for effects of age and numerical conservation abilities. We also found that children who improved more in false-belief understanding from pre- to post-test performed better on the pedagogical tasks over the course of the training. Finally, we report tentative evidence for a link between the pedagogical training and improvements in ToM. Our findings suggest important connections between ToM and evidential reasoning in natural pedagogy in early childhood.",>Ilona Bass>Elizabeth Bonawitz>Patrick Shafto>Dhaya Ramarajan>Alison Gopnik>Henry Wellman,">Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark>Independent Scientist>University of California, Berkeley>University of Michigan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0030/index.html
2017,"Didn't know, or didn't show? Preschoolers consider epistemic state and degree of omission when evaluating teachers","The ability to recognize and evaluate reliable informants is a critical skill for effective social learning. Building on prior work showing children's sensitivity to informants who omit relevant information, here we asked whether children's teacher evaluations incorporate information about 1) the epistemic state of the teacher, and 2) the amount and value of information taught. Preschool-aged children rated informants who taught learners about a novel toy with four functions; we systematically varied the number and value of functions the teachers knew and taught. Our results indicate that children exonerated unintentional omissions of teachers who had incomplete knowledge, and provided graded ratings based on the degree of omission. These findings are consistent with the predictions of prior computational work, and suggest that the ability to reason about others' knowledge plays an important role in children's inferences about others' efficacy as informants.",>Ilona Bass>Elizabeth Bonawitz>Hyowon Gweon,>Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0031/index.html
2017,Modeling human categorization of natural images using deep feature representations,"Over the last few decades, cognitive scientists have developed sophisticated formal models of human categorization, and computer vision researchers have achieved increasingly impressive performance in natural image classification. In this paper, we combine the strengths of these approaches, using representations from a convolutional neural network to evaluate cognitive models of categorization against >300,000 human judgments of natural images. We find that a prototype model performs best overall, and that an exemplar model performs best when the network's most abstract features are used. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the optimal categorization strategy over a set of stimuli is deeply linked to how they are represented, suggesting that any satisfying characterization of categorization behavior over naturalistic stimuli must consider it the result of a dual process of feature learning and strategy selection.

We propose an automatic method for extracting crosslinguistic co-categorization patterns from parallel texts, and explore the properties of the data as a potential source for automatically creating semantic representations for cognitive modeling. We focus on indefinite pronouns, comparing our findings against a study based on secondary sources (Haspelmath 1997). We show that using automatic methods on parallel texts contributes to more cognitively-plausible semantic representations.",>Barend Beekhuizen>Julia Watson>Suzanne Stevenson,>University of Toronto>University of Toronto>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0033/index.html
2017,"How Relative is the Relative Frame of Reference? Front and back in Norwegian, Farsi, German, and Japanese","Across languages, people differ in which of the three basic frames of reference (FoRs) they prefer when describing spatial relations: absolute, intrinsic, or relative. But how much variation is there with regard to the relative FoR, which is anchored in the observer and occurs as one of three variants? Is the reflection variant canonical, as assumed by many scholars? And how are objects in a person’s back referred to: by turning towards the objects? Results from two studies, one with speakers of Norwegian and Farsi, the other with speakers of German and Japanese, reveal that reflection is not canonical, but that translation and even rotation are used as well. In addition, turning towards objects arranged in a person’s back is very rare; what people use instead is a backward projection strategy that goes without rotation.",>Sieghard Beller>Andrea Bender,">University of Bergen, Norway>University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0034/index.html
2017,Quantifying infants' statistical word segmentation: a meta-analysis,"Theories of language acquisition and perceptual learning increasingly rely on statistical learning mechanisms. The current meta-analysis aims to clarify the robustness of this capacity in infancy within the word segmentation literature. Our analysis reveals a significant, small effect size for conceptual replications of Saffran, Aslin, & Newport (1996), and a nonsignificant effect across all studies that incorporate transitional probabilities to segment words. In both conceptual replications and the broader literature, however, statistical learning is moderated by whether stimuli are naturally produced or synthesized. These findings invite deeper questions about the complex factors that influence statistical learning, and the role of statistical learning in language acquisition.",>Alexis Black>Christina Bergmann,">University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada>Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0035/index.html
2017,Narrowing of the Cone-of-Direct Gaze Through Reinforcement Learning,"We investigated whether reinforcement learning was able to account for the emergence of a CoD and its narrowing in childhood. To this end, we adapted Triesch et al.'s (2006) reinforcement learning by (1) defining an object topology over object locations, and (2) introducing opponent non-linear reward profiles for looking objects and caregivers. In Simulation 1 we show that these modifications give rise to a functional CoD in which there is reduced eye gaze following and increased fixation on the caregiver for locations with a small caregiver eye gaze eccentricity. In Simulation 2 we show that the width of this effect reduces with learning, suggesting that developmental decreases in the CoD may be driven by reinforcement learning. In Simulation 3 we explore how changes in model parameters can explain the CoD in high anxiety populations. Finally, the model provides one way of unifying the developmental gaze-following and CoD literature.",>Sam Blakeman>Denis Mareschal,>University College London>Birkbeck Univeristy of London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0036/index.html
2017,Functionally localized representations contain distributed information: insight from simulations of deep convolutional neural networks,"Preferential activation to faces in the brain’s fusiform gyrus has led to the proposed existence of a face module termed the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) (Kanwisher et. al, 1997). However, arguments for distributed, topographical object-form representations in FFA and across visual cortex have been proposed to explain data showing that FFA activation patterns contain decodable information about non-face categories (Haxby et. al, 2001; Hanson & Schmidt, 2011). Using two deep convolutional neural network models able to perform human-level object and facial recognition, respectively, we demonstrate that both localized category representations (LCRs) and high-level face-specific representations allow for similar decoding accuracy between non-preferred visual categories as between a preferred and non-preferred category. Our results suggest that neuroimaging of a cortical “module” optimized for face processing should yield significant decodable information for non-face categories so long as representations within the module are activated by non-face stimuli.",>Nicholas Blauch>Elissa Aminoff>Michael Tarr,">University of Massachusetts, Amherst>Fordham University>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0037/index.html
2017,Inferential Role Semantics for Natural Language,"Cognitive models have long been used to study linguistic phenomena spanning the domains of phonology, syntax, and semantics. Of these domains, semantics is unique in that there is little clarity concerning what a model ought to do to provide an account of how the meanings of complex linguistic expressions are understood. To address this problem, we introduce a neural model that is trained to generate sentences that follow from an input sentence. The model is trained using the Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset, and to evaluate its performance, we report entailment prediction accuracies on test sentences not present in the training data. We also report the results of a simple study that compares human plausibility ratings for both ground-truth and model-generated entailments for a random selection of test sentences. Taken together, these analyses indicate that the model accounts for important inferential relationships amongst linguistic expressions.",>Peter Blouw>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0038/index.html
2017,Split-Second Detection of Cooperativeness from Faces in the Trust Game,"Economic interactions often imply to gauge the trustworthiness of others. Recent studies showed that when making trust decisions in economic games, people have some accuracy in detecting trustworthiness from the facial features of unknown partners. Here we provide evidence that this face-based trustworthiness detection is a fast and intuitive process by testing its performance at split-second levels of exposure. Participants played a Trust game, in which they made decisions whether to trust another player based on their picture. In two studies, we manipulated the exposure time of the picture. We observed that trustworthiness detection remained better than chance for exposure times as short as 100 ms, although it disappeared with an exposure time of 33ms. We discuss implications for ongoing debates on the use of facial inferences for social and economic decisions.",>Jean-Francois Bonnefon>Astrid Hopfensitz>Wim De Neys,">University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France>University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France>Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0039/index.html

In Experiments 1 and 2, we found that increasing the diversity of a contrast set led people to infer that a target exemplar corresponded to a higher level category and led to greater generalization of a novel property associated with the target. Further, we demonstrated two boundary conditions in which the effect only occurred when the contrast set was consistent with a higher level category that both united the contrast exemplars and distinguished them from the target (Experiment 4) and when contrast and target shared an obvious parent category (Experiment 5). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that increasing the diversity of a contrast increases generalization from a target, but only if the contrast set is drawn from a single category that excludes, but shares a common parent with, the target.",>David Bosch>David Kalkstein>Tali Kleiman,>New York University>New York University>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0040/index.html

We bring them together for the first time in an experiment where participants learn causal structure by performing interventions in continuous time. We contrast learning in acyclic and cyclic devices, with reliable and unreliable cause-effect delays.

2017,Harmony in a non-harmonic language: word order learning in French children,"Recent studies using artificial language learning have argued that the cross-linguistic frequency of harmonic word order patterns–in which heads are ordered consistently before or after dependents across syntactic categories–reflects a cognitive bias (Culbertson, Smolensky, & Legendre, 2012; Culbertson & Newport, 2015a). These studies suggest that English speak- ing adults and children favor harmonic orders of nouns and different nominal modifiers (adjectives, numerals). However, because they target English learners, whose native language is harmonic in the nominal domain (Num-Adj-N), this preference may be based on transfer rather than a universal bias for harmony. We present new evidence from French-speaking children, whose native language is non-harmonic in this do- main (Num-N-Adj). Our results reveal clear effects of native language transfer, but also evidence that a harmonic pattern is favored even in this population of learners.",>Guillaume Braquet>Jennifer Culbertson,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0042/index.html
2017,How can I help? 24- to 48-month-olds provide help specific to the cause of others' failed actions,"When young children see others fail to achieve a goal, they spontaneously help. But there are many reasons why someone might fail, and consequently, many ways to help. In order to help effectively, we need to understand why someone is failing, so we can address the cause. One important distinction is whether the failure is due to the agent’s own actions or something external to her in the world. Here, we show that 24- to 48-month-olds can use their past experience to reason about the probable cause of another person’s failure and provide help appropriate for that cause. Children’s help targeted the world when their prior knowledge suggested that the source of failure was external to the agent, and targeted the person’s actions when this source appeared to be internal to the agent.",>Sophie Bridgers>Sara Altman>Hyowon Gweon,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA>Stanford University, Stanford, CA>Stanford University, Stanford, CA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0043/index.html
2017,Watching Non-Corresponding Gestures Helps Learners with High Visuospatial Ability to Learn about Movements with Dynamic Visualizations: An fNIRS Study,"This study investigates whether making and observing (human) gestures facilitates learning about non-human biological movements and whether correspondence between gesture and to-be-learned movement is superior to non-correspondence. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to address whether gestures activate the human mirror-neuron system (hMNS) and whether this activation mediates the facilitation of learning. During learning, participants viewed the animations of the to-be-learned movements twice. Depending on the condition, the second viewing was supplemented with either a self-gesturing instruction (Y/N) and/or a gesture video (corresponding/non-corresponding/no). Results showed that high-visuospatial-ability learners showed better learning outcomes with non-corresponding gestures, whereas those gestures were detrimental for low-visuospatial-ability learners. Furthermore, the activation of the inferior-parietal cortex (part of the hMNS) tended to predict better learning outcomes. Unexpectedly, making gestures did not influence learning, but cortical activation differed for learners who self-gestured depending on which gesture they observed.

This study investigated how the proximity of the hands to digital information in pop-ups influences learning outcomes on multi-touch devices. Depending on the distance between the information in the pop-ups and the hands of the users there were three conditions: (1) all pop-ups opened near the hands, (2) all pop-ups opened far from the hands, and (3) pop-ups with visuospatial information opened near the hands, whereas pop-ups with textual information opened far from the hands (mixed condition). Results showed better learning outcomes when visuospatial pop-ups are presented near the hands, whereas there was no difference in learning outcomes between near and far presented textual pop-ups.

2017,Maintenance of Perceptual Information in Speech Perception,"Acoustic and contextual cues to linguistic categories tend to be temporally distributed across the speech signal. Optimal cue integration thus requires maintenance of subcategorical information over time. At the same time, previous work suggests that finite sensory memory or processing capacity strongly limits how much subcategorical information can be maintained (or for how long). We argue that previous work might have over-interpreted the role of these limitations. In two perception experiments, we find no limit in the ability to maintain subcategorical information. We also find that maintenance seems to be the default, neither limited to perceptually particularly ambiguous signals, nor a learned strategy specific to our experiment. In contrast, listeners' decision for how long to delay categorization, we find, is a function of perceptual ambiguity. It is therefore crucial to distinguish between in-principle abilities (even when they reflect default processing), and decisions made within the bounds of those abilities.",>Wednesday Bushong>T.

This explains timing biases such as the range bias where a duration is reproduced as longer when previously encountered durations were longer than shorter. However, it is unclear whether prior belief is based on previously perceived or reproduced durations. In 4 experiments, we show that the range bias occurs between short and long reproduction ranges but not between short and long perception ranges. Further analyses also show that the prior is updated by the most recent reproduced (but not perceived) duration. Together these results support a task-oriented Bayesian inference account of time reproduction, where people use the perceived duration and their past reproduction experience to make an inference about how much time to reproduce.",>Zhenguang Cai>Ruiming Wang>Huihui Liu>Maarten Speekenbrink,">University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom>South China Normal University>South China Normal University>University College London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0048/index.html

In a series of experiments featuring naturalistic concepts (psychology concepts) and naïve learners, we extend previous research by showing that the sequence of study changes the representation the learner creates of the study materials. Interleaved study leads to the creation of relatively interrelated concepts that are represented by contrast to each other and based on discriminating properties. Blocked study, instead, leads to the creation of relatively isolated concepts that are represented in terms of their central and characteristic properties. The relative benefits of these representations depend on whether the test of conceptual knowledge requires contrastive or characteristic information. These results argue for the integrated investigation of the benefits of different sequences of study as depending on the characteristics of the study and testing situation as a whole.",>Paulo Carvalho>Rob Goldstone,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0049/index.html

Students beliefs, behaviors and learning outcomes.","Learning by doing refers to learning practices that involve completing activities as opposed to explicit learning (e.g., reading). Although the benefits of learning by doing have been described before, it is still relatively uncommon in instructional practice. We investigated how much students employ learning by doing in online courses, and whether it is associated with improved learning outcomes. Spending more time completing activities had a larger impact on learning outcomes than spending more time reading, even in the case of mostly declarative content, such as in a Psychology course. Moreover, learning by doing is more efficient: grade improvements of 1 standard-deviation require 10-20% less time in learning by doing than reading. Finally, we contrast this evidence with students’ a priori intuitions on best study strategies for their online course. Students overestimate the value of explicit learning through reading, and underestimate the value of active learning.",>Paulo Carvalho>Elizabeth McLaughlin>Ken Koedinger,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0050/index.html

The model achieves a good fit with existing data at the group level and correctly identifies two distinct cognitive mechanisms held to underlie two distinct types of error. However, the correlations amongst other error types produced by the model differ from those observed in the human data. To address this, we cluster participant performance into distinct groups and show, by fitting each group separately, how the model can account for the empirically observed correlations between error types. Methodologically, this demonstrates the importance of modelling participant performance at the sub-group level, rather than modelling group performance. We also discuss implications of the model for the WCST performance of elderly participants and Parkinson’s patients.",>Andrea Caso>Richard P.

2017,Distributional learning and lexical category acquisition: What makes words easy to categorize?,"In this study, results of computational simulations on English child-directed speech are presented to uncover what distributional properties of words make it easier to group them into lexical categories. This analysis provides evidence that words are easier to categorize when (i) they are hard to predict given the contexts they occur in; (ii) they occur in few different contexts; and (iii) their contextual distributions have a low entropy, meaning that they tend to occur more often in one of the contexts they occur in. This profile fits that of content words, especially nouns and verbs, which is consistent with developmental evidence showing that children learning English start by forming a noun and a verb category. These results further characterize the role of distributional information in lexical category acquisition and confirm that it is a robust, reliable, and developmentally plausible source to learn lexical categories.",>Giovanni Cassani>Robert Grimm>Steven Gillis>Walter Daelemans,">University of Antwerp, Belgium>University of Antwerp, Belgium>University of Antwerp, Belgium>University of Antwerp, Belgium",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0052/index.html

We provide evidence that this ability is naturally explained as the addition of new primitive elements to a compositional mental representation, such as that in the probabilistic Language Of Thought (LOT). We conducted a transfer-learning experiment in which participants learned about two sequences. We show that participants' ability to learn the second sequence is affected the first sequence they saw. We test two probabilistic models of how algorithmic knowledge is transferred from the first to second sequence: one model rationally updates the prior probability of the primitive operations in the LOT; the other stores previously likely hypotheses as new primitives. Both models outperform baselines in explaining behavior, with human subjects appearing to transfer entire hypotheses when they can, and otherwise updating the prior on primitives.",>Samuel Cheyette>Steve Piantadosi,">University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA>University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0053/index.html
2017,Cross-situational learning of novel anaphors,"Word learning research has shown that learners constrain the hypothesis space for word meanings by using multiple sources of information, such as cross-situational regularities of word-context co-occurrences or syntactic cues like the number of arguments. These studies typically focus on word meaning development where these cues can be helpful but not necessary. As such, it sheds little light on the acquisition of anaphors, which requires tracking syntactic dependencies across situations. To test whether or how learners track this information, we conducted a novel anaphor learning experiment with English and Japanese speakers, manipulating cross-situational regularities in anaphors and their syntactic dependencies. Results show both English and Japanese speakers closely track the frequency of interpretive possibilities for novel anaphors. However, they demonstrate difficulties learning long-distance reflexives, which are compatible with either local or non-local antecedents. This suggests that successful anaphor learning requires more than cross-situational regularities of interpretive possibilities.",>Karen Clothier>Satoshi Nambu>Hajime Ono>Akira Omaki,">Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States>Monash University, Australia>Tsuda College, Tokyo, Japan>University of Washington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0054/index.html

We examined the temporal trajectory of three traits that may correspond to resources in romantic relationships—trust, love, and satisfaction—to determine whether they behave like depleting or replenishing patches from a foraging perspective. All three rise over time in intact relationships—suggesting replenishment—but plateau or fall in dissolved relationships—suggesting depletion. Survival analysis demonstrated that higher ratings of all three quality variables decreased the risk of romantic dissolution. The results suggest that these cues are lower in dissolved relationships, indicating individuals could potentially use them as cues for leaving an unsatisfactory relationship patch via aspiration-level cognitive mechanisms.",>Samantha Cohen>Peter Todd,">Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA>Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0055/index.html

Fostering such understanding in learners is therefore a key goal in education. We hypothesized that observing analogical gestures—which represent relational information in visuospatial format— would lead learners to notice and reason about underlying causal patterns, such as positive and negative feedback. Participants watched brief video lectures about the human body and the plant kingdom, which were delivered along with gestures representing either: 1) visuospatial details (iconic gesture condition); or 2) relational structure (analogical gesture condition). In a subsequent classification task, relative to participants who saw iconic gestures, participants who saw analogical gestures were more likely to sort the phenomena described in the videos—as well as novel phenomena—by their causal structure (e.g., positive feedback). The results suggest that analogical gestures can be harnessed to foster causal understanding.",>Kensy Cooperrider>Dedre Gentner>Susan Goldin-Meadow,>University of Chicago>Northwestern University>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0056/index.html

Spatial construction appears early in development, predicts later spatial and mathematical skills, and is used throughout life. Despite its importance, we know little about the cognitive processes underlying skilled construction. Construction tasks are highly complex but analyses have tended to focus on broad-stroke measures of end-goal accuracy. In this paper we introduce a novel behavioral coding formalism to characterize an individual’s entire construction process, examine many individuals’ processes in aggregate, and summarize patterns that emerge. The results show high consistency at certain points occurring throughout the construction, but also indicate flexibility in the interim paths that lead to and diverge from these points. Our approach offers a new method that can more precisely describe the behavioral patterns observed during construction in order to reveal the underlying cognitive processes engaged, and capture individual differences in building expertise.",>Cathryn S.

Each of these identities represent specific agreement with the requirements of normative probability theory; strikingly, these identities seem to hold in people’s probability judgments despite the presence of strong and systematic biases against the requirements of normative probability theory in those very same judgments.

It plays an important role in wine expertise. Previous research shows experts’ superior cognitive abilities do not transfer beyond their domain of expertise. This leads to two questions: do wine experts have more vivid imagery for the multisensory experience of wine? And how general is wine experts’ olfactory imagery? Wine experts and novices completed a questionnaire measuring the vividness of imagery for the color, smell, and flavor of wine. In addition, all participants completed a questionnaire on general smell imagery. Wine experts were better than novices at imagining wines in all modalities, but not better at imagining smells in general.

Yet traditional research in the psychology of reasoning found that people did not endorse this inference as highly as other one-premise valid inferences. A radical response to this finding is to claim that or-introduction is in fact invalid. This response is found in the recent revision of mental model theory (MMT). We argue that this revision of the theory leads to a number of logical problems and counterintuitive consequences for valid inferences, and present an experiment extending recent studies showing that people readily accept or-introduction under probabilistic instructions. We argue for a pragmatic explanation of why the inference is sometimes considered odd.

2017,A Dynamic Tradeoff Model of Intertemporal Choice,"The delay discounting perspective, which assumes an alternative-wise processing of attribute information, has long dominated research on intertemporal choice. Recent studies, however, have suggested that intertemporal choice is based on attribute-wise comparison. This line of research culminated in the tradeoff model (Scholten & Read, 2010; Scholten, Read, & Sanborn, 2014), which can accommodate most established behavioral regularities in intertemporal choice. One drawback of the tradeoff model, however, is that it is static, providing no account of the dynamic process leading to a choice. Here we develop a dynamic tradeoff model that can qualitatively account for empirical findings in intertemporal choice regarding not only choices but also response times. The dynamic model also outperforms the original, static tradeoff model when quantitatively fitting choices from representative data sets, and even outperforms the best-performing dynamic model derived from Decision Field Theory in Dai and Busemeyer (2014) when fitting both choices and response times.",>Junyi Dai>Timothy Pleskac>Thorsten Pachur,>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0061/index.html

In this paper I offer a functional definition of learning from a cognitive science perspective, which attempts to account for the presence of learning in different physical substrates. The definition is that a particular event should be considered a good example of “learning” to the degree to which the following characteristics describe it: 1) a system undergoes change to its informational state or processing 2) the change is for the purpose of more effective future action, 3) the change is in response what the system experiences, and 4) the system executes the change, rather than some outside force.

2017,Comprehenders Rationally Adapt Semantic Predictions to the Statistics of the Local Environment: a Bayesian Model of Trial-by-Trial N400 Amplitudes,"When semantic information is activated by a context prior to new bottom-up input (i.e. when a word is predicted), semantic processing of that incoming word is typically facilitated, attenuating the amplitude of the N400 event related potential (ERP) – a direct neural measure of semantic processing. This is observed even when the context is a single semantically related “prime” word. This “N400 semantic priming effect” is sensitive to the probability of seeing a related prime-target pair within experimental blocks, suggesting that participants may be adapting the strength of their predictions to match the environment. We formalize this adaptation using Bayesian updating, and link this model to N400 amplitude using an information-theoretic measure, surprisal. We found that this model explained N400 amplitudes (whether for related or unrelated words) as adaptation unfolded. These findings suggest that comprehenders rationally adapt their semantic predictions to the statistics of their environment.",>Nathaniel Delaney-Busch>Emily Morgan>Ellen Lau>Gina Kuperberg>Gina Kuperberg,">Psychology Department, Tufts University>Psychology Department, Tufts University>Department of Linguistics, University of Maryland>Department of Psychology, Tufts University>Department of Psychiatry and the Athinoula A.

2017,The Role of Imagination in Exemplar Generation: The Effects of Conflict and Explanation,"Structured imagination refers to reliance upon prior knowledge when generating novel examples of a provided category. Yet studies supporting this tenet use experimental designs where the stimuli themselves cue exemplars based on culturally relevant items. The present study combined exemplar generation with abstract stimuli as a means of attenuating instructional bias. Participants were shown a group of abstract shapes identified as a single category and instructed to generate another member of this category. We additionally examined whether the introduction of a cognitive conflict (by including an anomalous category member) and self-explanation during generation affected the level of imaginative responses. Contrary to expectations, the presentation of a conflicting category member did not result in more imaginative responses when compared to more homogenous stimuli sets. However, a significantly greater degree of imaginative responses was observed from participants who were required to explain their thinking prior to and whilst constructing their exemplars.",>Tammy Dennis>Daniel Little,">University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia>The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0065/index.html

After a retention interval of one week, they were asked to judge the specific day on which each of a selection of images was taken. To account for people’s judgements, we proposed a mixture model of four processes - uniform guessing, a signal detection process based on decaying memory strength, a week confusion process and a event confusion process in which the sensor streams were used to calculate the similarity of events. A model selection exercise testing all possible subsets of the processes favoured a model that included only the event confusion model.

2017,Refixations gather new visual information rationally,"The standard model is that word identification in reading is a holistic process, most efficient when words are centered in the visual field. In contrast, rational models of reading predict word identification to be a constructive process, where readers efficiently gather visual information about a word, and may combine visual information about different parts of the word obtained across multiple fixations to identify it. We tease apart these accounts by arguing that rational models should predict that the most efficient place in a word to make a second fixation (refixation) depends on the visual information the reader has already obtained.We present evidence supporting this prediction from an eye movement corpus. Computational model simulations confirm that a rational model predicts this finding, but a model implementing holistic identification does not. These results suggest that refixations can be well understood as rationally gathering visual information, and that word identification works constructively.",>Yunyan Duan>Klinton Bicknell,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0067/index.html

2017,Refining the distributional hypothesis: A role for time and context in semantic representation,"Distributional models of semantics assume that the meaning of a given word is a function of the contexts in which it occurs. In line with this, prior research suggests that a word’s semantic representation can be manipulated – pushed toward a target meaning, for example – by situating that word in distributional contexts frequented by the target. Left open to question is the role that order plays in the distributional construction of meaning. Learning occurs in time, and it can produce asymmetric outcomes depending on the order in which information is presented. Discriminative learning models predict that systematically manipulating a word’s preceding context should more strongly influence its meaning than should varying what follows. We find support for this hypothesis in three experiments in which we manipulated subjects’ contextual experience with novel and marginally familiar words, while varying the locus of manipulation.",>Melody Dye>Michael Jones>Daniel Yarlett>Michael Ramscar,">Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington>Referral Exchange>University of Tübingen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0069/index.html
2017,Cute Little Puppies and Nice Cold Beers: An Information Theoretic Analysis of Prenominal Adjectives,"A central goal of typological research is to characterize linguistic features in terms of both their functional role and their fit to social and cognitive systems. One longstanding puzzle concerns why certain languages employ grammatical gender. In an information theoretic analysis of German noun classification, Dye et al. (2017) enumerated a number of important processing advantages gender confers. Yet this raises a further puzzle: If gender systems are so beneficial to processing, what does this mean for languages without them? Here, we compare the communicative function of gender marking in German (a deterministic system) to that of prenominal adjectives in English (a probabilistic one), finding that despite their differences, both systems act to efficiently smooth information over discourse, making nouns more equally predictable in context. We examine why evolutionary pressures may favor one solution over another, and discuss the implications for compositional accounts of meaning and Gricean principles of communication.",>Melody Dye>Petar Milin>Richard Futrell>Michael Ramscar,>Indiana University>University of Sheffield>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of Tübingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0070/index.html

The finding that LF items consistently outperform HF items in recognition was once termed the “frequency paradox”, as LF items are less well represented in memory. However, recognition is known to be influenced both by ‘context noise’—the prior contexts in which an item has appeared—and ‘item noise’—interference from other items present within the list context. In a typical recognition list, HF items will suffer more interference than LF items. To illustrate this principle, we deliberately manipulated both the contexts in which critical items had been encountered prior to study, and the confusability of targets and distractors. Our results suggest that when noise sources are balanced, the mirror effect disappears.",>Melody Dye>Michael Jones>Richard Shiffrin,">Indiana University>Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington , IN, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0071/index.html

Participants played a version of the children’s game “Telephone”. The first generation was asked to imitate recognizable environmental sounds (e.g., glass breaking, water splashing); subsequent generations imitated the imitators for a total of 8 generations. We then examined whether the vocal imitations became more stable and word-like, retained a resemblance to the original sound, and became more suitable as learned category labels. The results showed (1) the imitations became progressively more word-like, (2) even after 8 generations, they could be matched above chance to the environmental sound that motivated them, and (3) imitations from later generations were more effective as learned category labels. These results show how repeated imitation can create progressively more word-like forms while retaining a semblance of iconicity.",>Pierce Edmiston>Marcus Perlman>Gary Lupyan,">University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Gelderland, Netherlands>University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0072/index.html

In so doing, the model displays behaviors that in humans have been characterized as exemplifying inferencing of unmentioned event components, the prediction of upcoming components (which may or may not ever happen or be mentioned), reconstructive memory, and the ability to flexibly accommodate novel variations from previously encountered experiences.

2017,Explaining Enculturated Cognition,"Many of our cognitive capacities are shaped by enculturation. Enculturation is the temporally extended transformative acquisition of cognitive practices such as reading, writing, and mathematics. They are embodied and normatively constrained ways to interact with epistemic resources (e.g., writing systems, number systems). Enculturation is associated with significant changes of the organization and connectivity of the brain and of the functional profiles of embodied actions and motor programs. Furthermore, it has a socio-culturally structured dimension, because it relies on cumulative cultural evolution and on the socially distributed acquisition of cognitive norms governing the engagement with epistemic resources. This paper argues that we need distinct, yet complementary levels of explanation and corresponding temporal scales. This leads to explanatory pluralism about enculturated cognition, which is the view that we need multiple perspectives and explanatory strategies to account for the complexity of enculturation.",>Regina E.

Despite much research on the spatial grounding of temporal language and thought, little attention has been given to how spatial metaphors influence reasoning about real events, especially those in the future. In a large online study (N=2362), we framed a discussion of climate change using spatial metaphors that varied on reference-frame (ego- vs. time-moving), speed of movement (fast vs. slow), and time horizon (near, medium, or far future). We found that describing climate change as approaching (time-moving frame) –versus something we approach– made the issue seem more serious, but also more tractable, at least when the rate of motion was fast (e.g., “it’s rapidly approaching”). These findings offer novel insights into the relationship between spatial metaphors and temporal reasoning and how we communicate about uncertain future events.",>Stephen Flusberg>Teenie Matlock>Paul Thibodeau,">Purchase College, SUNY>University of California, Merced>Oberlin College",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0077/index.html

Previous accounts have focussed on infants’ ability to show an adult-like understanding of colour terms. Here we examine whether infants understand colour terms at a basic level, using two different methods: evidence from parental reports that British infants can comprehend colour terms early, second from experimental data using eye-tracking. These finding show that colour word learning is a process that begins much earlier than previously thought, and develops slowly as infants learn where the boundaries of each term are located. Due to their abstract properties, colour words present a unique opportunity to assess category learning in infants, as well as the mechanisms that control word learning in general.",>Samuel Forbes>Kim Plunkett,>University of Oxford>University of Oxford,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0078/index.html
2017,Word Identification Under Multimodal Uncertainty,"Identifying the visual referent of a spoken word – that a particular insect is referred to by the word “bee” – requires both the ability to process and integrate multi-modal input and the ability to reason under uncertainty. How do these tasks interact with one another? We introduce a task that allows us to ex- amine how adults identify words under joint uncertainty in the auditory and visual modalities. We propose a ideal observer model of the task which provides an optimal baseline. Model predictions are tested in two experiments where word recognition is made under two kinds of uncertainty: category ambiguity and distorting noise. In both cases, the ideal observer model explains much of the variance in human judgments. But when one modality had noise added to it, human perceivers systematically preferred the unperturbed modality to a greater extent than the ideal observer model did.",>Abdellah Fourtassi>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0079/index.html
2017,Could both be right? Children's and adults' sensitivity to subjectivity in language,"While some word meanings, like ""spotted,"" depend on intersubjectively accessible properties of the world, others like ""pretty"" invoke speakers' subjective beliefs. We explored children and adults' sensitivity to the subjectivity of a range of adjectives. Participants saw two speakers who had independently experienced distributions of exemplars of a novel object kind disagree about whether a critical exemplar was, e.g., ""tall,"" ""pretty,"" and ""spotted."" In Experiments 1 and 3, speakers had seen distinct distributions, while in Experiments 2 and 4, the distributions were identical. Adults always judged disagreements over adjectives like ""pretty"" as faultless—indicating that both speakers ""could be right""—and permitted less faultless disagreement for adjectives like ""tall"" when the speakers had seen identical distributions of exemplars. Strikingly, children did not respond in an adult-like manner until age 8 or 9, but their explanations for speakers' conflicting assertions suggested some sensitivity to the kinds of knowledge relevant for evaluating different adjectives.",>Ruthe Foushee>Mahesh Srinivasan,">University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0080/index.html

The current study shows that the reading-time effect disappears when word surprisal is factored out, suggesting that the earlier findings were caused by a confound between semantic distance and surprisal. This absence of a behavioural effect of semantic distance (in the presence of a strong neurophysiological effect) may be due to methodological differences between eye-tracking and EEG experiments, but it can also be interpreted as evidence that eye movements are optimized for reading efficiency.",>Stefan Frank,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0081/index.html

However, contemporary results indicate that individuals seem sensitive to their biases; they seem to detect conflict with reasoning norms. One of the key remaining questions is whether this conflict sensitivity is domain general. To address this question, we administered a battery of five classical reasoning tasks to a large sample of subjects and assessed their conflict detection efficiency on each task by measuring their response confidence.

2017,Empirical tests of large-scale collaborative recall,"Much of our knowledge is transmitted socially rather than through firsthand experience. Even our memories depend on recollections of those around us. Surprisingly, when people recall memories with others, they do not reach the potential number of items they could have recalled alone. This phenomenon is called ""collaborative inhibition"". Recently, Luhmann and Rajaram (2015) analyzed the dynamics of collaborative inhibition at scale with an agent-based model, extrapolating from previous small-scale laboratory experiments. We tested their model against human data collected in a large-scale experiment and found that participants demonstrate non-monotonicities not evident in these predictions. We next analyzed memory transmission beyond directly interacting agents by placing agents into networks. Contrary to model predictions, we observed high similarity only within directly interacting pairs. By comparing behavior to model predictions in large-scale experiments, we reveal unexpected results that motivate future work in elucidating the algorithms underlying collaborative memory.",>Monica Gates>Jordan Suchow>Thomas Griffiths,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0084/index.html

The HSM predicts that people judge physical support by mentally simulating what would happen if the object of interest were removed. Two experiments test the model by asking participants to evaluate the extent to which one brick in a tower is responsible for the rest of the bricks staying on a table. The results of both experiments show a very close correspondence between hypothetical simulations and responsibility judgments. We compare three versions of the HSM which differ in how they model people's uncertainty about what would happen. Participants' selections of which bricks would fall are best explained by assuming that hypothetical interventions only lead to local changes while leaving the rest of the scene unchanged.,>Tobias Gerstenberg>Liang Zhou>Kevin Smith>Joshua Tenenbaum,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0085/index.html
2017,Gaze Shifts between Text and Illustrations are Negatively Related to Reading Fluency in Beginning Readers,"Learning to read is often considered the most important skill taught in school because reading is a gateway to other learning. Many children struggle to acquire this fundamental skill. Suboptimal design of books for beginning readers may contribute to the difficulties children experience as close proximity between text and illustrations could promote attentional competition hampering literacy skills. The present work utilized eye-tracking technology to examine how beginning readers allocate attention and whether these patterns are related to fluency (Experiment 1) and comprehension (Experiment 2). Results suggest when reading books in which text and illustrations are in close proximity, children frequently shift attention away from the text. This pattern of attention was negatively associated with fluency, but not associated with comprehension. This line of research aims to provide theoretical insights about design principles for reading materials that can be employed to optimize instructional materials and promote literacy development in young children.",>Karrie E.

Recent neural network models that incorporate explicit memory and attention mechanisms have taken steps towards this capability. However, these models have not been tested in scenarios that require reasoning about the unobservable mental states of other agents. We propose a new set of tasks inspired by the well-known false belief test to examine how a recent question-answering model performs in situations that require reasoning about latent mental states. We find that the model is only successful when the training and test data bear substantial similarity because it memorizes how to answer specific questions. We introduce an extension to the model that simulates the mental representations of different participants in a reasoning task, and show that this capacity increases the model's performance on our theory of mind test.",>Erin Grant>Aida Nematzadeh>Thomas L.

2017,Evidence for a facilitatory effect of multi-word units on child word learning,"Previous studies have suggested that children possess cognitive representations of multi-word units (MWUs) and that MWUs can facilitate the acquisition of smaller units contained within them. We propose that the formation of MWU representations precedes and facilitates the formation of single-word representations in children. Using different computational methods, we extract MWUs from two large corpora of English child-directed speech. In subsequent regression analyses, we use age of first production of individual words as the dependent and the number of MWUs within which each word appears as an independent variable. We find that early-learned words appear within many MWUs -- an effect which is neither reducible to frequency or other common co-variates, nor to the number of context words contained in the MWUs. Our findings support accounts wherein children acquire linguistic patterns of varying sizes, moving gradually from the discovery of MWUs to the acquisition of small-grained linguistic representations.",>Robert Grimm>Giovanni Cassani>Steven Gillis>Walter Daelemans,>University of Antwerp>University of Antwerp>University of Antwerp>University of Antwerp,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0089/index.html

In order to specify such interpretative processes, we created structurally isomorphic word problems that could be solved with two distinct algorithms. We tested whether a distinction between cardinal and ordinal quantities would lead solvers, due to their daily-life knowledge, to build different representations, influencing their strategies as well as the nature of their drawings. We compared 5th grade children and adults in order to assess the validity of this hypothesis with participants of varying arithmetic proficiency. The results confirmed that the distinction between cardinal and ordinal situations led to different solving strategies and to different drawings among both age groups. This study supports the ontological distinction of cardinal versus ordinal quantities and calls for the consideration of the role of daily-life semantics when accounting for arithmetic problem solving processes.",>Hippolyte Gros>Jean-Pierre Thibaut>Emmanuel Sander,>Université Paris Descartes>Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté>Université Paris 8,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0090/index.html
2017,Does Mandarin Spatial Metaphor for Time Influence Chinese Deaf Signers’ Spatio-Temporal Reasoning?,"In Mandarin the space-time word “前/qian” is used to express both the spatial concept of front/forward and the temporal concept of early/before. In Chinese Sign Languages, however, the spatial front/forward and the temporal early/before are signed differently as the sign for spatial front is only used for the spatial concept of forward, and the sign for before/past is directed to the back. In this study we investigate whether the Mandarin sagittal space-time metaphors influence Chinese deaf signers’ spatio-temporal reasoning. In two experiments, we found that signers with higher Mandarin proficiency were more likely to interpret the Mandarin word “前/qian” as the temporal past (Study1), and to perform past-in-front space-time mappings (Study2) as opposed to signers with lower Mandarin proficiency. The findings not only provide within-culture evidence for the influence of language on thought, but also demonstrate that even cross-modal space-time metaphors can impact deaf-signers’ spatio-temporal reasoning.",>Yan Gu>Yeqiu Zheng>Marc Swerts,">Tilburg School of Humanities, Tilburg University, The Netherlands>Department of Econometrics and Operations Research, Tilburg University, the Netherlands>Tilburg School of Humanities, Tilburg University, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0091/index.html

Participants engaged in a ‘memory game’, tapping their use of demonstratives to describe objects located on a sagittal plane (Experiment 1) and the influence of demonstratives on memory for object location (Experiment 2). In addition to distance from speaker, the experiments also manipulated the position of a conspecific (next to or opposite participants). Distance and position of conspecific both affected demonstrative choice and memory in Japanese, with similar effects in English even though English does not explicitly encode the position of a conspecific.

2017,A Computational Model for the Dynamical Learning of Event Taxonomies,"We present a computational model that can learn event taxonomies online from the continuous sensorimotor information flow perceived by an agent while interacting with its environment. Our model implements two fundamental learning biases. First, it learns probabilistic event models as temporal sensorimotor forward models and event transition models, which predict event model transitions given particular perceptual circumstances. Second, learning is based on the principle of minimizing free energy, which is further biased towards the detection of free energy transients. As a result, the algorithm forms conceptual structures that encode events and event boundaries. We show that event taxonomies can emerge when the algorithm is run on multiple levels of precision. Moreover, we show that generally any type of forward model can be used, as long as it learns sufficiently fast. Finally, we show that the developed structures can be used to hierarchically plan goal-directed behavior by means of active inference.",>Christian Gumbsch>Sebastian Otte>Martin Butz,">Chair of Cognitive Modeling, Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>Chair of Cognitive Modeling, Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany>Chair of Cognitive Modeling, Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0093/index.html

To decide whether to tackle a task or how to divide labor across people, we must estimate the difficult of the goal in the absence of prior experience. Here we examine adults' and preschoolers' inferences about the difficulty of simple block-building tasks. Exp.1 first established that building time is a useful proxy for difficulty. Exp.2 asked participants to view the initial and final states of various block-building tasks and judge their relative difficulty. While adults were near-ceiling on all trials, children showed varying levels of performance depending on the nature of the dimensions that varied across structures. Exp. 3 replicated the pattern. These results suggest that children can reverse-engineer the process of goal-directed actions to infer the relative difficulty of novel tasks, although their ability to incorporate more nuanced factors may continue to develop.",>Hyowon Gweon>Mika Asaba>Grace Bennett-Pierre,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0094/index.html

2017,Perceptual contrast and response assimilation in sequential categorization without feedback,"Sequential categorization of perceptual stimuli typically shows contrast from one trial to the next. Using familiar categories of animals and faces, contrast effects were dissociated from assimilation effects. Two independent main effects were observed: contrast to the preceding stimulus, and assimilation to the previous response. It is argued that contrast and assimilation may reflect different processes in categorization.",>James Hampton,">City, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0096/index.html

He draws this conclusion from his understanding of cognition as an extended process. I question this conclusion because this view expands cognition beyond being the sort of natural kind to which one can tie phenomenal experience. Moreover, because cognition has been radically inflated, despite Chemero’s claim to the contrary, embodied cognition does not solve any of the hard problems associated with consciousness.",>Valerie Hardcastle,>University of Cincinnati,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0097/index.html
2017,Convention-formation in iterated reference games,"What cognitive mechanisms support the emergence of linguistic conventions from repeated interaction? We present results from a large-scale, multi-player replication of the classic tangrams task, focusing on three foundational properties of conventions: arbitrariness, stability, and reduction of utterance length over time. These results motivate a theory of convention-formation where agents, though initially uncertain about word meanings in context, assume others are using language with such knowledge. Thus, agents may learn about meanings by reasoning about a knowledgeable, informative partner; if all agents engage in such a process, they successfully coordinate their beliefs, giving rise to a conventional communication system. We formalize this theory in a computational model of language understanding as social inference and demonstrate that it produces all three properties in a simplified domain.",>Robert X.d.

Our model assumes that people are sensitive to the effects of different sampling frames applied to sampled evidence. Two studies tested the model by comparing property generalization following exposure to samples selected because they belong to the same taxonomic category or because they share a salient property. Both studies found that category-based sampling led to broader generalization than property-based sampling. In line with model predictions, these differences were attenuated when a mixture of positive and negative evidence was presented (Experiment 1) and when category-property relations were probabilistic rather than deterministic (Experiment 2).",>Brett Hayes>Stephanie Banner>Daniel Navarro,>University of New South Wales>University of New South Wales>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0099/index.html
2017,The adaptive evolution of early human symbolic behavior,"Dating back as far as 100 ka, the Blombos ochre and the Diepkloof ostrich egg engravings are considered among the earliest fossilized evidence of human symbolic behavior. Of special interest to this study is the temporal trajectory spanning more than 30 thousand years from earlier simpler parallel line patterns to later complex cross-hatchings suggesting adaptive compositional development. Through a series of three psychophysical experiments we test the hypotheses that the line engravings at each site evolved to become 1) more salient to the human perceptual system, 2) more discriminable from each other, and 3) increasingly associated with symbolic intent. Our findings suggest that just as instrumental tools have been found to undergo cumulative refinements in adaptation to their function, the ochre and egg shell engravings evolved adaptively to become more fit for their cognitive function as signs.",>Katrin Heimann>Riccardo Fusaroli>Sergio Gonzalez de La Higuera Rojo>Niels Nørkjær Johannsen>Felix Riede>Nicolas Fay>Marlize Lombard>Kristian Tylén,>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>University of Western Australia>University of Johannesburg>Aarhus University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0100/index.html
2017,Children’s social referencing reflects sensitivity to graded uncertainty,"The ability to monitor uncertainty is critical for self-directed learning. However, little is known about children's ability to detect uncertainty in their mental representations. Here we asked whether a spontaneous information-gathering behavior -- social referencing -- reflects uncertainty during early childhood. Children ages 2-5 were presented with one or two objects, heard a label, and were asked to put the object in a bucket. In Experiment 1, there were one or two novel or familiar objects, with the referent being ambiguous on two-novel trials. In Experiment 2, there were additionally trials with one familiar and one novel object. In both experiments, children referenced the experimenter more when the referent was ambiguous. In Experiment 2, children also referenced the experimenter more when there were one familiar and one novel object, but only when the experimenter did not gaze at the target, suggesting that children's social referencing is sensitive to epistemic uncertainty.",>Emily Hembacher>Benjamin demayo>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0101/index.html
2017,Investigating the Explore/Exploit Trade-off in Adult Causal Inferences,"We explore how adults learn counterintuitive causal relationships, and whether they discover hypotheses by revising their beliefs incrementally. We examined how adults learned a novel and unusual causal rule when presented with data that initially appeared to conform to a simpler, more salient rule. Adults watched a video of several blocks placed sequentially on a “blicket detector”, and were then asked to determine the underlying causal structure. In the “near” condition the true rule was complex, but could be found by making incremental improvements to the simple and salient initial hypothesis. The “distant” condition was governed by a simpler rule, but to adopt that rule participants had to set aside their initial beliefs, rather than revising them incrementally. Adults performed better in the near condition, despite this rule being more complex, providing some of the first evidence for an “explore-exploit” trade-off in inference, analogous to the trade-off in active learning.",>Erik Herbst>Christopher Lucas>Daphna Buchsbaum,>University of Toronto>University of Edinburgh>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0102/index.html

While making these inferences, people tend to draw information from only one possible categorization of a new object; in addition, people are sensitive to pre-existing correlations between features. Here, we explain these trends of feature inference using a priming-based cognitive process model, and show that our model is distinguished in that it can explain not only these two main trends, but also cases where people seem to reverse the first trend and base inferences on information from multiple categories.",>Laura Hiatt,>U.S. Naval Research Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0104/index.html
2017,Quantifying the impact of active choice in word learning,"Past theoretical studies on word learning sought to explain the speed of children’s word learning using models sampling from a uniform word frequency (WF) distribution. We consider more realistic nonuniform, long-tailed WF distributions (i.e., Zipfian or power-law). Our new mathematical analysis of a recently-proposed simple learning model suggests that the model is unable to account for word learning in feasible time for Zipfian distributions. Considering children do learn these distributions, we propose a type of self-directed learning where the learner can help construct the contexts from which they learn words. We show that active learners choosing optimal situations can learn words hundreds of times faster than learners given randomly-sampled situations. In agreement with past empirical studies, we find theoretical support for the idea that statistical structure in real-world situations--perhaps influenced by a self-directed learner, and/or by a teacher--is a potential remedy for learning words with Zipf-distributed frequency.",>Shohei Hidaka>Takuma Torii>George Kachergis,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Radboud University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0105/index.html

We tested for the selection of three different reference systems: the body orientation, the visual vertical of the surrounding room, and the direction of gravity. Participants learned and retrieved differently colored objects on a vertical board with body and room orientations varying in relation to gravity and each other systematically. Across all three experiments participants were quicker or more accurate in memory recall when they saw the vertical spatial layout in the same orientation in relation to their body vertical as during learning, irrespective of the direction of gravity or visual room upright. These results indicate that spatial long-term memories for small-scale vertical relations are mainly defined in an egocentric reference system with respect to the body vertical despite the availability of alternative highly salient allocentric reference directions.",>Thomas Hinterecker>Caroline Leroy>Maximilian E.

For instance, a dog owner might move the dog so it eats out of the right bowl, or a coach might intervene while a tennis player is practicing to teach a skill. How do people teach by intervention? And how do these strategies interact with learning mechanisms? Here, we examine one global and two local strategies: working backwards from the end-goal of a task (backwards chaining), placing a learner in a previous state when an incorrect action was taken (undoing), or placing a learner in the state they would be in if they had taken the correct action (correcting). Depending on how the learner interprets an intervention, different teaching strategies result in better learning. We also examine how people teach by intervention in an interactive experiment and find a bias for using local strategies like undoing.",>Mark Ho>Michael Littman>Joseph Austerweil,">Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA>Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0107/index.html
2017,Computational and behavioral investigations of the SOB-CS removal mechanism in working memory,"The SOB-CS computational model of working memory explains findings from simple and complex span experiments. According to the model’s mechanism of interference by superposition, high similarity between memory items and subsequently processed distractors is beneficial because the more a distractor is similar to an item, the more they share similar units, leading to less distortion of the memory item. When time allows, SOB-CS removes interfering distractors from memory by unbinding them from their context. The combination of these two mechanisms leads to the prediction that when free time is long enough to remove the distractors entirely, similarity between items and distractors should no longer be beneficial to memory performance. The aim of our study was to test this prediction with humans and simulations. Experimental data disconfirmed the prediction. Simulations showed that SOB-CS overestimated the strength of removal which has to be much lower than expected to account for experimental data.",>Violette Hoareau>Sophie Portrat>Klaus Oberauer>Benoit Lemaire>Gaën Plancher>Stephan Lewandowsky,">Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France>Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France>Universitat at Zurich>Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France>Université Lyon 2>University of Bristol",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0108/index.html

Children aged 7-11 years (N=123) completed a battery of five spatial tasks, based on a model of spatial ability in which skills fall along two dimensions: intrinsic-extrinsic; static-dynamic. Participants also answered science questions from standardised assessments, grouped into conceptual topic areas. Spatial scaling (extrinsic static spatial ability) and mental folding (intrinsic dynamic spatial ability) each emerged as predictors of total science scores, with mental folding accounting for more variance than spatial scaling. Mental folding predicted both physics and biology scores, whereas spatial scaling accounted for additional variance only in biology scores. The embedded figures task (intrinsic static spatial ability) predicted chemistry scores. The pattern was consistent across the age range. These findings provide novel evidence for the differential role of distinct aspects of spatial ability in relation to children’s science performance.",>Alex Hodgkiss>Katie Gilligan>Michael Thomas>Andrew Tolmie>Emily Farran,">UCL Institute of Education, London, United Kingdom>UCL Institute of Education, London, United Kingdom>Birkbeck College, University of London, United Kingdom>UCL Institute of Education, London, United Kingdom>UCL Institute of Education, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0109/index.html

But what about ‘moving together’ produces affiliation: the movements themselves, or the social context of moving ‘together’? We instructed pairs of participants to listen to music and move their arms or legs according to shapes appearing on screen. They either carried out the same movements, or when one moved their arms the other moved their legs. They either saw shapes on one laptop, or each had their own laptop. Surprisingly, participants did not like each other more if they carried out the same movements, but affiliation did increase if they danced looking at the same screen. Rather than their movements, instructions, intentions or perceptual experiences, here it is the social context of the actions that produces affiliation, a surprising finding that is not easily accounted for by the dominant theories of mimicry and behavioural synchrony.",>Lilla Hodossy>Jorina von Zimmermann>Daniel Richardson,>Royal Holloway University>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0110/index.html
2017,Modeling Sources of Uncertainty in Spoken Word Learning,"In order to successfully learn the meaning of words such as bin or pin, language learners must not only perceive relevant differences in the speech signal but also learn mappings from words to referents. Prior work in native (Stager & Werker, 1997) and second (Pajak, Creel, & Levy, 2016) language acquisition has found that the ability to perceptually discriminate between words does not guarantee successful word learning. Learners fail to utilize knowledge that they can otherwise use in speech perception. To explore possible mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon, we developed a probabilistic model that infers both a word’s phonetic form and its associated referent. By analyzing different versions of the model fitted to experimental results from Pajak et al. (2016), we argue that a mechanism for spoken word learning needs to incorporate both perceptual uncertainty as well as additional, task-specific sources of uncertainty.",>Matthias Hofer>Roger Levy,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0111/index.html
2017,Knowledge of Cross-Linguistic Semantic Diversity Reduces Essentialist Beliefs about Categories,"The words of different languages partition the world in strikingly different ways. Yet many people are unaware of such differences, believing that some of the words of their native language pick out discrete categories based in nature. We investigated whether knowledge of cross-linguistic semantic diversity—putatively inherent to bilingualism—can reduce such essentialist beliefs. In three experiments, we found (a) that bilinguals were less likely than monolinguals to judge membership for animal categories in essentialist terms, (b) that explicit exposure to cross-linguistic semantic diversity, independent of bilingualism, yielded similar effects, and (c) that this manipulation reduced essentialist beliefs about social categories as well. Together, our findings suggest that learning about how languages differ in their semantic systems—a form of metalinguistic knowledge—can lead people to think about categories more flexibly. Implications for research on language and thought, and for ameliorating the negative consequences of social essentialism, are discussed.",>Kevin Holmes>Erin Luby>Sarah Husney,>Colorado College>Colorado College>Colorado College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0112/index.html
2017,Decisions based on verbal probabilities: Decision bias or decision by belief sampling?,"We examined decisions based on verbal probability phrases, such as ""small chance,"" ""likely,"" or ""doubtful"" (we call these phrases verbal probabilities). Verbal probabilities have communicative functions called directionality and can be categorized into positive (e.g., ""likely"" or ""probable"") or negative (e.g., “unlikely,” “doubtful”) phrases in terms of their directionality. Previous studies have shown that the directionality of phrases affects decisions. Although such decisions seem biased, we argue that they are not. We hypothesize that since a speaker has the option to choose the directionality used during communication, the selected directionality becomes relevant information to a decision maker, and is taken into account in making decisions. We modeled these processes using the Decision by Belief Sampling (DbBS) model. We found that the observed data could be well explained by our hypothesis, and that the DbBS model could be one of the best potential models for decisions based on verbal probability information.",>Hidehito Honda>Toshihiko Matsuka>Kazuhiro Ueda,>The University of Tokyo>Chiba University>The University of Tokyo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0113/index.html
2017,"Semantic diversity, frequency and learning to read: A mini-mega study with children","Children who read more tend to be better readers than children who read less. Reading exposure captures not only the number of times words are experienced but also the breadth of the contexts words appear in. Using a large children’s corpus of written language, we quantified the former as word frequency and the latter as Semantic Diversity (SemD) (Hoffman et al., 2013). SemD was indexed using Latent Semantic Analysis to calculate the degree of semantic dissimilarity between the contexts in which each appeared. We selected 300 words that varied in SemD for a visual lexical decision and naming task with 9-year-old children (N=114). Results showed that both frequency and SemD were associated with performance, independently accounting for variation in speed and accuracy. Those words high in frequency and high in SemD were read more efficiently. These findings show that factors beyond frequency are important in determining children’s word reading.",>Yaling Hsiao>Kate Nation,>University of Oxford>University of Oxford,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0114/index.html
2017,Testing Statistical Learning Implicitly: A Novel Chunk-based Measure of Statistical Learning,"Attempts to connect individual differences in statistical learning with broader aspects of cognition have received considerable attention, but have yielded mixed results. A possible explanation is that statistical learning is typically tested using the two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. As a meta-cognitive task relying on explicit familiarity judgments, 2AFC may not accurately capture implicitly formed statistical computations. In this paper, we adapt the classic serial-recall memory paradigm to implicitly test statistical learning in a statistically-induced chunking recall (SICR) task. We hypothesized that artificial language exposure would lead subjects to chunk recurring statistical patterns, facilitating recall of words from the input. Experiment 1 demonstrates that SICR offers more fine-grained insights into individual differences in statistical learning than 2AFC. Experiment 2 shows that SICR has higher test-retest reliability than that reported for 2AFC. Thus, SICR offers a more sensitive measure of individual differences, suggesting that basic chunking abilities may explain statistical learning.",>Erin S. Isbilen>Stewart M.

2017,Minimal covariation data support future one-shot inferences about unobservable properties of novel agents,"When we reason about others’ behavior, there are often many equally-plausible explanations. If Bob climbs a tree to get an apple, we may be unsure if Bob found climbing difficult but really wanted an apple; if he found climbing easy and was not particularly excited about the apple; or if he found climbing intrinsically fun and just got the apple because it was convenient. Past research suggests that we solve this problem by obtaining repeated observations about the agent and about the world. Here we argue that, beyond allowing us to sharpen our inferences about agents and the world, covariation data also enables us to do one-shot inferences about novel agents. We show that given minimal covariation data, people can infer objective and subjective properties of a new agent from a single event. We show that a model that assumes that agents maximize utilities matches participant judgments with quantitative precision.",>Julian Jara-Ettinger>Hyowon Gweon,>Yale University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0116/index.html
2017,The Semantics and Pragmatics of Logical Connectives: Adults' and Children's Interpretations of And and Or in a Guessing Game,"The development of the ubiquitous logical connectives ""and"" and ""or"" provides a window into the role of semantics and pragmatics in children's linguistic development. Previous research suggested that adults and children might differ in their interpretation of ""or"" in two ways. First, unlike adults, children might interpret ""or"" as ""and"". Second, children might interpret ""or"" as inclusive disjunction while adults interpret it as exclusive. We report experimental studies that probe interpretations of ""and"" and ""or"" in adults and children using truth value judgements and children's spontaneous linguistic feedback. Both measures showed that four-year-olds do not interpret ""or"" as ""and"". Children's truth judgments suggested that they did not derive exclusivity implicatures. Yet their corrective feedback showed signs of sensitivity to the implicature, suggesting that the truth judgement task could have underestimated children's pragmatic competence.

Such miscommunications will have implications for perceived trust and expertise of the communicator, but it is not known whether this differs according to the communication format. We examined the effect of using verbal, numerical and mixed formats on perceptions of credibility and correctness, as well as whether they influenced a decision to evacuate, both before and after an ‘erroneous’ prediction (i.e. an ‘unlikely’ event occurs, or a ‘likely’ event does not occur). We observed no effect of communication format on any of the measures pre-outcome, but found the numerical format was perceived as less incorrect, as well as more credible than the other formats after an ‘erroneous’ prediction, but only when low probability expressions were used.

Outside of particular, narrow parameter ranges, changes in activity can easily result in total loss of control. Human cognition must have reliable means of acting to stay within the stable ranges of sensitivity and activation. Learning is one such mechanism, and population dynamics are another. Here, we focus on another, often overlooked stability mechanism: cellular homeostasis through metabolism dynamics. We ran a visual change detection experiment designed to strain network stability while minimizing any learnable patterns. We fit the data using models with and without cellular energy levels as a factor, finding that the model influenced by its past history of energy use was a closer fit to the human data.",>Gavin Jenkins>Jordan Barnes>Paul Tupper>Mark Blair,>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0119/index.html

Research studies and national test results demonstrate that many students fail to develop equivalence understanding. McNeil and colleagues suggest that this failure is partly due to the format of traditional instruction and practice with highly similar problems. On the change resistance account (McNeil & Alibali, 2005), students struggle with equivalence because they developed overgeneralized “rules” that affect how they process and approach math problems, and fail to see equations having two separate sides that are being related to one another. Practice with problems in a similar format encourages students to develop ineffective mental models of problem types. We replicate and extend prior work bringing cognitive science research to the classroom. Our findings indicate that applying research-based design principles in the form of varied structured practice improved student understanding of the concept of mathematical equivalence, which transfers to novel problem types.",>Kristen Johannes>Jodi Davenport>Yvonne Kao>Caroline Byrd Hornburg>Nicole McNeil,>WestEd>WestEd>WestEd>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0121/index.html

However, simpler explanations are not always normatively superior because they often do not fit the data as well as complex explanations. How do people negotiate this trade-off between prior probability (favoring simplicity) and goodness-of-fit (favoring complexity)? Here, we argue that people use opponent heuristics—relying on simplicity as a cue to prior probability but complexity as a cue to goodness-of-fit (Study 1). We also examine factors that lead one or the other heuristic to predominate in a given context. Study 2 finds that people have a stronger simplicity preference in deterministic rather than stochastic contexts, while Study 3 finds that people have a stronger simplicity preference for physical rather than social causal systems. Together, we argue that these cues and contextual moderators act as powerful constraints that help to specify otherwise ill-defined hypothesis comparison problems.",>Samuel Johnson>J. J.

Specifically, we find that people prefer explanations consistent with the conceptual order of the operations (“9÷3=3 because 3×3=9” rather than “3×3=9 because 9÷3=3”), and corresponding to simpler proofs (“9÷3=3 because 3×3=9” rather than “9÷3=3 because 3+3+3=9”).

Two studies examine factors leading one or the other of these strategies to predominate. First, general causal claims (e.g., ""Smoking causes cancer"") are evaluated predominantly using statistical evidence, whereas statistics is less preferred for specific claims (e.g., ""Smoking caused Jack’s cancer""). Second, social and biological causal claims are evaluated primarily through statistical evidence, whereas statistical evidence is deemed less relevant for evaluating physical causal claims. We argue for a pluralistic view of causal learning on which a multiplicity of causal concepts lead to distinct strategies for learning about causation.",>Samuel Johnson>Frank Keil,>Yale University>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0124/index.html

Sequential presentation of lineup members, in contrast to simultaneous presentation, has been posited to increase witness accuracy, though analyses based in Signal Detection Theory (SDT) have challenged these claims. A possible way to clarify the effect of presentation format on witness accuracy is to develop SDT-based measurement models, which characterise decision performance in terms of psychologically-relevant parameters, particularly discriminability and response bias. A model of the sequential lineup task was developed with a “first-above-criterion” decision rule, alongside a simultaneous model with a “maximum familiarity” decision rule. These models were fit to a corpus of data comparing simultaneous and sequential lineup performance. Results showed no difference in discriminability between the procedures and more conservative responding for the sequential lineup.

2017,Mechanisms of overharvesting in patch foraging,"In patch foraging problems, animals must choose to stick with a depleting resource or to search for a new, potentially more rewarding source. Many species of animals exhibit a tendency to stick with the depleting resource longer than is predicted by optimal foraging theory (Marginal Value Theorem; MVT). We attempted to determine the cognitive biases that underlie overharvesting in rats by characterizing rat foraging behavior in multiple foraging environments, and formally testing whether four separate cognitive biases – subjective costs, decreasing marginal utility for reward discounting of future reward, and ignoring post-reward delays – could explain rat foraging behavior. We found that, in some contexts, rats qualitatively follow predictions of MVT but overharvest, and all four biases could explain this behavior. In other contexts, rats deviated from predictions of MVT, and only one bias – in which rats ignore post-reward delays – could also explain these deviations of MVT.",>Gary Kane>Aaron Bornstein>Robert Wilson>Amitai Shenhav>Nathaniel Daw>Jonathan Cohen,>Princeton University>Princeton University>University of Arizona>Brown University>Princeton University>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0128/index.html
2017,Language-users choose short words in predictive contexts in an artificial language task,"Zipf (1935) observed that word length is inversely proportional to word frequency in the lexicon. He hypothesised that this universal feature was due to the Principle of Least Effort: language-users align form-meaning mappings so that the lexicon is optimally coded for efficient information transfer. However, word frequency is not the only reliable predictor of word length: Piantadosi et al. (2011) show that a word’s predictability in context is more strongly correlated with word length than frequency. Here, we present an artificial language study investigating the mechanisms that could give rise to this distribution. We find that participants are more likely to use an ambiguous short form in predictive contexts, and distinct long forms in surprising contexts, only when they are subject to the competing pressures to communicate accurately and efficiently. These results support the hypothesis that language-users are driven by a least-effort principle to align word length with information content.",>Jasmeen Kanwal>Kenny Smith>Jennifer Culbertson>Simon Kirby,">University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0129/index.html

Students engaged in problem-posing either with solution generation (where they generated problems and solutions to a novel situation) or problem-posing without solution generation (where they generated only problems) prior to learning a novel math concept. Problem-posing with solution generation prior to instruction resulted in significantly better conceptual knowledge, without any significant difference in procedural knowledge and transfer. These findings suggest that although solution generation prior to instruction plays a critical role in the development of conceptual understanding, and generating problems can further enhance transfer.",>Manu Kapur,">ETH Zurich, Switzerland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0130/index.html
2017,Comparing Individual and Collaborative Problem Solving in Environmental Search,"Collaborative spatial problem solving is an important yet not thoroughly examined task. Participants navigated individually and in dyads through virtual cities of varying complexity. They only saw the environment part visible from their current location from a bird’s eye view map perspective. We recorded missed target locations, overall trajectory length and search time per person until self-indicating whole coverage. Our results show a general increase in missed locations, trajectory length, and search time with the complexity of the environment. These increases differed due to individual and collaborative search. For complex, but not for simple environments individual participants navigated shorter distances, finished earlier, but also missed more target locations than when searching the same environments in collaboration. These results indicate that in complex environments collaborative search is less error prone than individual search, but takes longer. Such initial findings will constrain future theorizing about collaborative spatial problem solving.",>Franziska Keilmann>Stephan de La Rosa>Stephan Schwan>Ulrike Cress>Betty J Mohler>Heinrich H Bülthoff>Tobias Meilinger,>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics>Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien>Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0131/index.html

Yet language is typically transmitted by experts who adjust the input in ways that facilitates learning by novices, e.g. through child-directed speech. Using iterated language learning of binary auditory sequences, we explored how language change is affected by experts’ intention to teach the language to novices. Comparison between teaching chains and simple transmission chains revealed that teaching was associated with a greater rate of innovation which led to emergence of more expressive languages consisting of shorter signals. This is the first study to show that during cultural transmission, teaching can modify, and potentially optimise, functional characteristics of language.",>Vera Kempe>Kamil Cichon>Nicolas Gauvrit>Monica Tamariz,>Abertay University>Abertay University>Université Paris 8 & École Pratique des Hautes Études>Heriot-Watt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0132/index.html
2017,Dynamic Effects of Conceptual Combination on Semantic Network Structure,"The generative capacity of language entails an ability to flexibly combine concepts with each other. Conceptual combination can occur either by using an attribute of one concept to describe another (attributive combination) or by forming some relation between two concepts to create a new one (relational combination). Prior research has addressed whether common or distinct processes support these two putatively different types of combinations. We turn the question around and ask whether the consequences of these combination types on our conceptual system might differ, by comparing semantic memory networks before and after participants perform either attributive or relational conceptual combinations. We find a general effect on the semantic networks: the structure of network decreases after participants conceptually combine some of the concepts in the network. However, the relational combination manipulation has a greater effect. Furthermore, only the relational combination manipulation leads to an increase in the network’s connectivity.",>Yoed Kenett>Sharon Thompson-Schill,">University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States>University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0133/index.html
2017,The provenance of modal inference,"People reason about possibilities routinely, and reasoners can infer “modal” conclusions, i.e., conclusions that concern what's possible or necessary from premises that don't mention modality. For instance, given that Cullen was born in New York or Kentucky, it's intuitive to infer that it’s possible that Cullen was born in New York. Conventional logic does not apply to modal reasoning, and so logicians invented systems to capture valid modal inferences. But, none of them can explain the inference above. We posit a novel theory based on the idea that reasoners build mental models, i.e., sets of conjunctive possibilities, when they reason about sentential connectives such as ""and"", ""if"", and ""or"". The theory is implemented in a new computational process model of sentential reasoning. We show how its performance matches reasoners’ inferences in studies by Hinterecker et al. (2016). We conclude by discussing the theory in light of alternative accounts of reasoning.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Thomas Hinterecker>Philip Johnson-Laird,">Naval Research Laboratory>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen>Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0134/index.html

In the current study, we examined estimation of numerical and non-numerical quantities on a continuum using various psychophysical functions. Inconsistent with the proportion reasoning and measurement skills accounts, estimates of both numerical and non-numerical quantities were better predicted by the logarithmic-linear model than by cyclic power models. Furthermore, individual differences in the degree of logarithmic compression was highly correlated over tasks, whereas bias measures from competing models did not show such associations. These findings suggest that estimation of both numerical and non-numerical magnitude is processed via shared representation systems that are logarithmically or linearly constructed.",>Dan Kim>John Opfer,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0135/index.html
2017,Variables Involved in Selective Sustained Attention Development: Advances in Measurement,"Selective sustained attention (SSA) is an important cognitive process enabling everyday functioning and task performance by allowing us to: 1) choose components of our environment to process at the exclusion of others and 2) maintain focus on those components over time. Although SSA is known to undergo rapid and marked changes during the preschool and early primary school children years, there has been little behavioral data on these years due to a lack of child-appropriate testing paradigms. The TrackIt paradigm was recently developed to fill the previously existing measurement gap for SSA in these years. We analyzed errors that children (aged 3-7) make when performing TrackIt, to better understand factors driving improvement in performance over age. In addition, we manipulated parameters within TrackIt to vary demand on children’s SSA, and measured behavioral performance over age. Our results also help suggest appropriate parameter settings for calibrating TrackIt to different age groups.",>Jaeah Kim>Anna Vande Velde>Erik Thiessen>Anna Fisher,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0136/index.html
2017,Constructing Social Preferences From Anticipated Judgments: When Impartial Inequity is Fair and Why?,"Successful and repeated cooperation requires fairly sharing the spoils of joint endeavors. In addition to preferences about the outcome itself, allocators are also sensitive to the attributions others might make about them as a result of their choice. We develop a novel mathematical model where decision makers turn their capacity to infer latent desires and beliefs from the behavior of others towards themselves, anticipating the judgments others will make about them. Using this model we can construct a preference to be seen as impartial and integrate it with preferences for equitable and efficient outcomes. We test this model in two studies where anticipated attribution of impartiality is ambiguous: when one agent is more deserving than the other and when unbiased procedures for distribution are made available. This model explains both participants' judgments about the partiality of others and their decisions.",>Max Kleiman-Weiner>Alex Shaw>Josh Tenenbaum,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0137/index.html
2017,"Explaining Guides Learners Towards Perfect Patterns, Not Perfect Prediction","When learners explain to themselves as they encounter new information, they recruit a suite of processes that influence subsequent learning. One consequence is that learners are more likely to discover exceptionless rules that underlie what they are trying to explain. Here we investigate what it is about exceptionless rules that satisfies the demands of explanation. Are exceptions unwelcome because they lower predictive accuracy, or because they challenge some other explanatory ideal, such as simplicity and breadth? To compare these alternatives, we introduce a causally rich property explanation task in which exceptions to a general rule are either arbitrary or predictable. If predictive accuracy is sufficient to satisfy the demands of explanation, the introduction of a rule plus exception that supports perfect prediction should block the discovery of a more subtle but exceptionless rule. Across two experiments, we find that effects of explanation go beyond attaining perfect prediction.",>Elizabeth Kon>Tania Lombrozo,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0138/index.html
2017,Selective Information Sampling and the In-Group Heterogeneity Effect,"People often perceive their in-groups as more heterogeneous than their out-groups. We propose an information sampling explanation for this in-group heterogeneity effect. We analyze a model in which an agent forms beliefs and attitudes about social groups from her experience. Consistent with robust evidence from the social sciences, we assume that people are more likely to interact again with in-group members than with outgroup members. This implies that people obtain larger samples of information about in-groups than about out-groups. Because estimators of variability tend to be right-skewed, but less so when sample size is large, sampled in-group variability will tend to be higher than sampled out-group variability. This implies that even agents that process information correctly – even if they are naive intuitive statisticians – will be subject to the in-group heterogeneity effect. Our sampling mechanism complements existing explanations that rely on how information about in-group and out-group is processed.",>Elizaveta Konovalova>Gael Le Mens,">Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain>Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0139/index.html
2017,Exploring the decision dynamics of risky intertemporal choice,"Previous research on the effects of probability and delay on decision-making has focused on examining each dimension separately, and hence little is known about when these dimensions are combined into a single choice option. Importantly, we know little about the psychological processes underlying choice behavior with rewards that are both delayed and probabilistic. Using a process-tracing experimental design, we monitored information acquisition patterns and processing strategies. We found that probability and delay are processed sequentially and evaluations of risky delayed prospects are dependent on the sequence of information acquisition. Among choice strategies, directly comparing the values of each dimension (i.e., dimension-wise processing) appears to be most favored by participants. Our results provide insights into the psychological plausibility of existing computational models and make suggestions for the development of a process model for risky intertemporal choice.",>Emmanouil Konstantinidis>Don van Ravenzwaaij>Ben R.

In the present study, we examine whether humans are able to predict (1) the resting geometry of sand pouring from a funnel and (2) the dynamics of three substances---liquid, sand, and rigid balls---flowing past obstacles into two basins. Participants' judgments in each experiment are consistent with simulation results from the intuitive substance engine (ISE) model, which employs a Material Point Method (MPM) simulator with noisy inputs. The ISE outperforms ground-truth physical models in each situation, as well as two data-driven models. The results reported herein expand on previous work proposing human use of mental simulation in physical reasoning and demonstrate human proficiency in predicting the dynamics of sand, a substance that is less common in daily life than liquid or rigid objects.",>James Kubricht>Yixin Zhu>Chenfanfu Jiang>Demetri Terzopoulos>Song-Chun Zhu>Hongjing Lu,">UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA>UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0141/index.html

Sports offer exquisite examples of this dynamic interplay requiring decision making and other perceptual-cognitive skills to adjust individual decisions to the team self-organization and vice-versa. Considering players of a team as periodic phase oscillators, synchrony analyses can be used to model the coordination of a team. Nonetheless, a main limitation of current models is that collective behavior is context independent. In other words, players of a team can be highly synchronized without this corresponding to a meaningful coordination dynamics relevant to the context of the game. Considering these issues, the aim of this study was to develop a method of analysis sensitive to the context for evidence-based measures of team cognition.",>Maurici A. López-Felip>Tehran J.

2017,More Siblings Means Lower Input Quality in Early Language Development,"Previous research has suggested that first-born infants acquire words faster than their later-born peers (Berglund et al., 2005), but may have some disadvantages in other aspects of syntactic and socio-communicative development (e.g. Hoff, 2006). Here we analyzed infants’ early lexical development alongside their caregiver input from 6-18 months, in relation to how many siblings they have. We find that having more siblings (rather than being first- or later-born) has a gradient and negative relationship with infants’ language development. This affect appears to be manifested in caregiver input: across three different measures of input quality/quantity, disadvantages were found for infants with more siblings. Having a larger number of siblings diminished the quality of the input and led to slower overall lexical development.

2017,Uncovering visual priors in spatial memory using serial reproduction,"Visual memory can be understood as an inferential process that combines noisy information about the world with knowledge drawn from experience. Biases can arise during encoding of information from the outside world into internal representations, or during retrieval. In this work, we use the method of serial reproduction, in which information is passed along a chain of participants who try to recreate what they observed. We apply this method to the study of visual perception in the context of spatial memory biases for the remembered position of dots inside different geometric shapes. We present the results of non-parametric kernel density estimation of the end result of serial reproduction to model visual biases. We confirm previous findings, and show that memory biases revealed with our method are often more intricate and complex than what had previously been reported, suggesting that serial reproduction can be effective for studying perceptual priors.",>Thomas Langlois>Nori Jacoby>Jordan Suchow>Thomas Griffiths,">UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>Columbia University>UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0144/index.html
2017,A core-affect model of decision making in simple and complex tasks,"When it comes to decision making, the dominant view suggests that engaging in a detailed analytical thought process is more beneficial than deciding based on one’s feelings. However, there seems to be a tradeoff, as the complexity and amount of elements on which to base the decision increases, decisions based on affect seem to be more accurate than decisions based on a thorough analytical process in specific contexts. In those last cases, an affective modulation of memory may help to make better decisions in complex tasks that exceed human’s limited cognitive capacities. Some dual process accounts, oppose a cognitive route to an affective route. We propose an explanation of the dynamics and interaction of cognitive (i.e., explicit) and affective (i.e., implicit) encoding and retrieval of elements in memory, using a unified theory based on core affect (Russell, 2003), in the shape of a cognitive model in the ACT-R cognitive architecture.",>Othalia Larue>Alexander Hough>Ion Juvina,>Wright State University>Wright State University>Wright State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0145/index.html

Participants judged generic majority characteristic statements like tigers have stripes or statements with universal quantifiers that have different sensitivity to context (‘all’, ‘all the’, ‘each’) preceded by one of three levels of context: a) neutral, where the information in the context does not interact with the truth value of the critical statement, b) contradictory, where it presents an exception which should rule out a universally quantified statement, and c) supportive.

In the context of experience-based risky choice, we find the simultaneous underweighting of rare events in choice and their overestimation in probability judgement.

To answer this question, we formalized the bounded optimal decision process as the solution to a meta-level Markov decision process whose actions are costly computations. We approximated the optimal solution and evaluated its predictions against human choice behavior in the Mouselab paradigm, which is widely used to study decision strategies. Our computational method rediscovered well-known heuristic strategies and the conditions under which they are used, as well as novel heuristics.

One approach to characterizing stimulus integrality is through a set of speeded categorization tasks most closely associated with the work of Wendell Garner. These tasks demonstrate that integral dimensions result in marked speed up or slow down in responding when there is correlated or irrelevant variation, respectively, compared with a baseline task. Little, Wang & Nosofsky (2016) recently found that the slow down or interference can be largely explained by a reduction in the number of direct repetitions in a modified Garner filtering task. In this paper, we examine a large sample of subjects tested on either separable or integral dimensions to determine the extent of and individual differences in the overall and sequential effects in the standard Garner tasks.",>Deborah Lin>Daniel Little,">The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia>The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0150/index.html

Recent reports showed that verb bias can be altered by new linguistic experience. We investigated the mechanisms underlying this verb bias learning or adaptation. Specifically, we asked whether verb bias learning, like abstract syntactic priming, is driven by error-based implicit learning. We report three experiments in which we altered the biases of familiar dative verbs in children’s and adults’ sentence production, via training trials that induced participants to produce each verb consistently in either double-object or prepositional-object dative structures. Participants’ syntactic choices in later test trials reflected the expected adaptation of verb bias to the training experience. In addition, the magnitude of the training effect varied with the likelihood of each sentence structure and with pre-existing verb bias: Unexpected verb-structure combinations resulted in larger training effects, suggesting the operation of error-based implicit learning.",>Yi Lin>Cynthia Fisher,>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0151/index.html

However, data from several recent studies has shown the opposite trend: an increase in iconicity as the result of repeated interactions. Here, we discuss whether signals may become less or more iconic as a result of the modality used to produce them. We review several recent experimental results before presenting new data from multi-modal signals, where visual input creates audio feedback. Our results show that the growth in iconicity present in the audio information may come at a cost to iconicity in the visual information. Our results have implications for how we think about and measure iconicity in artificial signalling experiments. Further, we discuss how iconicity in real world speech may stem from auditory, kinetic or visual information, but iconicity in these different modalities may conflict.",>Hannah Little>Marcus Perlman>Kerem Eryılmaz,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1050 Brussels, Belgium",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0152/index.html

Here, we explore the thesis that human infants solve this problem by building a mental model of action planning, taking into account the costs of acting and the rewards actions bring. Consistent with this thesis, we found that 10-month-old infants, after viewing an agent approach two objects equally often, inferred that the agent preferred the object whose attainment required a costlier action. Infants’ responses generalized across changes in perceptual variables that distinguished one action from another (e.g. path length, angle of incline), suggesting that an abstract cost metric based on force or effort supported their judgments. These findings suggest that infants’ knowledge about agents may be expressed as a generative model for action planning, which can then be inverted to identify the probable hidden causes for observed actions.",>Shari Liu>Tomer Ullman>Josh Tenenbaum>Elizabeth Spelke,>Harvard University>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0153/index.html

2017,Social Network Limits Language Complexity,"Natural languages vary widely in the degree to which they make use of hierarchical composition in their grammars, in particular, the degree to which syntactic versus morphologi- cal means of composition are utilized. Languages historically spoken in small communities develop much deeper levels of morphological embedding than those spoken by larger groups, an observation confirmed by a statistical analysis of the World Atlas of Language Structures. However, beyond population alone, social networks change in topological structure as they grow, and it may be the pattern of connectivity rather than number of speakers driving these differences. To examine mechanistically this connection between social and linguistic structure, we propose an agent-based model of grammatical change using complex network methods. We identify global transitivity as a physical parameter of social networks critical for developing morphological structure, and hubs associated with scale-free networks as inhibitory, encouraging syntactic composition instead.",>Matt Lou-Magnuson>Luca Onnis,">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore>Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0155/index.html

However, how does learning such relationships influence the memory representations of individual objects? Here we used a false memory paradigm to examine the impact of statistical learning on memory representations of individual objects. Observers were exposed to a temporal sequence (Experiment 1) or spatial arrays (Experiment 2) of objects which contained object pairs (e.g., A-B). In a subsequent recognition phase, observers viewed a sequence or an array containing only one member of the original pair, and judged whether either the presented object or the missing object in the original pair was present. We found that statistical learning not only sharpened the detection of the presented object, but also induced a false memory of the missing object. This reveals a novel consequence of statistical learning: learning of regularities can create illusory memories.",>Yu Luo>Jiaying Zhao,">University of British Columbia , Vancouver, BC, Canada>University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0156/index.html

But when the visual signal also contains information about the language source -- as in the case of written text or sign language -- how do we decide where to look? Here, we hypothesize that eye movements during language comprehension represent an adaptive response. Using two case studies, we show that, compared to English-learners, young signers delayed their gaze shifts away from a language source, were more accurate with these shifts, and produced a smaller proportion of nonlanguage-driven shifts (E1). Next, we present a well-controlled, confirmatory experiment, showing that English-speaking adults produced fewer nonlanguage-driven shifts when processing printed text compared to spoken language (E2). Together, these data suggest that people adapt to the value of seeking different information in order to increase the chance of rapid and accurate language understanding.",>Kyle MacDonald>Aviva Blonder>Virginia Marchman>Anne Fernald>Michael Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, U.S.>Oberlin College>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0157/index.html

The current study considers whether preschoolers are sensitive to probable differences in individuals’ competence when allocating roles. We found that 3.5- to 5.5-year-olds use relative competence, as indexed by the age of their intended partner, to determine who should do the harder and easier of two tasks in a cooperative interaction. A second experiment demonstrated that children allocate roles differently in a competitive context.

2017,Intuitive psychophysics: Children’s exploratory play quantitatively tracks the discriminability of alternative hypotheses,"Studies suggest that children’s exploratory behavior is sensitive to uncertainty; however, few have approached this with sufficient precision to model quantitatively. Across three experiments, children (mean age=70 months) were asked to shake a box to identify which of two sets of marbles, differing in numerosity, were hidden inside. The sets’ numerosities varied in their discriminability indices – the degree to which listeners can distinguish the sets based on the acoustic information generated. The time children spent shaking the box varied systematically with the discriminability of the alternative hypotheses they were asked to distinguish, even though they heard only one set for each contrast. This suggests that children represent the uncertainty in their own perceptual discrimination abilities (an ability we refer to as an intuitive psychophysics) and their exploratory behavior is precisely calibrated to their degree of uncertainty about alternative hypotheses that might explain unobserved causes of perceptual data.",>Rachel Magid>Max Siegel>Josh Tenenbaum>Laura Schulz,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0159/index.html
2017,Leveraging Response Consistency within Individuals to Improve Group Accuracy for Rank-Ordering Problems,"Averaging the estimates of a number of individuals has been shown to produce an estimate that is generally more accurate than those of the individuals themselves. Similarly, averaging responses from a single individual can also lead to a more accurate answer. How can we best combine estimates within and between individuals to create an accurate group estimate? We report empirical results from a general knowledge rank-ordering experiment and demonstrate that individuals that provide more consistent answers across repeated elicitations are also more accurate. We develop a consistency weighting heuristic and show that repeated elicitations within an individual can be used to improve group accuracy. We also develop a Thurstonian cognitive model which assumes a direct link between the process that explains the accuracy of an individual and response consistency and show how the model can infer accurate group answers.",>Brent Miller>Mark Steyvers,">Vanderbilt University>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0160/index.html
2017,A Rational Constructivist Account of the Characteristic-to-Defining Shift,"A widely observed phenomenon in children's word-extensions and generalizations is the characteristic-to-defining shift, whereby young children initially generalize words based on typical properties and gradually transition into generalizing words using abstract, logical information. In this paper, we propose a statistically principled model of conceptual development grounded in the trade-off between simplicity and fit to the data. We run our model based on informant-provided family trees and the real-life characteristic features of people on those trees. We demonstrate that the characteristic-to-defining shift does not necessarily depend on discrete change in representation or processes. Instead, the shift could fall out naturally from statistical inference over conceptual hypotheses. Our model finds that the shift occurs even when abstract logical relations are present from the outset of learning as long as characteristic features are informative but imperfect in their ability to capture the underlying concept to be learned---a property of our elicited features.",>Francis Mollica>Shirlene Wade>Steve Piantadosi,">University of Rochester>University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States>University of Rochester, Rochester, NY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0161/index.html
2017,An incremental information-theoretic buffer supports sentence processing,"People have the capability to process text three times faster than they would naturally read it, yet many current theories of sentence processing rely on natural reading times as a proxy for processing difficulty. How can people read material so quickly in spite of information processing limitations suggested by sentence processing theories? One possibility is that surprisal effects on reading time, the hallmark of processing difficulty under sentence processing theories, might arise from perceptual processing, implying no relation between surprisal and sentence processing difficulty. In this paper, we conducted a novel self-paced rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiment, which controlled perceptual processes to probe for sentence processing related surprisal effects. We further tested how readers might compensate for information processing limits during RSVP. We find support for sentence processing related surprisal effects, the pattern of which is consistent with a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) buffer model.",>Francis Mollica>Steve Piantadosi,">University of Rochester>University of Rochester, Rochester, NY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0162/index.html
2017,Different processes for reading words learned before and after onset of literacy,"Learning to read has a substantial effect on the representations of spoken and meaning forms of words. In this paper we assess literacy effects beyond representational changes, focusing on adaptations to the architecture of the reading system that maps between these representations. We present a connectionist model of reading that predicted distinct processing of pre- and post-literacy acquired words. For reading for meaning, words learned prior to literacy were processed more indirectly via phonological representations, whereas for post-literacy acquired words, processing was more direct along the orthography to semantics pathway. This more computationally intensive route was prioritised because indirect phonology to semantics mappings were unavailable. Such an effect was less apparent for naming, because learning direct orthography to phonology mappings is less computationally intensive. These results were confirmed in an analysis of naming and lexical decision behavioural data. The effect of literacy onset remains an observable artefact in adult reading.",>Padraic Monaghan>Ya-Ning Chang>Stephen Welbourne,>Lancaster University>Lancaster University>Manchester University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0163/index.html
2017,Multiple variable cues in the environment promote accurate and robust word learning,"Learning how words refer to aspects of the environment is a complex task, but one that is supported by numerous cues within the environment which constrain the possibilities for matching words to their intended referents. In this paper we tested the predictions of a computational model of multiple cue integration for word learning, that predicted variation in the presence of cues provides an optimal learning situation. In a cross-situational learning task with adult participants, we varied the reliability of presence of distributional, prosodic, and gestural cues. We found that the best learning occurred when cues were often present, but not always. The effect of variability increased the salience of individual cues for the learner, but resulted in robust learning that was not vulnerable to individual cues’ presence or absence. Thus, variability of multiple cues in the language-learning environment provided the optimal circumstances for word learning.",>Padraic Monaghan>James Brand>Rebecca Frost>Gemma Taylor,>Lancaster University>Lancaster University>Lancaster University>Salford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0164/index.html
2017,The ecological rationality of children’s option generation and decision making,"In everyday life, before deciding what to do, one has to think about what could be done. We investigate option generation from a developmental perspective, testing the predictions of the Take-The-First-heuristic (TTF). Moreover, we examine the influence of time limitation on decision-making processes. Using soccer as a testbed, 6- to 13-year-old children (N = 97) were tested in a video-based option-generation paradigm. Children’s performance was aligned with predictions of TTF: Children generated a mean of 2.21 options, did so in a meaningful way and selected the first as final option in 74%. With shorter time, children generated fewer and higher quality options, selected better options and more often the first option as final decision. Further, with age, an increase of the number of options generated and an increase in quality of the final decisions emerged. This age effect was more pronounced with shorter time. Implications for real-life decision-making are discussed.",>Lisa Musculus>Azzurra Ruggeri>Markus Raab>Babett Lobinger,">Institute of Psychology, Department of Performance Psychology, German Sport University Cologne, Germany>MPRG iSearch, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>Institute of Psychology, Department of Performance Psychology, German Sport University Cologne, Germany;London South Bank University, United Kingdom>Institute of Psychology, Department of Performance Psychology, German Sport University Cologne, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0165/index.html
2017,Multitasking Capability Versus Learning Efficiency in Neural Network Architectures,"One of the most salient and well-recognized features of human goal-directed behavior is our limited ability to conduct multiple demanding tasks at once. Previous work has identified overlap between task processing pathways as a limiting factor for multitasking performance in neural architectures. This raises an important question: insofar as shared representation between tasks introduces the risk of cross-talk and thereby limitations in multitasking, why would the brain prefer shared task representations over separate representations across tasks? We seek to answer this question by introducing formal considerations and neural network simulations in which we contrast the multitasking limitations that shared task representations incur with their benefits for task learning. Our results suggest that neural network architectures face a fundamental tradeoff between learning efficiency and multitasking performance in environments with shared structure between tasks.",>Sebastian Musslick>Andrew Saxe>Kayhan Ozcimder>Biswadip Dey>Greg Henselman>Jonathan Cohen,">Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA>Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA>Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA>University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA>Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0166/index.html
2017,Analogical Inferences in Causal Systems,"Analogical and causal reasoning theories both seek to explain patterns of inductive inference. Researchers have claimed that reasoning scenarios incorporating aspects of both analogical comparison and causal thinking necessitate a new model of inductive inference (Holyoak, Lee, & Lu, 2010; Lee & Holyoak, 2008). This paper takes an opposing position, arguing that features of analogical models make correct claims about inference patterns found among causal analogies, including analogies with both generative and preventative relations. Experiment 1 demonstrates that analogical inferences for these kinds of causal systems can be explained by alignment of relational structure, including higher-order relations. Experiment 2 further demonstrates that inferences strengthened by matching higher-order relations are not guided by the transfer of probabilistic information about a cause from base to target. We conclude that causal analogies behave like analogies in general—analogical mapping provides candidate inferences which can then be reasoned about in the target.",>Matthew Myers>Dedre Gentner,">Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States>Northwestern University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0167/index.html

Analysis on mental structured representations indicates that this transfer may act differently depending upon structural and perceptual features of the priming task. Two hundred eight participants were assigned to three experimental groups where they received a structure-priming,tested once and afterwards they received a perceptual-priming and tested again. As predicted, the effect of structure-priming was found across conditions whereas the effect of perceptual-priming (a six-second animation) was detected only in subjects with high levels of cognitive reflectiveness. These individual differences are interpreted as that only highly reflective subjects were able to process visuospatial cues in the animation and to extract their structural features, hence activating relational concepts that influenced their interpretations of subsequent tasks.",>Jairo A.

This question is often studied experimentally and computationally via iterated learning, in which participants learn from previous participants in a chain. Much research in this area builds on mathematical analyses suggesting that iterated learning chains converge to people’s priors. We present three simulation studies suggesting that when the population of learners is heterogeneous, the behavior of the chain is systematically distorted by the learners with the most extreme biases. We discuss implications for the use of iterated learning as a methodological tool and for the processes that might have shaped cultural products in the real world.",>Daniel Navarro>Amy Perfors>Arthur Kary>Scott Brown>Chris Donkin,>University of New South Wales>University of Adelaide>University of New South Wales>University of Newcastle>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0169/index.html

We take a computational approach to investigate how the information present during each observation in a cross-situational framework can affect the overall acquisition of word meanings. We do so by formulating various in-the-moment learning mechanisms that are sensitive to different statistics of the environment, such as counts and conditional probabilities. Each mechanism introduces a unique source of competition or mutual exclusivity bias to the model; the mechanism that maximally uses the model's knowledge of word meanings performs the best. Moreover, the gap between this mechanism and others is amplified in more challenging learning scenarios, such as learning from few examples.",>Aida Nematzadeh>Barend Beekhuizen>Shanshan Huang>Suzanne Stevenson,">University of California, Berkeley>University of Toronto>University of Toronto>University of Toronto",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0170/index.html
2017,"Evaluating Vector-Space Models of Word Representation, or,The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Counting Words Near Other Words","Vector-space models of semantics represent words as continuously-valued vectors and measure similarity based on the distance or angle between those vectors. Such representations have become increasingly popular due to the recent development of methods that allow them to be efficiently estimated from very large amounts of data. However, the idea of relating similarity to distance in a spatial representation has been criticized by cognitive scientists, as human similarity judgments have many properties that are inconsistent with the geometric constraints that a distance metric must obey. We show that two popular vector-space models, Word2Vec and GloVe, are unable to capture certain critical aspects of human word association data as a consequence of these constraints. However, a probabilistic topic model estimated from a relatively small curated corpus qualitatively reproduces the asymmetric patterns seen in the human data.",>Aida Nematzadeh>Stephan C.

2017,"Listeners integrate speech, gesture, and discourse structure to interpret the temporal structure of complex events","Human communication has a remarkable capacity to describe events that occurred elsewhere and at other times. In particular, when describing complex narratives, speakers must communicate temporal structure using a mixture of words (e.g., “after”), gestures (e.g., pointing rightward for a later event), and discourse structure (e.g., mentioning earlier events first). How do listeners integrate these sources of temporal information to make sense of complex narratives? In two experiments, we systematically manipulated gesture, speech, and order-of-mention to investigate their respective impacts on comprehension of temporal structure. Gesture had a significant effect on interpretations of temporal order. This influence of gesture, however, was weaker than the influence of both speech and order-of-mention. Indeed, in some cases, order-of-mention trumped explicit descriptions in speech; for instance, if ‘earlier’ events were mentioned second, they were sometimes thought to have occurred second. Listeners integrate multiple sources of information to interpret what happened when.",>Andrea Nishimi>Esther Walker>Benjamin Bergen>Tyler Marghetis,">UC San Diego>UC San Diego>UC San Diego>Indiana University, Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0172/index.html
2017,Dynamics of Affordance Actualization,"The actualization of affordances can often be accomplished in numerous, equifinal ways. For instance, an individual could discard an item in a rubbish bin by walking over and dropping it, or by throwing it from a distance. The aim of the current study was to investigate the behavioral dynamics associated with such metastability using a ball-to-bin transportation task. Using time-interval between sequential ball-presentation as a control parameter, participants transported balls from a pickup location to a drop-off bin 9m away. A high degree of variability in task-actualization was expected and found, and the Cusp Catatrophe model was used to understand how this behavioral variability emerged as a function of hard (time interval) and soft (e.g. motivation) task dynamic constraints. Simulations demonstrated that this two parameter state manifold could capture the wide range of participant behaviors, and explain how these behaviors naturally emerge in an under-constrained task context.",>Patric Nordbeck>Laura Soter>Rachel Kallen>Anthony Chemero>Michael Richardson,">University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>Carleton College>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0173/index.html

To address this difference, the current experiment examines and attempts to disentangle the influence of two recognition judgment sources (from within an experiment and from an individual’s prior life experiences) upon two different recognition judgments. By presenting participants with a set of related stimuli that vary naturally in environmental occurrence and by manipulating exposure within an experimental context, this experiment allows for a broader and more ecologically valid assessment of recognition memory. Contrasting with the typical word-frequency effect, the results reveal an overall bias to judge high-frequency items as studied on an episodic recognition test. Additionally, the results underscore the role of context by showing that a single study exposure increases the probability that individuals will judge stimuli as presented outside the laboratory.",>Justin Olds>Julian Marewski,>University of Lausanne>University of Lausanne,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0174/index.html

2017,Speakers’ gestures predict the meaning and perception of iconicity in signs,"Sign languages stand out in that there is high prevalence of conventionalised linguistic forms that map directly to their referent (i.e., iconic). Hearing adults show low performance when asked to guess the meaning of iconic signs suggesting that their iconic features are largely inaccessible to them. However, it has not been investigated whether speakers’ gestures, which also share the property of iconicity, may assist non-signers in guessing the meaning of signs. Results from a pantomime generation task (Study 1) show that speakers’ gestures exhibit a high degree of systematicity, and share different degrees of form overlap with signs (full, partial, and no overlap). Study 2 shows that signs with full and partial overlap are more accurately guessed and are assigned higher iconicity ratings than signs with no overlap.

The cost of cognitive control is parsed into an intensity cost which encapsulates how much additional input information is required so as to get the specified response, and an interaction cost which encapsulates the level of interference between individual processes in a network. We develop a formal relationship between the probability of successful execution of desired processes and the control signals (additive control biases). This relationship is also used to specify optimal control policies to achieve a desired probability of activation for processes. We observe that there are boundary cases when finding such control policies which leads us to introduce the interaction cost. We show that the interaction cost is influenced by the relative strengths of individual processes, as well as the directionality of the underlying competition between processes.",>Kayhan Ozcimder>Biswadip Dey>Sebastian Musslick>Giovanni Petri>Nesreen K.

Recent work has sought to formalize this observation in the context of information theory, which establishes a limit on communicative efficiency called channel capacity. In this paper, I first show that the compositional structure of natural language prevents natural language communication from getting close to the channel capacity, but that a different limit, which incorporates probability in context, may be achievable. Next, I present two corpus studies in three typologically-diverse languages that provide evidence that languages change over time towards the achievable limit. These results suggest that natural language optimizes for efficiency over time, and does so in a way that is appopriate for compositional codes.",>John Pate,">The University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0178/index.html

In the current work, we present a low-support, interactive discovery interface for learning complex relational categories. The platform, which allows learners to make modifications to exemplars and see the corresponding effects on category membership, holds the potential to augment relational learning by facilitating self-directed comparisons that explore what the learner does not yet understand. We compared interactive training to identification training and assessed learners on their ability to generalize to novel exemplars from the learning domain. Although identification learners were provided with many more examples of the category during training, interactive learners demonstrated enhanced generalization accuracy and more specific knowledge of category membership constraints. Overall, the results show interactive training to be a powerful tool for supplementing and refining category knowledge. We conclude with implications of these findings and promising future directions.",>John Patterson>David Landy>Kenneth Kurtz,">Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, United States>Indiana University>Binghamton University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0179/index.html

The longitudinal data include a span of six observations of 35 children-parent dyads in the same semi-structured activity. Our findings show that children’s speech initially has a high proportion of iconic words, and over time, these words become diluted by an increase of arbitrary words. Parents’ speech is also initially high in iconic words, with a decrease in the proportion of iconic words over time – in this case driven by the use of fewer iconic words. The level and development of iconicity are related to individual differences in the children’s cognitive skills. Our findings fit with the hypothesis that iconicity facilitates early word learning and may play an important role in learning to produce new words.",>Marcus Perlman>Riccardo Fusaroli>Deborah Fein>Letitia Naigles,>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Aarhus University>University of Conneticut>University of Connecticut,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0180/index.html

Shepard's account is based on a rational Bayesian model of generalization, providing an answer to the question of why such a law should emerge. Extending this account to explain how humans use multiple examples to make better generalizations requires an additional assumption, called the size principle: hypotheses that pick out fewer objects should make a larger contribution to generalization. The degree to which this principle warrants similarly law-like status is far from conclusive. Typically, evaluating this principle has not been straightforward, requiring additional assumptions. We present a new method for evaluating the size principle that is more direct, and apply this method to a diverse array of datasets.

Moreover, we further substantiate the psychological plausibility of our approach by an experiment (N = 60).

2017,Causation and norms of proper functioning: Counterfactuals are (still) relevant,"Causal judgments are well-known to be sensitive to violations of both moral and statistical norms. There is ongoing discussion as to whether both effects are best explained through changes in the relevance of counterfactual possibilities, or if moral norm violations should be independently explained through a potential polysemy in the word 'cause'. In support of the latter view, recent work has pointed out that moral norm violations affect judgments of agents, but not inanimate objects, and that their effects are moderated by agents' knowledge states. We advance this debate by demonstrating that judgments of counterfactual relevance exhibit precisely the same patterns, and that judgments of inanimate objects are highly sensitive to whether the object violated a prescriptive norm by malfunctioning. We then demonstrate that direct (non-moral) interventions on the the relevance of counterfactual alternatives affect causal judgments in precisely the same way as functional and moral norm violations.",>Jonathan Phillips>Jonathan Kominsky,>Harvard University>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0183/index.html

One use for deep learning is in language acquisition where it is useful to know if a linguistic phenomenon can be learned through domain-general means. To assess whether unsupervised deep learning is appropriate, we first pose a smaller question: Can unsupervised neural networks apply linguistic rules productively, using them in novel situations? We draw from the literature on determiner/noun productivity by training an unsupervised, autoencoder network measuring its ability to combine nouns with determiners. Our simple autoencoder creates combinations it has not previously encountered and produces a degree of overlap matching adults. While this preliminary work does not provide conclusive evidence for productivity, it warrants further investigation with more complex models.

2017,Opinion Cascades and Echo-Chambers in Online Networks: A Proof of Concept Agent-Based Model,"In online networks, the polarization of opinions (e.g., regarding presidential elections or referenda) has been associated with the creation of “echo-chambers” of like-minded peers, secluded from those of contrary viewpoints. Previous work has commonly attributed such phenomena to self-regarding preferences (e.g., confirmation bias), individual differences, and the pre-dispositions of users, with clusters forming over repeated interactions. The present work provides a proof of concept Agent-Based Model that demonstrates online networks are susceptible to echo-chambers from a single opinion cascade, due to the spatiotemporal order induced by lateral transmission. This susceptibility is found to vary as a function of degree of interconnectivity and opinion strength. Critically, such effects are found despite globally proportionate levels of opinions, equally rational agents (i.e. absent conformity, confirmation bias or pre-disposition architecture), and prior to cyclical interactions.

We present a formal framework for studying time allocation between these two types of activities, and ex- plore (optimal) behavior in both one-shot and dynamic ver- sions of the problem. In the one-shot version, we illustrate the striking discontinuous relation between people’s skill and opti- mal time allocation to the make-or-break task. In the dynamic version, we formulate both fully rational and boundedly ra- tional strategies, both defined by a giving up threshold, which adaptively dictates when one should cease pursuit of the make- or-break goal.

2017,A computational decomposition of task-irrelevant perceptual learning,"Change in motion discrimination was assessed after seven days training on a rapid serial visual presentation training task, which included exposure to below-threshold coherent motion that was irrelevant to the task the participant was involved in. Post-training, participants had improved sensitivity for supra-threshold motion discrimination, which was specific to the direction exposed during training. A computational decomposition of the effect shows that the improvement is a combination of (i) an increase in rate at which participants accumulate evidence for the direction to which they were exposed and (ii) a decrease in their criterion for a response. Together with these differences (consistent across participants) other cognitive processes vary non-systematically between the pre-test and the post-test session making an analysis only based on accuracy or reaction times potentially misleading.

2017,Inferential Pitfalls in Decoding Neural Representations,"A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is to decipher the representational schemes of the brain. A recent class of decoding algorithms for fMRI data, stimulus-feature-based encoding models, is becoming increasingly popular for inferring the dimensions of neural representational spaces from stimulus-feature spaces. We argue that such inferences are not always valid, because decoding can occur even if the neural representational space and the stimulus-feature space use different representational schemes. This can happen when there is a systematic mapping between them. In a simulation, we successfully decoded the binary representation of numbers from their decimal features. Since binary and decimal number systems use different representations, we cannot conclude that the binary representation encodes decimal features. The same argument applies to the decoding of neural patterns from stimulus-feature spaces and we urge caution in inferring the nature of the neural code from such methods. We discuss ways to overcome these inferential limitations.",>Vencislav Popov>Markus Ostarek>Caitlin Tenison,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0188/index.html

Participants performed a continuous associative recognition task in which they had to discriminate between new, old and recombined word pairs. Participants made more false alarms and responded more slowly to lures (TABLE CLOTH) that were relationally similar to studied pairs (FLOOR CARPET). RTs and false alarms for lures increased linearly as the number of previously studied different exemplars of the relation increased (e.g., 0 to 4 previous exemplars). The RLE effect was stronger for relations that were represented by exemplars that were more typical of the relation. These results suggest that semantic relations exist as independent representations in LTM, and that during associative recognition these representations can be a spurious source of familiarity. The RLE has implications for models of semantic and episodic memory, unitization in associative recognition, analogical reasoning, and constructive memory research.",>Vencislav Popov>Penka Hristova,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>New Bulgarian University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0189/index.html
2017,Target-to-distractor similarity can help visual search performance,"We found an unexpected positive effect of target-to-distractor similarity (TD) in a visual search task, despite overwhelming evidence in the literature that TD similarity hurts visual search performance. Participants with no prior knowledge of Chinese performed 9 hour-long sessions over 4 weeks, where they had to find a briefly presented target character among a set of distractors. At the beginning of the experiment, TD similarity hurt performance, but the effect reversed during the first session and remained positive throughout the remaining sessions. We present a simple connectionist model that accounts for that reversal of TD similarity effects on visual search and we discuss possible theoretical explanations.",>Vencislav Popov>Lynne Reder,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0190/index.html
2017,Timing Time: Why Early Vision is Cognitively Impenetrable,"Newen and Vetter (2016) argue that cognitive penetration (CP) of perceptual experience is the most possible account of the evidence. They target both the weak impenetrability thesis that only some early visual processes are cognitively impenetrable (CI), and the strong impenetrability thesis that all perceptual processes are CI. Since I agree that perceptual processing as a whole is CP, I will concentrate on their arguments against the weak CI thesis. In attacking weak CI, the authors take aim at Raftopoulos’ arguments supporting the CI of early vision. Their main argument comes from studies that, Newen and Vetter think, show that early vision is CP by demonstrating the existence of cognitive effects on early vision. I examine the same empirical evidence that Newen and Vatter discuss and argue this same evidence strongly supports the view that early vision is CI.",>Athanassios Raftopoulos,>University of Cyprus,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0191/index.html
2017,The Wason Selection task: A Meta-Analysis,"In Wason’s selection task, participants select whichever of four cards could provide evidence about the truth or falsity of a conditional rule. As our meta-analysis of hundreds of experiments corroborates, participants tend to overlook one of the cards that could falsify the rule. 15 distinct theories aim to explain this phenomenon and others, but many of them presuppose that cards are selected independently of one another. We show that this assumption is false: Shannon’s entropy for selections is reliably redundant in comparison with those of 10,000 simulated experiments using the same four individual probabilities for each real experiment. This result rules out those theories presupposing independent selections. Of the remaining theories, only two predict the frequencies of selections, one (due to Johnson-Laird & Wason, 1970a) provides a better fit to the experimental data than the other (due to Klauer et al., 2007). We discuss the implications of these results.",>Marco Ragni>Ilir Kola>Phil Johnson-Laird,">University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg>Princeton University, New York University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0192/index.html
2017,Mental Algorithms in the Historical Emergence of Word Meanings,"Words frequently acquire new senses, but the mental process that underlies the historical emergence of these senses is often opaque. Many have suggested that word meanings develop in non-arbitrary ways, but no attempt has been made to formalize these proposals and test them against historical data at scale. We propose that word meaning extension should reflect a drive towards cognitive economy. We test this proposal by exploring a family of computational models that predict the evolution of word senses, evaluated against a large digitized lexicon that dates back 1000 years in English language history. Our findings suggest that word meanings not only extend in predictable ways, but also that they do so following an historical path that tends to minimize cognitive cost - through a process of nearest-neighbor chaining. Our work contributes a formal approach to reverse-engineering mental algorithms of the human lexicon.",>Christian Ramiro>Barbara Malt>Mahesh Srinivasan>Yang Xu,>UC Berkeley>Lehigh University>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0193/index.html
2017,A cognitive analysis of deception without lying,"When the interests of interlocutors are not aligned, either party may wish to avoid truthful disclosure. A sender wishing to conceal the truth from a receiver may lie by providing false information, mislead by actively encouraging the receiver to reach a false conclusion, or simply be uninformative. Lying entails moral and other hazards, such as detection and its consequences, and is thus often avoided. We focus here on the latter two strategies, arguably more pernicious and prevalent, but not without their own drawbacks. We argue and show in two studies that when choosing between these options, senders consider the level of suspicion likely to be exercised on the part of the receiver and how much truth must be revealed in order to mislead. Extending Bayesian models of cooperative communication to include higher level inference regarding the helpfulness of the sender leads to insight into the strategies employed in non-cooperative contexts.",>Keith Ransom>Wouter Voorspoels>Amy Perfors>Daniel Navarro,>University of Adelaide>University of Leuven>University of Adelaide>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0194/index.html
2017,Connecting stimulus-driven attention to the properties of infant-directed speech — Is exaggerated intonation also more surprising?,"The exaggerated intonation and special rhythmic properties of infant-directed speech (IDS) have been hypothesized to attract infant’s attention to the speech stream. However, studies investigating IDS in the context of models of attention are few. A number of such models suggest that surprising or novel perceptual inputs attract attention, where novelty can be operationalized as the statistical predictability of the stimulus in a context. Since prosodic patterns such as F0 contours are accessible to young infants who are also adept statistical learners, the present paper investigates a hypothesis that pitch contours in IDS are less predictable than those in adult-directed speech (ADS), thereby efficiently tapping into the basic attentional mechanisms of the listeners. Results from analyses with naturalistic IDS and ADS speech show that IDS has lower overall predictability of intonation across neighboring syllables even when the F0 contours in both speaking styles are normalized to the same frequency range.",>Okko Rasanen>Sofoklis Kakouros>Melanie Soderstrom,">Aalto University, Finland>Aalto University, Finland>University of Manitoba",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0195/index.html
2017,When does a 'visual proof by induction' serve a proof-like function in mathematics?,"A proof by mathematical induction demonstrates that a general theorem is necessarily true for all natural numbers. It has been suggested that some theorems may also be proven by a ‘visual proof by induction’ (Brown, 2010), despite the fact that the image only displays particular cases of the general theorem. In this study we examine the nature of the conclusions drawn from a visual proof by induction. We find that, while most university-educated viewers demonstrate a willingness to generalize the statement to nearby cases not depicted in the image, only viewers who have been trained in formal proof strategies show significantly higher resistance to the suggestion of large-magnitude counterexamples to the theorem. We conclude that for most university-educated adults without proof-training the image serves as the basis of a standard inductive generalization and does not provide the degree of certainty required for mathematical proof.",>Josephine Relaford-Doyle>Rafael Nunez,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0196/index.html
2017,Interpreting Asymmetric Perception in Speech Perception with Bayesian Inference,"We proposes a Bayesian account of asymmetries in speech perception: In many languages, listeners show greater sensitivity if a non-coronal sound (/b/, /p/, /g/, /k/) is changed to coronal sounds (/d/, /t/) than vice versa. These asymmetries is predominantly believed to reflect innate constraints from Universal Grammar. Alternatively, we propose that the asymmetries could arise from optimal inference given the statistical properties of different speech categories. In the framework of Bayesian inference, we examined two statistical parameters of coronal and non-coronal sounds: frequencies of occurrence and variance in articulation. In languages where the asymmetries are found, coronal are more frequent and/or more variable than non-coronals. Such differences makes an ideal observer more likely to perceive a non-coronal signal as a coronal segment than vice versa. Without assuming innateness and/or linguistics-specificity, we explain the perceptual asymmetries as a consequence of probabilistic inference similar to asymmetries observed in many other cognitive domains.",>Jie Ren>Joseph Austerweil,">Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, United States>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0197/index.html
2017,Quantitative Models of Human-Human Conversational Grounding Processes,"Natural language dialogue between multiple participants requires conversational grounding; however, the mechanisms involved are under dispute. Currently, two of the prominent grounding models are interactive alignment and interpersonal synergy. Using recurrence analysis, Fusaroli and Tylen (2016) simultaneously evaluated both models and showed that alignment is an insufficient explanation for grounding or for the teams’ task performance. However, their task and resulting dialogues lack the typical complexity of conversations or teamwork. Furthermore, the interpersonal synergy model was not clearly differentiated from other coordination-focused models of grounding with explicit foundations in strategy and intentionality (i.e., audience design, joint activity, perspective taking). Here we test recurrence-based models in a collaborative task that stressed the grounding process. Results support a coordination model of dialogue over the alignment model as a predictor of performance. Content-based mediation analyses showed that the coordination recurrence model includes critical aspects of strategic design and is not purely interpersonal synergy.",>Clayton D. Rothwell>Valerie L.

Upon perceiving a sentence, listeners decode the speaker's intended sentence from the prior probability that a speaker would say that sentence and the probability that it would be corrupted to the perceived sentence by noise. Here we examine the listener's noise model. Readers were asked to correct sentences if they thought they contained an error. We manipulated context such that participants corrected exposure sentences containing either deletion, insertion, swap, mixed, or no errors (e.g., swap: A bystander was rescued by the fireman in the time of nick.). Test sentences were syntactically licensed but implausible (e.g., The bat swung the player). On test sentences, participants' corrections differed by exposure condition. This suggests participants track the type of errors that have a higher likelihood and make inferences about the intentions of the speaker accordingly.",>Rachel Ryskin>Richard Futrell>Edward Gibson,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>MIT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0199/index.html

Inspired by this, we propose a framework which allows transforming Cascade-Correlation Neural Networks (CCNNs) into probabilistic generative models, thereby enabling CCNNs to generate samples from a category of interest. CCNNs are a well-known class of deterministic, discriminative NNs, which autonomously construct their topology, and have been successful in accounting for a variety of psychological phenomena. Our proposed framework is based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, called the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm, which capitalizes on the gradient information of the target distribution to direct its explorations towards regions of high probability, thereby achieving good mixing properties. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework.",>Ardavan Salehi Nobandegani>Thomas R.

However, there are few cognitive science approaches to this central phenomenon of norms. While there has been some progress in developing formal representations of norm systems (e.g., deontological approaches), we do not yet know basic properties of human norms: how they are represented, activated, and learned. Further, what computational models can capture these properties, and what algorithms could learn them? In this paper we describe initial experiments on human norm representations in which the context specificity of norms features prominently. We then provide a formal representation of norms using Dempster-Shafer Theory that allows a machine learning algorithm to learn norms under uncertainty from these human data, while preserving their context specificity.",>Vasanth Sarathy>Matthias Scheutz>Yoed Kenett>Mowafak Allaham>Joseph Austerweil>Bertram Malle,">Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA>Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155, USA>University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States>University of Illinois at Chicago>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA>Brown University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0202/index.html

These outcomes are well described by discounting functions. However, to fully understand the decision process one needs models describing how the process of decision-making unfolds dynamically over time. Here, we validate a recently published attractor model that extends discounting functions through a description of the dynamics leading to a final choice outcome within and across trials. We focus on the decision dynamics across trials. We derive qualitative predictions for the inter-trial dynamics of sequences of decisions that are unique to this type of model. We test these predictions in a delay discounting game where we sequentially manipulated subjective values of options across all attribute dimensions. Results confirm the model’s predictions. We discuss future challenges on integrating attractor models towards a general attractor model of delay discounting to enhance our understanding of the processes underlying delay discounting decisions.",>Martin Schoemann>Stefan Scherbaum,>Technische Universität Dresden>Technische Universität Dresden,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0203/index.html

An Analysis with a Computational Process Model,"To make inferences about the frequency of events, people often exploit observations of relevant instances sampled from their personal social network. We examined how this ability develops ontogenetically and conducted a study in which children and adults judged the relative frequencies of first names in Germany. Based on the recalled instances of the names in participants’ social networks, we modeled their frequency judgments and the underlying search process with a Bayesian hierarchical latent-mixture approach. We found that the judgments of most adults were best described by a noncompensatory strategy that assumes limited and sequentially ordered search, whereas the judgments of most children were best described by a compensatory strategy that assumes exhaustive search and information aggregation. These results highlight that already children use instance knowledge to infer event frequencies and suggest that the ability to conduct ordered and focused search is central to the development of noncompensatory instance-based inference.",>Christin Schulze>Thorsten Pachur>Ralph Hertwig,>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development>Max Planck Institute for Human Development,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0205/index.html
2017,Prior Expectations in Linguistic Learning: A Stochastic Model of Individual Differences,"When learners are exposed to inconsistent input, do they reproduce the probabilities in the input (probability matching), or produce some variants disproportionately often (regularization)? Laboratory results and computational models of artificial language learning both argue that the learning mechanism is basically probability matching, with regularization arising from additional factors. However, these models were fit to aggregated experimental data, which can exhibit probability matching even if all individuals regularize. To assess whether learning can be accurately characterized as basically probability matching or systematizing at the individual level, we ran a large-scale experiment. We found substantial individual variation. The structure of this variation is not predicted by recent beta-binomial models. We introduce a new model, the Double Scaling Sigmoid (DSS) model, fit its parameters on a by-participant basis, and show that it captures the patterns in the data.

Afterwards, the gender valence of the adjectives was measured. The results showed that participants generated more feminine adjectives for nouns with majority feminine translations compared to nouns with majority masculine translations.

Previous studies have often used object movements defined by experimenters. The present study used aerial videos recorded by drones in a real-life environment to generate decontextualized motion stimuli. Motion trajectories of displayed elements were the only visual input. We measured human judgments of interactiveness between two moving elements, and the dynamic change of such judgments over time. A hierarchical model was developed to account for human performance in this task, which represents interactivity using latent variables, and learns the distribution of critical movement features that signal potential interactivity. The model provides a good fit to human judgments and can also be generalized to the original Heider-Simmel animations (1944). The model can also synthesize decontextualized animations with controlled degree of interactiveness, providing a viable tool for studying animacy and social perception.",>Tianmin Shu>Yujia Peng>Lifeng Fan>Hongjing Lu>Song-Chun Zhu,">University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States>University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, The United State>University of California, Los Angeles>Psychology Department, UCLA>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0208/index.html

The evidence for this claim comes from laboratory studies. We describe spontaneous comparisons produced by 24 typically developing children from 26 to 58 months. Children tend to express similarity before expressing difference. They compare objects from the same category before objects from different categories, make global comparisons before specific comparisons, and specify perceptual features of similarity/difference before non-perceptual features. We then investigate how a theoretically interesting subset of children’s comparisons – those expressing a specific feature of similarity or difference – relates to analogical reasoning as measured by verbal and non-verbal tests in 6th grade. The number of specific comparisons children produce before 58 months predicts their scores on both tests, controlling for vocabulary at 54 months. The results provide naturalistic support for experimental findings on comparison development, and demonstrate a strong relationship between children’s early comparisons and their later analogical reasoning.",>Catriona Silvey>Dedre Gentner>Lindsey Richland>Susan Goldin-Meadow,>University of Chicago>Northwestern University>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0209/index.html

One such study found that children learned how to correctly activate machines, using either a block that was the same shape or color as the machine, when given five minutes to play with them. However, would children be able to learn a more complex causal rule through free play as well and would their performance be comparable to children who were didactically taught the same causal rule? In the current study, we show that children are able to learn more complex causal rules through free play. We also show that children perform significantly better when learning these rules through free play or by first engaging in free play and then observing, as opposed to solely through observation.",>Zi L.

We set out to test recent claims that content question words sound similar within languages as an adaptation to help listeners predict that a question is about to be asked. We test whether upcoming questions can be predicted based on the first phoneme of a turn and the prior context. We analyze the Switchboard corpus of English by means of a decision tree to test whether /w/ and /h/ are good statistical cues of upcoming questions. Based on the results, we perform a controlled experiment to test whether people really use these cues to recognize questions.

Bridging this gap, we develop a method to predict human impressions of faces in 40 subjective social dimensions, using deep representations from state-of-the-art neural networks. We find that model performance grows as the human consensus on a face trait increases, and that model predictions outperform human groups in correlation with human averages. This illustrates the learnability of subjective social perception of faces, especially when there is high human consensus. Our system can be used to decide which photographs from a personal collection will make the best impression.

In a comparison of three models each simulating existing descriptions of stereotype change, both empirical data and model fits suggest that stereotypes are updated using rational categorisation processes.

2017,"Population size, learning, and innovation determine linguistic complexity","There are a number of claims regarding why linguistic complexity varies, for example: i) different types of societal structure (e.g. Wray & Grace, 2007}, ii) population size (e.g. Lupyan & Dale, 2010), and iii) the proportion of child vs. adult learners (e.g. Trudgill, 2011). This simple model of interacting agents, capable of learning and innovation, partially supports all these accounts. However, several subtle points arise. Firstly, differences in the capacity or opportunity to learn determine how much complexity can remain stable. Secondly, small populations are susceptible to large amounts of drift and subsequent loss, unless innovation is frequent. Conversely, large populations remain resilient to change unless there is too much innovation, which leads to a collapse in complexity. Next, if learners are the main source of innovation, we can instead expect sustained complexity even in large populations of adult learners. Finally, creolisation does not imply simplification in smaller populations.",>Matthew Spike,">Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0215/index.html

The ability of this model to predict the effects of both familiar and novel marketing interventions suggests it as a plausible candidate theory of consumer marketing. Simultaneously, by clarifying the logic underneath the interplay between environmental exposure and preference distortions seen in economic decisions, this model rationalizes the seemingly irrational susceptibility of consumers to marketing.",>Nisheeth Srivastava>Ed Vul,>IIT Kanpur>UCSD Psychology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0216/index.html

How does experience with these metaphors shape the associations we make across domains? We tested English-speaking children and adults with a cross-domain matching task that assessed space-time and space-pitch mappings, using both spatial relations that are expressed in English-language metaphors and metaphors not employed in English. Participants performed a perceptual matching task that required matching pictures and sounds and a linguistic matching task that required matching pictures or sounds to labels. Adults readily matched across space-time and space-pitch pairings, using relations expressed both by familiar and unfamiliar metaphors. Children showed an advantage for linguistic compared to perceptual matching, but performance was similarly unaffected by metaphor familiarity. These results suggest that spatial language promotes the development of cross-domain associations, and that experience with particular metaphors is not required to produce this benefit.",>Ariel Starr>Mahesh Srinivasan,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0217/index.html

Relying on the causal power approach, Cheng and Novick (2005) proposed a model of causal attribution intended to help answering this question. We challenge this model, both conceptually and empirically. The central problem of this model is that it treats the presence of sufficient causes as necessarily causal in singular causation, and thus neglects that causes can be preempted in their efficacy. Also, the model neglects that reasoners incorporate uncertainty about the underlying causal structure and strengths of causes when making causal inferences. We propose a new measure of causal attribution and embed it into our structure induction model of singular causation (SISC).

2017,Marbles in Inaction: Counterfactual Simulation and Causation by Omission,"Consider the following causal explanation: The ball went through the goal because the defender didn’t block it. There are at least two problems with citing omissions as causal explanations. First, how do we choose the relevant candidate omission (e.g. why the defender and not the goalkeeper). Second, how do we determine what would have happened in the relevant counterfactual situation (i.e. maybe the shot would still have gone through the goal even if it had been blocked). In this paper, we extend the counterfactual simulation model (CSM) of causal judgment (Gerstenberg, Goodman, Lagnado, & Tenenbaum, 2014) to handle the second problem. In two experiments, we show how people’s causal model of the situation affects their causal judgments via influencing what counterfactuals they consider.

2017,A Two-Step Signal Detection Model of Belief Bias,"When asked to assess the deductive validity of an argument, people are influenced by their prior knowledge of the content. Recently, two competing explanations for this belief bias effect have been proposed, each based on signal detection theory. Under a response bias explanation, people set more lenient decision criteria for believable than for unbelievable arguments. Alternatively, believable and unbelievable arguments may differ in subjective argument strength for both valid and invalid items. Two experiments tested these accounts by asking participants to assess the validity of categorical syllogisms and rate their confidence.

2017,Rational use of prosody predicts projection in manner adverb utterances,"Speakers can be taken to be committed to utterance content even when that content is contributed in the scope of an entailment-canceling operator, like negation (e.g., Chierchia & McConnell-Ginet, 1990). We develop a probabilistic model of this phenomenon, called ‘projection’, that relies on the prosodic realization of utterances. We synthesize existing theoretical claims about prosody, information structure and projection into a model that assumes a rational speaker (Frank & Goodman, 2012) who produces utterances with prosodic melodies that can signal which utterance content she is committed to. Predictions of the probabilistic model are compared to the responses of an experiment designed to test the effect of prosody on projection in manner adverb utterances. Our findings lend support to analyses of projection that are sensitive to the information structure of utterances (e.g., Simons, Beaver, Roberts, & Tonhauser, 2017).",>Jon Stevens>Marie-Catherine de Marneffe>Shari Speer>Judith Tonhauser,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0221/index.html

We present a spiking neuron model of a common component that could be used in both tasks: an array of pointers. We show that if the model's single tuned parameter is set to match human accuracy performance in one task, then it also matches on the other task (with the exception of one data point). This provides a novel explanation of the relation, and proposes a common component that could be used across cognitive tasks.",>Terrence Stewart>Marcie Penner-Wilger>Rylan Waring>Michael Anderson,>University of Waterloo>King’s University College at Western University>University of Guelph>Franklin & Marshall College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0222/index.html
2017,"Flexible integration of a navigable, clustered environment","The representation of navigable space, consisting of multiple interconnected spaces, yet is not well understood. We examined different levels of integration within memory (local, regional, global). Participants learned two distinctive regions of a virtual environment that converged at a common transition-point. Subsequently, we tested their memory with a pointing task, varying body alignment during pointing, corridor distance to and regional belonging of the target. Pointing latency increased with increasing distance to the target and when pointing into the other region. Further, alignment with local, regional and global reference frames were found to facilitate pointing latency. These findings suggest that participants memorized local corridors, clustered corridors into regions, and also formed global reference frames, thus, represented the environment on multiple levels of integration. They are inconsistent with conceptions of spatial memory for navigable environments based either on exclusive representation within a single reference frame or exclusive reliance on local reference frames.",>Marianne Strickrodt>Heinrich H.

We consider the role of distributional semantic features of CDS in language acquisition. We view semantic structure as a manifold on which words lie. We compare the semantic structure of verbs in CDS to the semantic structure of child speech (CS) and adult-directed speech (ADS) by measuring how easy it is to align the manifolds. We find that it is easier to align verbs in CS to CDS than to align CS to ADS, suggesting that the semantic structure of CDS is reflected in child productions. We also find, by measuring verbs vertex degrees in a semantic graph, that a mixed initialized set of verbs with high degrees and medium degrees has the best performance among all alignments, suggesting that both semantic generality and diversity may be important for developing semantic representations.",>Hao Sun>John Pate,">University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, United States>The University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0224/index.html
2017,¿From Abstract to Concrete? Evidence for designing learning platforms that adapt to user's proficiencies.,"Digital-tablets distribute cognition through visual, auditory and haptic interactivity. We designed a tutor-game that explored how narratives ((S)trong/(W)eak) and gestures ((I)conic/(D)eictic) combine to situate embodied learning. Students played seven levels of a fractions game designed to teach them how to create and compare fractions. One hundred thirty-one students (age x̄=8.78 yrs, 52.6% Female) were randomly assigned to one of four groups (SI, SD, WI, WD) in a 2x2 factorial experiment. Students completed pre/post direct and transfer assessments and tutor-game log data was mined to explore students' learning. Results revealed a significant interaction between narrative and gesture moderated by student proficiency. In effect, students new to fractions performed better in an abstracted environment using deictic (pointing) gestures. However, as students' proficiencies improved, they learned better using iconically enactive gestures in strong narrative (with setting, characters and plot). This has important implications for designing adaptive learning platforms and curricula for teaching fractions.",>Michael I. Swart>Sorachai Kornkasem>Nirmaliz Colon-Acosta>Amy Hachigian>Jonathan M.

2017,Supporting Low-Performing Students by Manipulating Self-efficacy in Digital Tutees,"Abstract Educational software based on teachable agents has repeatedly proven to have positive effects on students’ learning outcomes. The strongest effects have been shown for low-performers. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explore this outcome, in particular mechanisms that involve attributions of social agency to teachable agents. Our study examined whether an expression of high versus low self-efficacy in a teachable agent would affect low-performing students with respect to their learning outcomes and with respect to a potential change in their own self-efficacy. The learning domain was mathematics, specifically the base-ten system. Results were that the learning outcomes of low-performers who taught a low self-efficacy agent were significantly better than the learning outcomes of low-performers who taught a high self-efficacy agent. There were no effects from the manipulation of self-efficacy expressed by the teachable agent on changes of the low-performing students’ own self-efficacy.",>Betty Tärning>Magnus Haake>Agneta Gulz,">Department of philosophy and cognitive science, Lund, Sweden>Department of philosophy and cognitive science, Lund, Sweden>Department of philosophy and cognitive science, Lund, Sweden",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0226/index.html
2017,The impact of practice frequency on learning and retention,"The current study manipulated how frequently different problems were practiced during a first day of practice, with the more frequent items being more closely spaced. Fitting the data to a skill acquisition model, we find that greater spacing between items is associated with an increased probability of transitioning to more efficient phases of performance, but with a shallower speedup within each phase. Three days after training, we find that performance is predicted not by the practice frequency during training, but rather by the phase of skill acquisition attained during training. Thus, it is type of processing achieved not the amount and spacing of practice, that determines retention. Spacing, however, promotes learning by driving changes in cognitive processing.",>Caitlin Tenison>John Anderson,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0227/index.html
2017,Warm (for winter): Comparison class understanding in vague language,"Speakers often refer to context only implicitly when using language. ""It's warm outside"" could signal warm relative to other days of the year or just the current season (e.g., warm for winter). ""Warm"" conveys the temperature is high relative to some comparison class, but little is known about how a listener decides upon such a standard of comparison. We formalize how world knowledge and listeners' internal models of speech production can drive the resolution of a comparison class in context. We introduce a Rational Speech Act model and derive two novel predictions from it, which we validate in an experiment that measures listeners' beliefs about the likely comparison class used by a speaker. Our model makes quantitative predictions given prior knowledge for the domains in question. We triangulate this knowledge with a follow-up language task in the same domains, using Bayesian data analysis to infer priors from both data sets.",>Michael Henry Tessler>Michael Lopez-Brau>Noah Goodman,>Stanford University>University of Central Florida>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0228/index.html
2017,Neural and computational arguments for memory as a compressed supported timeline,"It is well known that, all things being equal, the accuracy of mammalian timing and memory decays gradually with the passage of time. The gradual decay of temporal accuracy is also observed in single-unit neural recordings. Here we review recent modeling work describing a specific mechanism for timing and memory and relevant neural data. The model describes a neural mechanism that can give rise to a logarithmically compressed representation of the recent past. We examine the specific predictions of the model, in particular that the elapse of time is represented by sequentially activated cells which fire for a circumscribed period of time. Such cells, called time cells, have been observed in neural recordings from several brain regions in multiple species. As predicted by the model, the cells show accuracy that decreases with time.",>Zoran Tiganj>Karthik Shankar>Marc Howard,">Center for Memory and Brain, Boston University>Center for Memory and Brain, Boston University>Center for Memory and Brain, Boston University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0229/index.html
2017,Picturing time: Children’s preferences for visual representations of events,"English-speaking adults recruit a left-to-right “mental timeline” (MTL) when thinking about time. The origins of the MTL are debated, with some arguing that it is a cultural construct and others arguing it may be innate. Here we ask whether preschoolers, with limited experience with cultural practices thought to shape the MTL, prefer conventional linear representations of events. English-speaking preschoolers and adults were told stories and asked to choose which of two visual representations best illustrated the story. As expected, adults overwhelmingly preferred images that were linearly ordered from left-to-right. Five-year-olds also preferred left-to-right to right-to-left series, but were equally likely choose left-to-right and top-to-bottom. By contrast, 3-year-olds chose at random, apparently insensitive to the spatial ordering of event-denoting images. These results suggest that attention to the ordinal structure of visual representations of time increases across early childhood, and that adults’ preference for horizontal space-time mappings results from increased cultural conditioning.",>Katharine Tillman>Eren Fukuda>David Barner,">University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0230/index.html

Current theories stress the role of associative learning on lexical development. However, there have been no attempts to explain the atypical lexical development in DS based on atypical associative learning. The long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synapses, underlying associative learning, are altered in DS. Here we present a neural network model that instantiates notions from neurophysiological studies to account for the disparities between lexical comprehension and production in DS. Our simulations show that an atypical LTP/LTD balance affects comprehension and production differently in an associative model of lexical development.",>Angel Tovar>Gert Westermann,">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, CIudad de México, México>Lancaster University, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0231/index.html
2017,The temporal dynamics of base rate neglect: People may not be intuitive statisticians after all,"According to a classic view of reasoning, intuition is fast but fallible, while reflection is slow but reliable. Biases, therefore, emerge when a reasoner’s intuitions are wrong and they fail to notice. Recent evidence, however, suggests that people may be aware when their intuitions are incorrect. A possible explanation reason for this is that both correct and incorrect responses are cued in parallel, but the strongly-cued incorrect response is given unless people can inhibit it. We tested this explanation using base rate neglect problems, and recorded participants’ mouse cursor movements as they chose between possible answers under time pressure. Descriptions affected both participants’ early movements and ultimate responses, and interfered with their use of the base rates, while base rates rarely interfered with participants’ use of descriptions, and then only at a later point in time. Thus, despite suggestive findings elsewhere, our results support the classic of view reasoning.",>Eoin Travers>Jonathan J.

2017,Promoting Spontaneous Analogical Transfer by Idealizing Target Representations,"Recent results demonstrate that inducing an abstract representation of target analogs at retrieval time aids access to analogous situations with mismatching surface features (i.e., the late abstraction principle). A limitation of current implementations of this principle is that they either require the external provision of target-specific information or demand very high intellectual engagement. Experiment 1 demonstrated that constructing an idealized situation model of a target problem increases the rate of correct solutions compared to constructing either concrete simulations or no simulations. Experiment 2 confirmed that these results were based on an advantage for accessing the base analog, and not merely on an advantage of idealized simulations for understanding the target problem in its own terms. This target idealization strategy has broader applicability than prior interventions based on the late abstraction principle, because it can be achieved by a greater proportion of participants and without the need to receive target-specific information.",>Máximo Trench>Lucía Micaela Tavernini>Robert L.

2017,It’s all in your head: Effects of expertise on real-time access to knowledge during written sentence processing,"Real-time sentence processing involves connecting linguistic input with knowledge. Here, we ask how variability in semantic memory (specific domain knowledge) may influence semantic access in real-time sentence processing. We recorded EEG while participants more/less knowledgeable about the narrative world of Harry Potter (HP) read sentences. In Experiment 1, all participants showed N400 predictability effects for general-knowledge sentences, but only those with high HP knowledge showed predictability effects for sentences about Harry Potter. This effect was driven by graded brain responses to predictable endings as a function of knowledge. Experiment 2 revealed greater semantic activation (inferred from N400 effects) for HP items participants reported knowing. High-knowledge participants also showed greater semantic activation for items they reported not knowing/remembering. These findings suggest that amount and/or functional organization of knowledge has real-time consequences on written sentence processing and implicate implicit/partial access to domain knowledge for experts when information is not explicitly recalled.",>Melissa Troyer>Marta Kutas,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0234/index.html

But it is still unclear which general cognitive processes support the use of context in conversation. Research on pragmatic use in language implicates working memory and inhibitory control; however, no studies have shown evidence of a shared cognitive mechanism in both production and comprehension within an individual. The current study asked a) whether referential context use is supported by the same cognitive mechanisms in production and comprehension, b) which processes are implicated, and c) whether the nature of the context itself affects processing. Participants completed a referential communication eye-tracking task in which a disambiguating adjective was either necessary or over-informative, as well as a cognitive test battery.

Afterwards, we used the MATLAB system identification toolbox to identify the transfer function between input and output. The identified model is validated with a validation data set that has been excluded from the identification process.

2017,The Dynamics of Selective Integration during Rapid Experiential Decisions,"When making decisions humans often violate the principles of rational choice theory. Recent experiments, involving rapid experiential decisions, uncovered a mechanism that is responsible for various rationality violations. According to this selective gating mechanism, incoming value samples are accumulated across time, but prior to their accumulation they are weighted in proportion to their momentary rank-order. Here, using a data-driven approach, I present a dynamic extension of this mechanism, which involves potentially asymmetric inhibition between the inputs. As a result, and contrary to the previous selective gating implementation, the vigour of gating is modulated by the difference between two value samples (a distance effect) as well as by the absolute magnitude of the samples (a magnitude effect). This extension offers a superior explanation to existing and new data; and links high-level decision phenomena with computational principles previously described in theories of selective attention and visual search.",>Konstantinos Tsetsos,">Department of Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology, University Medical Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0237/index.html

The task ecology can be designed such that participants can work on it in a low interactivity environment, maintaining a mental representation of simulated moves, or in a high interactivity environment, thinking with and through a physical model of the problem. These task ecologies involve working memory to a different degree: Problem solving draws more on working memory the lower the degree of physical interaction. Participants first engaged in a writing task that required vigilance to inhibit common word choices, a degree of self regulation designed to induce a so-called ego depletion; participants then worked on the ToC problem in either a low or high interactivity environment.

2017,Approximations of Predictive Entropy Correlate with Reading Times,"The lexical frequency of an upcoming word affects reading times even when the upcoming word is masked from readers (Angele et al., 2015). One explanation for this observation is that readers may slow down if there is high uncertainty about upcoming material. In line with this hypothesis, this study finds a positive correlation between predictive entropy and self-paced reading times. This study also demonstrates that such predictive entropy can be effectively approximated by the surprisal of upcoming observations and that this future surprisal estimate is more predictive of reading times when the grammar is more granular, which would be prohibitively expensive for predictive entropy. These results suggest readers engage in fine-grained predictive estimations of certainty about upcoming lexical and syntactic material, that such predictions influence reading times, and that estimating that uncertainty can be done less expensively and more robustly with information-theoretic surprisal.",>Marten van Schijndel>William Schuler,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0242/index.html

First, we show analytically that when true statistical power is relatively low, computing power based on statistically significant results will lead to overestimates of power. Then, we present a case study using 10 experimental comparisons drawn from a recently published meta-analysis in psycholinguistics (Jäger et al., 2017).

In sentence comprehension, it is widely assumed that the distance between linguistic co-dependents affects the latency of dependency resolution: the longer the distance, the longer the retrieval time (the distance-based account). An alternative theory, direct-access, assumes that retrieval times are a mixture of two distributions: one distribution represents successful retrievals (these are independent of dependency distance) and the other represents an initial failure to retrieve the correct dependent, followed by a reanalysis that leads to successful retrieval.

Bayesian inference in a model of rational action – called inverse planning – captures how humans infer desires from observable actions. These models represent desires as simple associations between agents and world states. In this paper we show that by representing desires as probabilistic programs, an inverse planning model can infer complex desires underlying complex behaviors—desires with temporal and logical structure, which can be fulfilled in different ways. Our model, which combines basic desires via logical primitives, is inspired by recent probabilistic grammar-based models of concept learning. Through an experiment where we vary behaviors parametrically, we show that our model predicts with high accuracy how people infer complex desires.

Western Aphasia Battery-Revised subtest scores correlated with task performance, suggesting diverse forms of language impairment may contribute to errors.

Via the process of multisensory integration, this input is often integrated into a unitary percept. Researchers have investigated several factors that could affect the process of multisensory integration. However, in this field of research, social factors (i.e., whether a task is performed alone or jointly) have been widely neglected. Using an audiovisual crossmodal congruency task we investigated whether social factors affect audiovisual integration. Pairs of participants received congruent or incongruent audiovisual stimuli and were required to indicate the elevation of these stimuli. We found that the reaction time cost of responding to incongruent stimuli (relative to congruent stimuli) was reduced significantly when participants performed the task jointly compared to when they performed the task alone.

However, there is mixed evidence for when this ability develops, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically. Apparent success in relational reasoning may be evidence for conceptual understanding or may be due to low-level, perceptual strategies. We introduce a method to discriminate these possibilities by pitting two conditions that are perceptually matched but conceptually different: in a “fused” condition, same and different objects are joined, creating single objects that have the same perceptual features as the pairs in the “relational” condition. However, the “fused” objects do not provide evidence for the relation. Using this method in a causal task provides evidence for genuine conceptual understanding. This novel technique offers a simple manipulation that may be applied to a variety of existing match-to-sample procedures used to assess same-different reasoning to include in future research with non-human animals, as well as human infants.",>Caren Walker>Alison Gopnik,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0249/index.html

Results also showed verbs and word order were the first to be acquired, followed by nouns, adjectives and finally case markers.

The first I call the dynamical explanation and the second I call the historical explanation. The mechanists have given us reasons for doubting that the first alternative makes for a good explanation. The historical explanation does not hit the right explanatory target without the introduction of a proximate mechanism, but the proximate mechanisms suggested by radical enactivism are associationist mechanisms, the limitations of which led to the initial widespread endorsement of representationalism.

2017,Learning to reinforcement learn,"In recent years deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have attained superhuman performance in a number of challenging task domains, but are constrained by a demand for large training sets. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways and exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in five proof-of-concept experiments to examine key aspects of deep meta-RL.",>Jane Wang>Zeb Kurth-Nelson>Hubert Soyer>Joel Leibo>Dhruva Tirumala>Remi Munos>Charles Blundell>Dharshan Kumaran>Matt Botvinick,">DeepMind>DeepMind, Max Planck-UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry>DeepMind>DeepMind>DeepMind>DeepMind>DeepMind>DeepMind, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL>DeepMind, Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0252/index.html
2017,The Learning of Subordinate Word Meanings,"In three experiments, adults attempted to learn words with subordinate-level meanings (dalmatian) by sampling the referent world cross-situationally. Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007 predicted that encountering three uses of a word, each referring to a dalmatian would evoke “suspicious coincidence” inferencing, leading to the subordinate meaning (dalmatian). Exp. 1 found little evidence for this; cross-situational exposure led to a basic-level bias. This bias was unchanged even when the sample was increased to five subordinate exemplars (Exp. 2). Exp. 3 encouraged semantic contrast by simultaneously teaching each subject a word for the subordinate-level and the basic-level category within the same semantic domain (dap=dalmatian; blit=dog). Participants now showed non-basic level learning, but more in line with mutual exclusivity: they may think “dap” means dalmatian but “blit” means all-dogs-except-dalmatians. We conclude that the basic-level interpretation is powerful and cannot be removed by the mere observation of exemplar items over multiple word instances.",>Hao Wang>Lila Gleitman>John Trueswell,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0253/index.html
2017,Anticipatory Synchronization in Artificial Agents,"By integrating theories and methodologies from a diverse range of scientific disciplines (e.g., physics, neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology and robotics engineering) the present work is aimed at harnessing self-organized anticipatory synchronization in order to advance human-robotic interaction (HRI). This phenomenon is characterized by the emergence of anticipatory behavior by one system coupled to the chaotic behavior of another, following the introduction of short self-referential delays in the coordinating system. The current set of studies involved the creation of an artificial agent based on a time-delayed, low-dimensional dynamical model capable of behaving prospectively during an interaction with a human actor performing complex, unpredictable behaviors. By achieving characteristics similar to those observed during natural human interaction and coordination, the time-delayed modeling approached advocated here provides the potential for considerable future advancements in HRI.",>Auriel Washburn>Rachel Kallen>Maurice Lamb>Nigel Stepp>Kevin Shockley>Michael Richardson,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>HRL Laboratories, Malibu, CA, USA>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0254/index.html
2017,Structure Learning in Motor Control: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Model,"Motor adaptation displays a structure-learning effect: adaptation to a new perturbation occurs more quickly when the subject has prior exposure to perturbations with related structure. Although this `learning-to-learn' effect is well documented, its underlying computational mechanisms are poorly understood. We present a new model of motor structure learning, approaching it from the point of view of deep reinforcement learning. Previous work outside of motor control has shown how recurrent neural networks can account for learning-to-learn effects. We leverage this insight to address motor learning, by importing it into the setting of model-based reinforcement learning. We apply the resulting processing architecture to empirical findings from a landmark study of structure learning in target-directed reaching (Braun et al., 2009), and discuss its implications for a wider range of learning-to-learn phenomena.",>Ari Weinstein>Matthew Botvinick,">Deepmind, London, United Kingdom>DeepMind, London, United Kingdom

2017,Children’s intuitions about the structure of mental life,"We investigated children’s understanding of mental life by analyzing attributions of perceptual, cognitive, affective, and other capacities. 200 children (7-9y) and 200 adults evaluated the mental capacities of beetles or robots. By assessing which capacities traveled together when participants disagreed about these controversial “edge cases,” we reconstructed the latent structure underlying mental capacity judgments from the bottom up—a novel approach to elucidating conceptual structure among children. For both children and adults, factor analyses revealed a distinction between social-emotional, physiological, and perceptual-cognitive capacities, hinting at three fundamental ways of explaining and predicting others’ actions: as social partners, biological creatures, and goal-directed agents (each involving related forms of both “experience” and “agency”; Gray et al., 2007). Relative to adults, children attributed greater social-emotional capacities to beetles and robots, suggesting that intuitive ontologies of mental life could be critical for making sense of children’s developing understanding of the social world.",>Kara Weisman>Carol Dweck>Ellen Markman,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0256/index.html
2017,The Effect of expertise and biscriptalism on letter perception: The complexity benefit,"Previous work has demonstrated that the visual complexity of letter-shapes is processed differently by naïve and expert observers. Specifically, fluent readers of the Arabic alphabet were found to discriminate complex letters more readily than less complex letters, whereas naïve observers exhibited the opposite effect. This “complexity benefit”, wherein complex letters confer a processing advantage to expert observers, is not yet well understood. In a new study, we investigate whether this effect generalizes across scripts, and whether it is unique to individuals with biscriptal experience (knowledge of reading two different scripts). The results of the three experiments confirm that the complexity benefit is characteristic of expert monoscriptal and biscriptal readers, and that, furthermore, there may be a biscriptal advantage in processing visual complexity.",>Robert Wiley>Brenda Rapp,">Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States>Johns Hopkins University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0257/index.html
2017,Examining Multiscale Movement Coordination in Collaborative Problem Solving,"During collaborative problem solving (CPS), coordination occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. This multiscale coordination should play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyads. We used cross-wavelet coherence to examine movement coordination, extracted from video, at several scales and tested whether the observed coordination was greater expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m) was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we observed that coherence at 25s and 1s scales was predictive of performance. However, when including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance. We discuss these findings and their relevance to understanding how coordination facilitates CPS.",>Travis J.

2017,A Computational Model for Constructing Preferences for Multiple Choice Options,"When choosing between multiple alternatives, people usually do not have ready-made preferences in their mind but rather construct them on the go. The 2N-ary Choice Tree Model (Wollschlaeger & Diederich, 2012) proposes a preference construction process for N choice options from description, which is based on attribute weights, differences between attribute values, and noise. It is able to produce similarity, attraction, and compromise effects, which have become a benchmark for multi-alternative choice models, but also several other context and reference point effects. Here, we present a new and mathematically tractable version of the model – the Simple Choice Tree Model – which also explains the above mentioned effects and additionally accounts for the positive correlation between the attraction and compromise effect, and the negative correlation between these two and the similarity effect as observed by Berkowitsch, Scheibehenne, and Rieskamp (2014).",>Lena M.

2017,Mapping the unknown: The spatially correlated multi-armed bandit,"We introduce the spatially correlated multi-armed bandit as a task coupling function learning with the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Participants interacted with bi-variate reward functions on a two-dimensional grid, with the goal of either gaining the largest average score or finding the largest payoff. By providing an opportunity to learn the underlying reward function through spatial correlations, we model to what extent people form beliefs about unexplored payoffs and how that guides search behavior. Participants adapted to assigned payoff conditions, performed better in smooth than in rough environments, and---surprisingly---sometimes performed equally well in short as in long search horizons. Our modeling results indicate a preference for local search options, which when accounted for, still suggests participants were best-described as forming local inferences about unexplored regions, combined with a search strategy that directly traded off between exploiting high expected rewards and exploring to reduce uncertainty about the spatial structure of rewards.",>Charley M.

2017,What do you really think? Children’s ability to infer others’ desires when emotional expressions change between social and nonsocial contexts,"We investigate children’s ability to use social display rules to infer agents’ otherwise under-determined desires. In Experiment 1, seven-to-ten-year-olds saw a protagonist express one emotional reaction to an event in front of her social partner (the Social Context), and a different expression behind her social partner’s back (the Nonsocial Context). Children were able to use the expression in the Social Context to infer the social partner’s desire and the expression in the Nonsocial Context to infer the protagonist’s desire. This ability increased between ages seven and ten (Experiment 1). When task demands were reduced (Experiment 2), seven-to-eight-year-olds, but not five-to-six-year-olds, succeeded. These results suggest that although it is not easy for observers to infer emotions masked by social display rules, changing emotional expressions between social and non-social contexts allow even children to recover not only the desire of the person displaying the emotions, but also that of the audience.",>Yang Wu>Laura Schulz,>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0261/index.html
2017,Discovering Multicausality in the Development of Coordinated Behavior,"Human interaction involves the organization of a collection of sensorimotor systems across space and time. The study of how coordination develops in child-parent interaction has primarily focused on understanding the development of specific coordination patterns from individual modalities. However, less work has taken a systems view and investigated the development of coordination among multiple interdependent behaviors. In the present work, we used Granger causality as a mathematical model to construct dyadic causal networks of multimodal data collected from a longitudinal study of child-parent interaction. At a group-level, we observed increases in the number of causal links and in the strength of such links in dyadic interaction from 9-months to 12-months. At an individual-level, we observed high variability in the types of causal links that emerged across developmental ages. We discuss these results in terms of a multicausality hypothesis for the development of human coordination.",>Tian Linger Xu>Drew H.

These algorithms do not select information at random, but attempt to provide the user with relevant information. In doing so, the algorithms may incur potential negative consequences related to, for example, ""filter bubbles."" Building from existing algorithms, we introduce a parametrized model that unifies and interpolates between recommending relevant information and active learning. In a concept learning paradigm, we illustrate the trade-offs of optimizing prediction and recommendation, show that there is a broad parameter region of stable performance that optimizes for both, identify a specific regime that is most robust to human variability, and identify the cause of this optimized performance. We conclude by discussing implications for the cognitive science of concept learning and the practice of machine learning in the real world.",>Scott Cheng-Hsin Yang>Jake Alden Whritner>Olfa Nasraoui>Patrick Shafto,>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>University of Louisville>Rutgers University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0263/index.html
2017,A non-parametric Bayesian prior for causal inference of auditory streaming,"Human perceptual grouping of sequential auditory cues has traditionally been modeled using a mechanistic approach. The problem however is essentially one of source inference – a problem that has recently been tackled using statistical Bayesian models in visual and auditory-visual modalities. Usually the models are restricted to performing inference over just one or two possible sources, but human perceptual systems have to deal with much more complex scenarios. To characterize human perception we have developed a Bayesian inference model that allows an unlimited number of signal sources to be considered: it is general enough to allow any discrete sequential cues, from any modality. The model uses a non-parametric prior, hence increased complexity of the signal does not necessitate more parameters. The model gives an excellent fit to data from an auditory stream segregation experiment in which the pitch and presentation rate of pure tones determined the perceived number of sources",>Tim Yates>Nathanael Larigaldie>Ulrik Beierholm,>University of Birmingham>Durham University>Durham University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0264/index.html

This representation allows us to view certain types of non-normative judgments, such as conjunction fallacies, as arising from a misestimation of the correlation between events, that might arise when decision-makers have no prior information about the frequency of co-occurrence. We suggest that decision-makers use the perceived similarity between events to make inferences about correlation, and we describe the results of an experiment showing that judged correlation and violations of independence in probabilistic judgments are strongly influenced by the perceived similarity between events.",>James Yearsley>Daier Yuan>Jennifer Trueblood,">Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0265/index.html
2017,Causal and compositional generative models in online perception,"From a quick glance or the touch of an object, our brains map sensory signals to scenes composed of rich and detailed shapes and surfaces. Unlike the standard approaches to perception, we argue that this mapping draws on internal causal and compositional models of the physical world and these internal models underlie the generalization capacity of human perception. Here, we present a generative model of visual and multisensory perception in which the latent variables encode intrinsic (e.g., shape) and extrinsic (e.g., occlusion) object properties. Latent variables are inputs to causal models that output sense-specific signals. We present a recognition network that performs efficient inference in the generative model, computing at a speed similar to online perception. We show that our model, but not alternatives, can account for human performance in an occluded face matching task and in a visual-to-haptic face matching task.",>Ilker Yildirim>Michael Janner>Mario Belledonne>Christian Wallraven>Winrich Freiwald>Josh Tenenbaum,>MIT>MIT>MIT>Korea University>Rockefeller University>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0266/index.html

However, it is unknown how risk attitude relates to attention and information search. In this paper, we explore the relationship between risk attitude (as measured by a variant of EU) and eye movement patterns (which serve as a proxy for attention and information search). Participants made choices between gambles presented perceptually as flickering grids in which monetary values were indicated by colors and probabilities by color proportions. To explore attention and information search patterns, we investigated eye movement patterns when faced with different gambles and correlated these patterns with the parameters of EU. We observed that people who are more risk-seeking (as determined by modeling) tend to look at risky options more often. These results bridge choice behaviors conceptualized by EU and information search strategies under risky decision-making revealed by eye movements.",>Siyuan Yin>Jennifer Trueblood,">Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0267/index.html
2017,Novel Evidence for the Bilingual Advantage: Effects of Language Control on Executive Function in Balanced and Unbalanced Dual-Language Users,"Bilinguals’ need to monitor and inhibit non-relevant languages over a relevant one confers advantage in cognitive control. No studies have demonstrated that the dual-language control process directly contributes to the bilingual cognitive advantage. We utilized a novel language control manipulation paradigm where 83 English-Chinese bilingual adults completed a reading and comprehension task in either single-language (low-language-control) or dual-language (high-language-control) prior to performing nonverbal executive control tasks (Stroop, task-switching, and n-back). Results showed that language control had significant effects on subsequent cognitive performance, depending on whether the participants were regular dual language users or not. In the dual-language condition, but not the single-language condition, participants who used both languages regularly demonstrated a smaller mixing cost in task-switching and a greater sensitivity in n-back detection compared to participants who did not. This suggests that dual language control utilizes similar resources as executive function and frequent dual language use enhances this resource.",>W. Quin Yow>Adam C.

2017,Inconvenient samples: Modeling the effects of non-consent by coupling observational and experimental results,"Biased sampling of participants presents a major limiting factor for the generalizability of findings from behavioral studies. This effect may be especially pronounced in developmental studies, where parents serve as both the primary environmental input and decide whether their child participates in a study. To estimate the effects of parental non-consent, we coupled naturalistic observations of parent-child interactions with a behavioral test. Results showed that one particular parenting practice, the tendency to use questions to teach, associated with both children’s behavior in the test and parents’ tendencies to participate. Exploiting these associations with a model-based multiple imputation, we estimated that the means of the consented and not-consented groups could differ as much as 0.2 standard deviations for five of the seven test measurements we used, and standard deviations are likely underestimated. These results suggest that ignoring the role of consent may lead to systematic biases when generalizing beyond lab samples.",>Yue Yu>Elizabeth Bonawitz>Patrick Shafto,>Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark>Rutgers University - Newark,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0269/index.html

We demonstrate that, consistent with the developmental systems view, sustained visual attention emerges from and is tightly tied to sensory motor coordination. We examined whether changes in manual behavior alter toddlers’ eye gaze by giving one group of children heavy toys that were hard to pick up, while giving another group of children perceptually identical toys that were lighter, easy to pick up and hold. We found a tight temporal coupling between the dynamics of visual attention and the dynamics of manual activities, a relation that cannot be explained by interest. In the Heavy condition, toddlers looked at objects just as much as did toddlers in the Light condition but did so through many brief glances, whereas in Light condition looks to the objects were longer and sustained. We discuss the implication of hand-eye coordination in the development of visual attention.",>Lei Yuan>Tian Linger Xu>Chen Yu>Linda Smith,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0270/index.html
2017,Mindshaping the world can make mindreading tractable: Bridging the gap between philosophy and computational complexity analysis,"It is often assumed that the socio-cultural context positively influences mindreading performances. Among the available theories, mindshaping is proposed to consist of cultural mechanisms that make the social domain homogeneous and, hence, easier to interpret. Proponents of the mindshaping hypothesis claim that homogeneity is responsible for the computational tractability of mindreading, which is otherwise intractable. In this paper, we examine this core claim of mindshaping and investigate how homogeneity influences mindreading tractability. By taking action understanding as a case-study for mindreading, we formally operationalize mindshaping homogeneity in different ways with the goal of bridging the gap between informal claims and formal (in)tractability results. The analysis shows that only specific combinations of homogeneity may lead to tractable mindreading, whilst others do not. Additionally, the analysis reveals the possibility of a yet undiscovered mindshaping mechanism.",>Andrea Zeppi>Mark Blokpoel,">Department of Cognitive Science, University of Messina>Department of Artificial Intelligence, Radboud University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0271/index.html

As the number and complexity of mouse-tracking studies rapidly increase, more sophisticated methodology is needed to analyse the decision trajectories. Here we present a new computational approach to generating decision landscape visualisations based on mouse-tracking data. Decision landscape is an analogue of energy potential field mathematically derived from velocity of mouse movement during a decision. Visualised as a 3D surface, it provides a comprehensive overview of motor evolution of decisions. Employing the dynamical systems theory framework, we develop a new method for generating decision landscapes based on arbitrary number of trajectories. The decision landscape visualisation have potential to become a novel tool for analysing mouse trajectories during decision execution, which can provide new insights into the dynamics of decision making.",>Arkady Zgonnikov>Andrea Aleni>Petri Piiroinen>Denis O'Hora,">School of Psychology, National University of Ireland, Galway>Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology University of Naples Federico II, Italy>School of Mathematics, Statistics & Applied Mathematics, National University of Ireland, Galway>School of Psychology, National University of Ireland, Galway",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0272/index.html

Through eye movement examinations, here we test the hypothesis that this effect is due to impaired visual attention functions for retrieving diagnostic features in facial expression judgments. 23 individuals with insomnia symptoms and 23 non-insomniac controls completed a task to categorize happy, sad, fearful, and angry faces. The insomniacs were less accurate to recognize angry faces and made more “fearful” mistakes than controls. A hidden Markov modeling approach for eye movement data analysis revealed that when recognizing angry faces, more insomniacs adopted an eye movement pattern focusing on the mouth while more controls adopted a pattern attending to both the eyes and the mouth. It is consistent with previous findings that the primary diagnostic feature for recognizing angry faces is the eyes suggesting that impaired information selection through visual attention control may account for the compromised emotion perception in insomnia.",>Jinxiao Zhang>Antoni B.

In this setting, a naive judgment strategy prescribes an equal weight for each cue. However, we find that many participants appear to use a weighting scheme based on a low-dimensional representation of the cue space. The use of such a representation is consistent with core insights in semantic memory research and has important optimality properties concerning judgment accuracy.",>Joyce Wenjia Zhao>Sudeep Bhatia>Clintin Davis-Stober,">Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania>Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania>Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0274/index.html

To date, such research has typically restricted consideration to the perceptual modalities of vision, touch, sound, taste, and smell.

First, it is difficult to come up with a fixed content that seems to apply across all uses of a single word (Wittgensten, 1953). Second, the meaning of a word is subject to wider contextual constraints beyond the company it keeps with other words within a sentence. Third, the assumption that a word means a fixed thing is at odds with the fact that word meaning shifts over time, as do the objects a word refers to.

As further actions are taken, the accuracy of such models can be monitored, to detect surprises and to help identify and prioritize learning goals.

Ding, Melloni, Zhang, Tian, and Poeppel (2016) recently presented evidence that cortical entrainment during speech perception reflects the neural tracking of hierarchical syntactic structure of simple sentences, which would support the view that hierarchical processing is unavoidable. However, we show that the same entrainment effects appear in a computational model that does not incorporate syntax or any other linguistic knowledge or process beyond the word level. Hence, the cortical entrainment results do not need to be indicative of syntactic processing.",>Stefan Frank>Jin-Biao Yang,">Radboud University, Nijmegen>NYU Shanghai",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0280/index.html

The ‘social glue’ hypothesis of mimicry claims that mimicry behavior has a key causal role in social affiliation (Lakin, Jefferis, Cheng, & Chartrand, 2003; van Baaren, Janssen, Chartrand, & Dijksterhuis, 2009).

2017,Deep Networks as Models of Human and Animal Categorization,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained as classifiers learn by associating visual inputs (e.g., photographs of ob- jects) with appropriate output labels (e.g., “crow”, “dog”, “car”). These complex models, which contain millions of weights, are the state-of-the art in machine vision, rivaling humans in object recognition tasks (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015; Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012). What these networks learn displays some commonalities with hu- man learning (Kubilius, Bracci, & de Beeck, 2016; Lake, Zaremba, Fergus, & Gureckis, 2015).

2017,A Unified Model of Entropy and the Value of Information,"Notions of entropy and uncertainty are fundamental to many domains, ranging from the philosophy of science to physics. One important application is to quantify the expected usefulness of possible experiments (or questions or tests). Many different entropy models could be used; different models do not in general lead to the same conclusions about which tests (or experiments) are most valuable. It is often unclear whether this is due to different theoretical and practical goals or are merely due to historical accident. We introduce a unified two-parameter family of entropy models that incorporates a great deal of entropies as special cases. This family of models offers insight into heretofore perplexing psychological results, and generates predictions for future research.",>Jonathan D.

2017,Far Transfer: Does it Exist?,"Implementing interventions that are supposed to enhance students’ general learning skill and overall cognitive ability is still a common practice in education. Thus, it is assumed that there is far transfer – i.e., the generalization of a set of skills between domains loosely related to each other. In recent years, chess instruction, music instruction, and working memory training have been claimed to be able to train domain-general abilities (e.g., fluid reasoning/intelligence) which, in turn, generalize to other cognitive and academic skills (e.g., mathematics). We tested these claims in the population of healthy children via meta-analysis. The results showed small to moderate overall far-transfer effects in all the outcome measures of the three meta-analyses. Moreover, the effect sizes were inversely related to the design quality. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for education and expertise and extend the debate to another type of training, video games training.",>Giovanni Sala>Fernand Gobet,>University of Liverpool>University of Liverpool,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0287/index.html
2017,Scientific Sensemaking: A Critical Resource for Science Learning in School,"Science consists of both a body of knowledge and a process by which the knowledge is produced. Historically, these two aspects were often assessed separately (i.e., test items on knowledge and test items on skills) and taught relatively separately (e.g., with an introduction section on skills or via isolated projects or labs). The last decade has been marked by a substantial shift to an integrated view of both how science should be taught and how science learning should be assessed. Now, consensus reports (e.g., NRC, 2007, 2011) assert that scientific processes (renamed practices) should be used to learn science content (e.g., by designing, conducted, and interpreting experiments, or by arguing from existing sources). Further, new science standards (e.g., NGSS) strongly claim that science practices must be demonstrated in use with scientific content and that scientific content must be demonstrated through use with scientific practices.",>Christian Schunn,">University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0288/index.html

2017,The effects of gesture restriction on spatial language in young and elderly adults,"There is contradictory evidence on whether speech production gets impaired or enhanced when people are restrained from gesturing. There is also very little research on how this effect can change with aging. The present study sought evidence for these by asking young and elderly adults to describe two different routes on a map in spontaneous speech and when gestures were prohibited. We found that elderly adults produced more spatial language when they were restricted to use gestures compared to their spontaneous speech, whereas young adults produced comparable levels of spatial language in both conditions. Young and elderly adults used comparable levels of gestures in their spontaneous route descriptions. Yet, only young adults’ gesture use correlated positively with their spatial language production.

2017,The Effects of Duration Words and Spatial-Temporal Metaphors on Perceived Duration,"Subjective duration estimates are positively related to the magnitude of various non-temporal stimuli (e.g. Xuan et al., 2007). Our study investigated whether temporal and spatial magnitude information conveyed by linguistic stimuli would affect perceived duration in a temporal reproduction task. We used time-related words referring to different exact durations (e.g. second; Experiment 1), and spatial-temporal metaphors (e.g. long), referring to indistinct temporal as well as spatial magnitudes (Experiment 2). In both experiments, participants over-reproduced the shorter target duration (2.4 s) and under-reproduced the longer target duration (4.8 s). In Experiment 1, participants under-reproduced the longer target duration more when they saw “week” in the training and “year” in the reproduction. Yet, we did not observe the same semantic magnitude effect in other word pairs either in Experiment 1 or 2. Overall, we did not find supporting evidence for magnitude information conveyed by language affecting subjective time estimates.",>Demet Özer>Alexander Kranjec>Fuat Balcı>Tilbe Göksun,">Koç University, Istanbul, Turkey>Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States>Koç University, Istanbul, Turkey>Koç University, Istanbul, Turkey",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0291/index.html
2017,Action and actor gaze mismatch effects during spoken sentence processing,"Eye tracking research on situated language comprehension has shown that participants rely more on a recent event than on a plausible future event during spoken sentence comprehension. When people saw a recent action event and then they listened to a German (NP1-Verb-Adv-NP2) past or futuric present tense sentence, they preferentially looked at the recent event target over another plausible target object independent of tense. The present experiments extend this line of research by introducing incongruence (in Experiment 1 a past tense verb mismatched the recently seen action and in Experiment 2 an actor gaze cue mismatched the past tense sentence condition). Can the verb-action and the gaze-sentence mismatches eliminate the recent-event inspection preference? Results revealed inspection of the recent target as participants processed the verb-action mismatch (Exp 1) and actor gaze incongruence (Exp 2). However, only the gaze incongruence eliminated the overall recent event preference in the NP2 region.",>Dato Abashidze>Pia Knoeferle,">Humboldt University, Berlin>Humboldt University, Berlin",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0292/index.html

Despite the important insights gained from studying JA, there is little consensus regarding the specific components that are included in operationalizing JA. The present work explored a parameter space of JA during a dyadic naturalistic toy play task between 9-month-old infants and their parents. We systematically measured the temporal properties of two components commonly used to operationalize JA: the duration of continuous alignment of parent and infant visual fixations and the flexibility of fluctuations of attention. The results show that very brief bouts of JA are important predictors for vocabulary development. The results from this work provide new insights into the specific properties used to operationalize JA and point to the importance of considering multiple timescales of behavior that make up JA.",>Drew Abney>Linda Smith>Chen Yu,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0293/index.html
2017,The Role of Letter Frequency on Eye Movements in Sentential Pseudoword Reading,"For a language learner, any new word is a pseudoword. A pseudoword is a string of of letters or phonemes that sounds like an existing word in a language, though it has no meaning in the lexicon. On the other hand, speakers are well aware of permissible phonemes, their frequencies and collocations in their language due to the phonotactics inherent in the language. For example, saktal is a pseudoword in Turkish, whereas szyan is not, due to Turkish phonotactics. This study investigates the relationship between pseudoword letter formation and eye movement characteristics in reading. In particular, we examine the role of Turkish vowel harmony, middle-word consonant collocation, and word-initial and word-final consonants on eye movements with adult native speakers reading sentences that involve predesigned Turkish pseudowords. The results of an experiment with 34 participants are indicative of the role of pseudoword formation on a set of eye movement parameters.",>Cengiz Acartürk>Özkan Kılıç>Bilal Kırkıcı>Burcu Can>Ayşegül Özkan,">Middle East Technical University, Cognitive Science Program, Ankara, Turkey>Middle East Technical University, Cognitive Science Program, Ankara, Turkey>Middle East Technical University, Foreign Language Education  Ankara, Turkey>Hacettepe University,  Computer Engineering  Ankara, Turkey>Middle East Technical University, Cognitive Science Program, Ankara, Turkey",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0294/index.html

Yet little is known about how very young learners choose to allocate their time and attention during self-directed study. Using a recognition memory task, we investigate self-directed study in low-income preschoolers, who are at an age when attention, memory, and executive function skills rapidly develop and learning strategies emerge. By pre-exposing children to some items before self-directed study, we aimed to discover how familiarity modulates their study strategies. We found that children showed a preference for studying pre-exposed items. Overall, items studied longer led to increased recognition of those items at test. We also compared recognition task performance and strategies with measures of cognitive control skills, finding that children's selective attention skills support recognition performance.

2017,From Words to Sentences & Back: Characterizing Context-dependent Meaning Representations in the Brain,"Recent Machine Learning systems in vision and language processing have drawn attention to single-word vector spaces, where concepts are represented by a set of attributes based on textual and perceptual input. However, such representations still fall short from symbol grounding. In contrast, Grounded Cognition theories such as CAR (Concept Attribute Representation; Binder, 2009) provide a brain-based componential semantic representation. Building on this theory, this research aims to understand an intriguing effect of grounding, i.e. how word meaning changes depending on context. CAR representations of words are mapped to fMRI images of subjects reading different sentences, and the contributions of each word determined through Multiple Linear Regression and the FGREP neural network. As a result, the FGREP model identifies significant changes on the CARs for the same word used across sentences. In future work, such context-modified word vectors could be used as representations for a more robust natural language processing system.",>Nora E Aguirre-Celis>Manuel Valenzuela-Rendon>Risto Miikkulainen,">Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Monterrey, Mexico & University of Texas in Austin, Austin, Texas, United States>Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Monterrey, Mexico >University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.

2017,The Influence of Pop-Culture on Misattribution of Memory,"Social media provides a source for transmitting information that can become widely accepted. However, during this process of transmission, information becomes susceptible to distortion. In this study, we assessed people’s semantic (i.e., prior expectations) and recognition memory for pop-culture content, as a function of confidence and perceived information source. In Experiment 1, we investigated semantic memory for ubiquitous movie quotes (e.g., the famous Star Wars quote “Luke I am your father”). Notably this quote is incorrect, but we found that a majority of participants accepted these lure quotes as true with high confidence and indicated they experienced the original source. In Experiment 2, participants viewed the original sources before a recognition test of the quotes. We found that while there was some improvement, people still preferred the lure quote with high confidence.

The model was tested against all problems from the standard paper folding task and achieved a perfect score, illustrating that visual-imagery-based representations and operations are sufficiently expressive to capture at least one successful solution strategy. Although the model does not closely resemble human cognitive processing, and thus should not be considered in its current form to be a plausible psychological model of human task performance, the assumptions made and their implications for our understanding of human cognition on the paper folding task point to fruitful lines of future work towards this goal.",>James Ainooson>Maithilee Kunda,>Vanderbilt University>Vanderbilt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0298/index.html

However, in studying human interaction, separating these two contexts leads to theories that have low ecological validity: they do not generalize well to our real lives outside of the lab. Our proposed improvement is to use key research practices of formal inductive methods such as conversation analysis (CA) during the process of discovering new regularities by first looking at natural data without being prejudiced by theory. This may remind readers of the questionable research practice of HARKing (Hypothesizing After The Results are Known). We argue that using carefully calibrated forms of 'legal HARKing' systematically and transparently in our exploratory research methods, we can achieve more robust and ecologically valid theories.",>Saul Albert>J.p.

Using cross-modal semantic fragment priming we tested the following: (a) Do monolingual speakers of Swedish use tonal accent information during lexical access? (b) Do bilingual speakers, who grew up with one tonal (Swedish) and one non-tonal language, treat this feature the same way as monolinguals? Our results show that for monolinguals, accent mispronunciations eliminate priming effects, implying that tone is used during lexical access. For bilinguals, by contrast, mispronunciation sensitivity depends on both the accent type and its distribution across the linguistic input, as well as on the lexical neighbourhood.",>Nadja Althaus>Allison Wetterlin>Aditi Lahiri,">University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom>University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway>University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0301/index.html
2017,Semantic Networks Generated from Early Linguistic Input,"Semantic networks generated from different word corpora show common structural characteristics, including high degrees of clustering, short average path lengths, and scale-free degree distributions. Previous research has disagreed about whether these features emerge from internally- or externally- driven properties (i.e. words already in the lexicon vs. regularities in the external world), mapping onto preferential attachment and preferential acquisition accounts, respectively (Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005; Hills, Maouene, Maouene, Sheya, & Smith, 2009). Such accounts suggest that inherent semantic structure shapes new lexical growth. We extend previous work by creating semantic networks using the SEEDLingS corpus, a newly collected corpus of linguistic input to infants. Using a recently developed LSA-like approach (GLoVe vectors), we confirm the presence of previously reported structural characteristics, but only in certain ranges of semantic similarity space. Our results confirm the robustness of certain aspects of network organization, and provide novel evidence in support of preferential acquisition accounts.",>Andrei Amatuni>Elika Bergelson,>Duke University>Duke University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0302/index.html
2017,Analogical Abstraction in Three-Month-Olds,"This research tests whether analogical processing ability is present in 3-month-old infants. Infants are habituated to a series of analogous pairs, instantiating either same (e.g., AA, BB) or different (e.g., AB, CD), then tested with further exemplars of the relations. If they can distinguish the familiar relation from the novel relation, even with new objects, this is evidence for analogical abstraction across the pairs. In Experiment 1, we did not find evidence of analogical abstraction when 3-month-olds habituated to six pairs instantiating the relation. However, in Experiment 2, infants showed evidence of analogical abstraction after habituation to two alternating pairs (e.g., AA, BB, AA, BB…). As with older groups, rendering individual objects salient disrupted relational learning. These results demonstrate that 3-month-old infants are capable of analogical comparison and abstraction. Our findings also place limits on the conditions under which these processes occur.

Only studies using novel visual categories and behavioral measures were included. The results strongly suggest that the phenomenon is robust but that the studies are somewhat underpowered. We argue that this is problematic because it renders both statistically significant and nonsignificant results very difficult to interpret, which impedes progress in understanding the learned CP phenomenon, for example, why expansion vs. compression is observed, or boundary vs. dimensional effects.

In this work, we study human cheating behavior through simulated examinations in virtual reality, showing that the teacher’s animacy and orientation plays a large part in the student’s reasoning of the teacher’s awareness.

2017,Against the group actor assumption in joint action research,"A central assumption in joint action research is that in order to explain how individuals act as part of a group, we must first explain how the group comes into existence. This assumption has led to an unnecessarily narrow research programme: research has focussed largely on interpersonal coordination mechanisms. I outline an alternative approach predicated on a dynamic conception of the ecosystem. On this view, there is no need to assume that actors must first constitute a group agent with their fellows before entering into coordinated action. Such coordination can be more efficiently explained by recognizing that all actions perturb the structure of the ecosystem itself in a manner that can alter the action possibilities available to neighbouring actors. This move allows us to overcome entrenched debates over the nature of shared intentionality, and to instead focus on practical interventions in multi-actor settings.",>Ed Baggs>Ed Baggs,">University College London, London, United Kingdom>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0307/index.html

Although our study found general effects of motivated reasoning, we failed to replicate Kahan et al.’s “motivated numeracy effect”. However, our study did find that, when forced to consider competing statistical interpretations of the data before responding, highly numerate participants were more likely than less numerate ones to choose a correct but belief-contradicting interpretation of data.

However, the nature of the mental processes leading to change in opinion is up for debate. Different accounts of how people process evidence and then update their beliefs make different predictions, especially about one-sided evidence, which is rarely examined. We presented subjects with multiple text arguments regarding socio-political topics as one-sided or mixed evidence. Participants rated arguments differently according to their extant beliefs, which is consistent with accounts of motivated reasoning. They did not polarize afterward, instead showing evidence of belief updating according to Bayesian principles: belief change is sensitive to prior opinions and to the direction and quality of the evidence presented.

In a first experiment (N=1010) we showed that people’s moral judgments depend on the Digital Context (Smartphone vs. PC) in which a dilemma is presented, becoming more utilitarian (vs. deontological) when using Smartphones. To provide additional evidence, we ran a second (N=250) and a third experiment (N=300), where we introduced time constraints and we manipulated time instructions. Our results provide an extended perspective on Dual-Process Models of Moral Judgment, as we showed that the use of smartphones, often assumed to be hurried which would be consistent with gut-feeling decision-making, increased the likelihood of utilitarian responses and decreased deontological ones. This is the first study to look at the impact of the digital age on moral judgments and the results presented have consequences for understanding moral choice in our increasingly virtualized world.",>Albert Barque-Duran>Emmanuel Pothos>James Yearsley>James Hampton,">City, University of London, London, United Kingdom>City, University of London, London, United Kingdom>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States>City, University of London, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0311/index.html

Results suggested that pure integration (with no storage load) could predict Gf, but no difference was found between coordination and integration. Experiment 2 employed the Arithmetic Chain Task (ACT), again with modifications to storage load. Results support replication of LST findings, though a distinction was found between coordination and integration when storage material could not be easily rehearsed.

In order to test this hypothesis, we ran a behavioral and an ERP (Event Related Potential) study, with specific interest in the N400 component as an indicator of semantic processing. We compared three groups of participants who did a match/mismatch task with the only difference being that the labels would appear before, after or simultaneously with the pictures. Not surprisingly, the hardest condition was the one with two information presented simultaneously. The amplitude of the N400 was more prominent when labels were presented after the pictures in comparison to the condition where labels preceded picture presentation, suggesting that this second experimental situation led to smaller violation of expectation for our participants (word to picture condition) in comparison to mapping pictures to words.",>Jelena Batinic>Andrej Savic>Vanja Kovic,">Laboratory for Neurocognition and Applied Cognition, University of Belgrade, Serbia>University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering>Laboratory for Neurocognition and Applied Cognition, University of Belgrade, Serbia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0313/index.html

Scientific reasoning was measured by a standardized test of science achievement. A principal components analysis found that the three EFs were separable. Different EFs predicted different aspects of cognitive flexibility; notably, participants with poor shifting ability made more perseverative errors. Both EF and WCST predicted science achievement. Of note was the finding that better updating (i.e., working memory) was associated with higher science scores. These findings illuminate the role of EF in cognitive flexibility and scientific reasoning, and point the way to future studies of the effect of training EF on science achievement.",>Drake Bauer>Sashank Varma>Keisha Varma>Martin Van Boekel>Alyssa Worley>Jean-Baptiste Quillien>Tayler Loiselle>Purav Patel,>University of Minnesota>University of Minnesota>University of Minnesota>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Minnesota>University of Minnesota>University of Minnesota>University of Minnesota,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0314/index.html
2017,Contrasts in reasoning about omissions,"Omissions figure prominently in causal reasoning from diagnosis to ascriptions of negligence. One philosophical proposal posits that omissions are accompanied by a contrasting alternative that describes a case of orthodox (nonomissive) causation (Schaffer, 2005; Bernstein, 2014). A psychological hypothesis can be drawn from this contrast view of omissions: by default, humans should interpret omissive causations as representing at least two possibilities, i.e., a possibility representing the omission and a possibility representing a contrast. The theory of mental models supposes that reasoners construct only one possibility (the omission) by default, and that they consider separate alternative possibilities in sequential order. Two experiments test the contrast hypothesis against the model theory, and find evidence in favor of the model-theoretic account.",>Paul Bello>Christina Wasylyshyn>Gordon Briggs>Sangeet Khemlani,">Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA>Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, District of Columbia, United States>Naval Research Laboratory>Naval Research Laboratory",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0315/index.html
2017,Representing time in terms of space: Directions of mental timelines in Norwegian,"People often use spatial vocabulary to describe temporal relations, and this has increasingly motivated attempts to map spatial frames of reference (FoRs) onto time. How people assign FRONT to time and to temporal entities depends on cultural conventions, and is crucial for diagnosing which temporal FoR a person actually adopts. Here, we report findings from a survey with speakers of Norwegian that aimed at assessing the cultural conventions involved in FRONT assignment. Data on temporal movements of events, on the temporal order of events, and on explicit FRONT assignments to events, time units, and “time itself” suggest that participants use different principles for describing fixed relations (static time) versus moving events (dynamic time).",>Andrea Bender>Kristin Sjåfjell>Annelie Rothe-Wulf>Sieghard Beller,">University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway>University of Bergen, Norway>University of Freiburg>University of Bergen, Norway",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0316/index.html
2017,A Bayesian model of knowledge and metacognitive control: Applications to opt-in tasks,"In many ecologically situated cognitive tasks, participants engage in self-selection of the particular stimuli they choose to evaluate or test themselves on. This contrasts with a traditional experimental approach in which an experimenter has complete control over the participant's experience. Considering these two situations jointly provides an opportunity to understand why participants opt in to some stimuli or tasks but not to others. We present here a Bayesian model of cognitive and metacognitive processes that uses latent contextual knowledge to model how learners use knowledge to make opt-in decisions. We leverage the model to describe how performance on self-selected stimuli relates to performance on true experimental tasks that deny learners the opportunity for self-selection. We illustrate the utility of the approach with an application to a general-knowledge answering task.",>Stephen Bennett>Aaron Benjamin>Mark Steyvers,">University of California, Irvine>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0317/index.html
2017,Modality Switch Effects Emerge Early and Increase throughout Conceptual Processing: Evidence from ERPs,"We tested whether conceptual processing is modality-specific by tracking the time course of the Conceptual Modality Switch effect. Forty-six participants verified the relation between property words and concept words. The conceptual modality of consecutive trials was manipulated in order to produce an Auditory-to-visual switch condition, a Haptic-to-visual switch condition, and a Visual-to-visual, no-switch condition. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to the onset of the first word (property) in the target trials so as to measure the effect online and to avoid a within-trial confound. A switch effect was found, characterized by more negative ERP amplitudes for modality switches than no-switches. It proved significant in four typical time windows from 160 to 750 milliseconds post word onset, with greater strength in posterior brain regions, and after 350 milliseconds. These results suggest that conceptual processing may be modality-specific in certain tasks, but also that the early stage of processing is relatively amodal.",>Pablo Bernabeu>Roel Willems>Max Louwerse,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0318/index.html

Our framework combines insights regarding object and concept representation in semantic memory research with multiattribute choice rules proposed by scholars of decision making. We also outline computational techniques for using our framework to quantitatively predict naturalistic multiattribute choices. We test our approach in two-object and three-object forced choice experiments involving common books, movies, and foods. Despite using complex naturalistic stimuli, we find that our approach achieves high predictive accuracy rates, and is also able to provide a good account of decision time distributions.",>Sudeep Bhatia>Neil Stewart,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0319/index.html

The transmission over three generations of pairs of participants occurred under two conditions. In the interactive condition, transmissions over generations occurred in face-to-face conversations, whereas in the non-interactive condition, generations video-recorded their instructions to the next generations. We analyzed the effects of verbal and embodied features of informational transfer on task performance. Our results show that performances improved over generations regardless of interactivity.

This fMRI study investigates the extent to which ambiguity-related activation in IFG is modulated by the specific cognitive-linguistic demands posed by the modality in which a sentence is presented. In the present study, ambiguous sentences and matched unambiguous sentences were presented in three conditions: listening, reading, and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). The RSVP modality elicited stronger ambiguity-related haemodynamic responses than the other two modalities, particularly in left anterior IFG.

2017,Generalized Representation of Syntactic Structures,"Language analysis provides important insights into psychological properties of individuals and groups. While the majority of language analysis work has focused on semantics, psychological information is encoded not just in semantics, but also in syntax. We propose Conversation Level Syntax Similarity Metric-Group Representations(CASSIM-GR). This tool builds generalized representations of syntactic structures of documents, thus allowing researchers to distinguish between people and groups based on syntactic differences. CASSIM-GR applies spectral clustering to syntactic similarity matrices and calculates the center of each cluster. This resulting cluster centroid then represents the syntactical structure of the group of documents. To examine the effectiveness of CASSIM-GR, we conduct three experiments across three corpora. In each experiment, we calculate the clustering accuracy and compare our proposed technique to bag-of-words approach. Our results provide evidence for the effectiveness of CASSIM-GR and demonstrate that combining syntactic similarity and tf-idf semantic information improves the total accuracy of group classification.",>Reihane Boghrati>Kate Johnson>Morteza Dehghani,">University of Southern California, los angeles>University of Southern California , Los Angeles , California, United States>University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0322/index.html

Coercion sentences in need of aspectual enrichment were embedded in discourse contexts providing the necessary information for successful interpretation. The findings of the reported experiment show that context information can be used immediately without disrupting reading of coercion sentences. The lack of coercion costs in supportive discourse contexts provides experimental evidence for the proposed Composition in Context Hypothesis and against theories that view semantic composition as largely encapsulated from context. Furthermore, the present experiment investigated the role of inter-individual differences in verbal working memory capacity on the immediate use of contextual information in computing coerced interpretations.",>Oliver Bott,">Project CiC, XPrag.de, Tübingen University, Tübingen, Baden Württemberg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0323/index.html
2017,The Structure of Goal Systems Predicts Human Performance,"Psychological theories attribute people’s failure to achieve their goals to insufficient motivation. We offer a complementary explanation that emphasizes the complexity of the computational problems that arise from the structure of people’s goal systems. We hypothesize that people’s capacity to achieve their goals can be predicted from combinatorial parameters of the structure of the network connecting their goals to the means available to pursue them. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the relationship between goals and means as a network where edges between means and goals indicate which means can be used to achieve which goals. This allowed us to map two computational challenges that arise in goal achievement onto two NP-hard problems: Set Cover and Maximum Coverage. The connection between goal pursuit and NP-hard problems led us to predict that people should perform better with goal systems that are tree-like. Three behavioral experiments confirmed this prediction.",>David Bourgin>Falk Lieder>Daniel Reichman>Nimrod Talmon>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>Weizmann Institute of Science,>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0324/index.html
2017,The Effects of Autonomy on Emotions and Learning in Game-Based Learning Environments,"We examined the impact of autonomy on college students’ emotions and learning with a game-based learning environment (GBLE). 96 undergraduate students participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions based on the level of control granted during gameplay. Results revealed participants in the partial agency condition achieved the highest proportional learning gains (PLG), after controlling for session duration. There was a positive correlation between evidence scores of four emotions and PLG within the partial agency condition. A stepwise multiple regression showed anger as the best and sole predictor of PLG. Implications include understanding the role of autonomy and emotions during learning and problem-solving with GBLEs designed to foster scientific thinking in STEM. The current study suggests that although GBLEs offer significant learning benefits they also induce several basic and learning–centered emotions that can either facilitate or inhibit learning gains which require further examination.",>Amanda Bradbury>Michelle Taub>Roger Azevedo,">North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States>North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States>North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0325/index.html

2017,Effects of transmission perturbation in the cultural evolution of language,"Two factors seem to play a major role in the cultural evolution of language. On the one hand, there is pressure towards efficient transfer of information. On the other hand, languages are learned repeatedly and will therefore show traces of systematic stochastic disturbances of the transmission of linguistic knowledge. A lot of attention has been paid to the effects of learning biases on the transmission of language, but there is reason to expect that the class of relevant transmission perturbations is much larger. This paper therefore explores some potential effects of transmission noise due to errors in the observation of states of the world. We look at three case studies on vagueness, meaning deflation, and underspecified lexical meaning. These studies suggest that transmission perturbations other than learning biases might help explain attested linguistic patterns and that perturbations due to perceptual noise may even produce effects very similar to learning biases.",>Thomas Brochhagen>Michael Franke,>University of Amsterdam (ILLC)>University of Tübingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0327/index.html

Color-related concepts help with color discrimination,"Color is a critical part of objects representation as well as critical cue for recognizing objects. However, it is less clear how people represent color in memory. The present study aimed at investigating this issue. We designed a procedure based on short-term sensory memory load procedure mixed with a color-priming paradigm. Participants learned three visual stimuli (either non-words – lexical load - or visual-shapes – visual-shape load). Then, they performed a color discrimination task on colored patch (e.g.,a yellow patch). Each target was preceded by a color-related concept word either congruent (e.g., word “banana”) or not (e.g., word “lettuce”). Finally, they performed a recognition task either on non-words or on visual-shapes depending on the memory load condition). We showed that color-priming effect was selectively disrupted in visual-shape load condition. We interpreted this finding as an evidence that automatic modal simulations occur during access to the meaning of color-related concept.",>Lionel Brunel>Philippe Servajean>Loic Heurley>Nicolas Vermeulen,">Department of Psychology, Epsylon Laboratory, University Paul Valéry>Department of Psychology, Epsylon Laboratory, University Paul Valéry>Department STAPS, CeRSM Laboratory, University Paris X>Research Institute for Psychological Sciences, Université catholique de Louvain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0328/index.html

Children can formulate algorithms that do not require loops (Bucciarelli et al., 2016), and anecdotal evidence suggests that they can understand loops. As there were no previous studies, we examined how they made deductions of the consequences of loops, and how they abduced loops in creating informal algorithms in everyday language. We therefore tested fifth-grade children’s ability carry out both these tasks in algorithms that rearrange the order of cars on a toy railway track with one siding. Experiment 1 showed that they could deduce rearrangements from algorithms containing loops, and Experiment 2 showed that they could formulate at least some algorithms that contained loops.

However, it is unclear whether these semantic and syntactic processes interact. We examined the extent to which animacy-semantic role mappings in dative prime sentences and target scenes influenced choice of syntactic structure. 143 participants (47 three-year-olds, 48 five-year-olds and 48 adults) alternated with the experimenter in describing animations. Animacy mappings for themes and goals were either prototypical or non-prototypical and either matched or mismatched across the experimenter’s prime scenes and participants’ target elicitation scenes. Primes were either double-object datives or prepositional datives. Participants’ target sentences were coded for syntactic form. All age groups showed a main structural priming effect. For the youngest group, animacy-semantic role mappings facilitated prepositional dative priming. No animacy facilitation was found for the older groups.

2017,Equiprobability principle or “no change” principle? Examining reasoning in the Monty Hall Dilemma using unequal probabilities,"The Monty Hall Dilemma (MHD) is a well-known cognitive illusion. It is often claimed that one reason for the incorrect answers is that people apply the equiprobability principle: they assume that the probability of the two remaining options must be equal. An alternative explanation for assigning the same probabilities to options is that they had the same prior probabilities and people perceive no significant change. Standard MHD versions do not distinguish these possibilities, but a version with unequal prior probabilities could. Participants were given an unequal probabilities version of MHD and told that either the high or low probability option had been eliminated. This affected participants’ choices and their posterior probabilities. Only 14% of participants’ responses were consistent with applying the equiprobability principle, but 51% were consistent with a “no change” principle. Participants were sensitive to the implications of the prior probabilities but did not appear to use Bayesian updating.",>Bruce Burns,>University of Sydney,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0331/index.html
2017,Discovering simple heuristics from mental simulation,"In the history of cognitive science, there have been two competing philosophies regarding how people reason about the world. In one, people rely on rich, generative models to make predictions about a wide range of scenarios; while in the other, people have a large ""bag of tricks"", idiosyncratic heuristics that tend to work well in practice. In this paper, we suggest that rather than being in opposition to one another, these two ideas complement each other. We argue that people's capacity for mental simulation may support their ability to learn new cue-based heuristics, and demonstrate this phenomenon in two experiments. However, our results also indicate that participants are far less likely to learn a heuristic when there is no logical or explicitly conveyed relationship between the cue and the relevant outcome.

The model operates at the algorithmic level combining information concerning word probabilities and sentence lengths, representing a first attempt to model UID as resulting from underlying factors during language production.

They have the ability to create semantic structures from concepts they acquire, they can learn appropriate inductive biases that are later used as priors for different tasks and they can learn novel categories from very few examples. While recent advances in neural networks and other machine learning methods are beginning to approach human-level capabilities in several tasks, building computational models that replicate these abilities has proven difficult. We propose a model that combines powerful features extracted from a deep neural network with a semantic structure inferred using probabilistic Hierarchical Bayes. We test and demonstrate the capabilities of our model in three different tasks: learning a new concept from a single example of a novel category, learning new categories from few examples of different categories, and learning the semantic tree from an unlabeled set of novel objects.",>Andres Campero>Andrew Francl>Joshua B.

2017,The paradox of relational development is not universal: Abstract reasoning develops differently across cultures,"Recent studies demonstrate a puzzling decline in relational reasoning during development. Specifically, 3-year-olds fail in a relational match-to-sample (RMTS) task, while younger children (18-30 months) succeed (Walker, Bridgers, & Gopnik, 2016). Hoyos, Shao, and Gentner (2016) propose that older children fail because of a bias toward individual object properties induced by “avid noun learning.” If this is the case, children learning a language with a stronger emphasis on verbs, like Mandarin Chinese, may show an attenuated decline in relational reasoning. We first test this possibility by reproducing the causal RMTS task in China, and find that Mandarin-speaking 3-year-olds outperform their English-speaking peers in the U.S. In a second experiment, we show that Mandarin speakers exhibit a corresponding bias toward relational solutions while English speakers prefer object-based solutions in an ambiguous context.

However, most studies that have predicted personality traits using computational linguistic methods have focused on lexicon-based information. We investigate to what extent the performance of lexicon-based and grammar-based methods compare when predicting personality traits. We analyzed a corpus of student essays and their personality traits using two lexicon-based approaches, one top-down (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)), one bottom-up (topic models) and one grammar-driven approach (Biber model), as well as combinations of these models. Results showed that the performance of the models and their combinations demonstrated similar performance, showing that lexicon-based top-down models and bottom-up models do not differ, and neither do lexicon-based models and grammar-based models. Moreover, combination of models did not improve performance. These findings suggest that predicting personality traits from text remains difficult, but that the performance from lexicon-based and grammar-based models are on par.",>Maira B. Carvalho>Max M.

Evidence from bilingual infants and toddlers in Malaysia.,"Early vocabularies in most languages tend to contain more nouns than verbs. Yet, the strength of this noun bias has been observed to vary across languages and cultures. Two main hypotheses have aimed at explaining such variations; either that the relative importance of nouns vs. verbs is language- specific, or that socio-cultural influences shape early vocabulary structures. The present study compares the relative distribution of verbs and nouns, in English, between two groups of bilingual infants and toddlers; Malay-English and Mandarin- English. We found that early English lexicons of Mandarin- English bilinguals contained more verbs than in the English lexicon of Malay-English bilinguals, in both comprehension and production.

There is debate over whether reading instruction should focus on the relations between print and sound or between print and meaning. In an artificial word learning study using adults, Taylor, Davis, and Rastle (2017) compared sound focused or meaning focused training, demonstrating that sound training was superior for learning to read. However, a benefit from sound focused training is likely dependent on prior acquisition of effective sound to meaning relations of words. To explore this, we developed a connectionist model of reading. We exposed the model to sound or meaning focused training, but varied the model’s pre-acquired oral language skills. The results showed that proficiency in oral language is a determinant of the advantage of print to sound focused training, indicating that reading training should address both oral language skills and print to sound mappings.",>Ya-Ning Chang>J.

Recent machine learning methods for deriving vector-space embeddings of words (e.g., word2vec) have achieved considerable success in natural language processing. These vector spaces have also been shown to exhibit a surprising capacity to capture verbal analogies, with similar results for natural images, giving new life to a classic model of analogies as parallelograms that was first proposed by cognitive scientists. We evaluate the parallelogram model of analogy as applied to modern word embeddings, providing a detailed analysis of the extent to which this approach captures human relational similarity judgments in a large benchmark dataset. We find that that some semantic relationships are better captured than others. We then provide evidence for deeper limitations of the parallelogram model based on the intrinsic geometric constraints of vector spaces, paralleling classic results for first-order similarity.",>Dawn Chen>Joshua Peterson>Tom Griffiths,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0340/index.html

Here, we set out to explore anticipation of a stimulus after implicit distributional learning. We hypothesize that as people learn the category frequency information implicitly, response times will scale according to the relative frequency of the stimulus category. Twelve adult participants viewed photographs of faces, tools, and buildings while performing a simple classification task. We found that response times significantly decreased with greater frequencies in the distribution of stimulus categories. This result suggested that distributional information about the internal representations of the stimuli could be learned and indicated the possibility that participants anticipated the stimuli proportional to the probability of the category appearing and thereby reduced response times for the more frequent categories.",>Danlei Chen>Carol Jew>Benjamin Zinszer>Rajeev Raizada,">University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States>University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States>University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States>University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0341/index.html

Young children rapidly develop the ability to enact fairness, but the cognitive underpinnings of this ability remain unknown. The present study investigated 4-7-year-olds’ acquisition of three principles of fairness -- equality (the principle that all parties should have the same), merit (the principle that those who work harder should get more), and starting opportunity (the principle that those who started with less should get more) -- in relation to their emerging cognitive control and memory for numerical information (numerical accuracy). Cognitive control predicted children’s equal sharing, whereas numerical accuracy predicted merit-based sharing. Children up through the oldest age we tested ignored starting opportunities.

We recruited 24 younger and 24 older adults, and asked them to choose between medications that differed in probabilities and outcomes of treatment success. Participants chose between a risky option and a sure option that had equal expected values (risk-neutral) and between a risky option and a sure option that had a lower expected value (risk-advantageous). Participants completed the decision task first individually (pre-collaboration), then in dyads (collaboration), and once again individually (post-collaboration). During pre-collaboration older adults showed a smaller increase in risk-taking tendency in response to risk-advantageous trials compared to younger adults. Older adults’ risk preferences converged towards their partner’s preference to a greater extent following collaboration relative to younger adults. These findings highlight the importance of designing decision aids for older adults, and considering how social processes influence patients’ medication decisions.",>Amy Wing-Lam Chong>Michael Bixter>Wendy Rogers,>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0344/index.html
2017,Finding Creative New Ideas: Human-Centric Mindset Overshadows Mind-Wandering,"Finding creative new ideas requires both release from fixation and a productive search mindset. Recent research has shown that messy desks, walking, and mind-wandering can lead to more new uses for old objects. Here we show that a human-centric mindset is superior to mind-wandering for generating more alternative uses and more creative uses because it provides both release from fixation and an effective search strategy. A human-centric mindset entails perspective-taking, and perspective-taking is likely to be an effective general strategy for enhancing creativity, problem-solving and innovation.",>Yung-Yi Juliet Chou>Barbara Tversky,>Columbia University>Columbia University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0345/index.html
2017,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and the Face Inversion Effect: Anodal stimulation at Fp3 reduces recognition for upright faces,"Perceptual learning is a key perceptual skill that people possess, in particular, it contributes to their ability to distinguish between faces thus recognize individuals. Recently, we showed that anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) at Fp3 abolishes the inversion effect (that would otherwise exist) for familiar checkerboards created from a prototype. Because of the close analogy between the inversion effect obtained with checkerboards, which we use as a marker for perceptual learning, and the traditional face inversion effect (upright faces recognized better than inverted ones), we investigated the effects of anodal tDCS at Fp3 during an old/new recognition task for upright and inverted faces. Results showed that stimulation significantly reduced the face inversion effect compared to controls. The effect was strongest in reducing recognition performance to upright faces. This result supports our account of perceptual learning and its role as a key factor in face recognition.",>Ciro Civile>Sukhvinder Obhi>Ipl McLaren,">McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada>McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada>University of Exeter, Exeter, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0346/index.html
2017,Beliefs about sparsity affect causal experimentation,"What is the best way of figuring out which variables can cause some outcome of interest? One prominent normative proposal is that learners should manipulate each candidate variable in isolation to avoid receiving confounding information. Here, we demonstrate that this strategy is not always the most efficient method for learning about a causal system. Using an optimal learner model, we show that when a causal system is sparse, that is, when the outcome of interest has few or even just one actual cause among the candidate variables, it is actually more efficient to test multiple variables at once. In a series of behavioral experiments, we then show that people are sensitive to causal sparsity when planning causal experiments.",>Anna Coenen>Neil Bramley>Azzurra Ruggeri>Todd Gureckis,">New York University>New York University>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany>New York University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0347/index.html

S-languages conveying manner of motion directly in a main verb, while V-languages require a separate verb. This difference has been shown to influence the conceptualization and narration of motion events. We therefore asked: would this difference arise in the paths that people draw, particularly in visual narratives? We annotated the representations of path information (source, trajectory, goal) in a corpus of 35 comics from S- and V-languages. We found that panels from S-languages depicted the path of an action more often than those from V-languages, consistent with previous research on increased motion event salience for S-languages. These findings suggest that the conceptualization of paths from spoken language may influence the graphic depiction of paths.",>Neil Cohn>Vivian Wong>Kaitlin Pederson>Ryan Taylor,">Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0348/index.html

We found that the prior credibility of a causal explanation plays a central role in explanatory reasoning: first, because of the presence of strong main effects on judgments of explanatory power, and second, because of the gate-keeping role prior credibility has for other factors. Highly credible explanations were not susceptible to causal framing effects. Instead, highly credible hypotheses were sensitive to the generalizability of an explanation. While these results yield a more nuanced understanding of the determinants of judgments of explanatory power, they also illuminate the close relationship between prior beliefs and explanatory power and the relationship between abductive and probabilistic reasoning.",>Matteo Colombo>Leandra Bucher>Jan Sprenger,">Tilbug Center  for Logic and Philosophy of Science, University of Tilburg>Bergische Universität Wuppertal>TiLPS",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0350/index.html

PACKER's core design assumptions are (1) categories are represented as exemplars in a multidimensional psychological space, (2) generated items should be similar to exemplars of the same category, and (3) generated categories should be dissimilar to existing categories.

2017,Opening Up and Closing Down Discussion: Experimenting with Epistemic Status in Conversation,"Managing disagreement in conversation requires subtle linguistic and pragmatics skills. One key dimension is the degree of `knowingness' with which people present their stance on an issue. It has been hypothesised that framing stances as `knowing', i.e. with higher implied levels of speaker certainty limits the potential for challenge by others. We present the first experimental test of this hypothesis. Using a text based chat-tool paradigm and a debating task we are able to systematically manipulate how `knowing' people's turns appear to one-another. The results show that `knowing' stances tend to close off discussion leading to less carefully formulated, truncated turns, but do not reliably affect the range of solutions considered. Unknowing stances, by contrast, do not affect turn length or formulation but do encourage more deliberation and include more signals of certainty in the message contents.",>Shauna Concannon>Patrick Healey>Matthew Purver,">Queen Mary University of London, London, England>Queen Mary University of London, London, England>Queen Mary University of London, London, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0352/index.html
2017,But where’s the evidence? The effect of explanatory corrections on inferences about false information,"Research on the continued influence effect has consistently shown that people continue to rely on false causal information despite being corrected by more recent information. Corrections are most effective when paired with an alternative explanation that ‘fills the causal gap’ left by the correction. However, it may not always be possible provide an alternative explanation. Previous research suggests people more readily discount unreliable information. Two experiments examined whether corrections to false causal information in a news report are more effective when the correction explains why the source of the false information was unreliable. The results showed that a correction did not fully eliminate reliance on false information and that an explanatory correction was no more effective than a non-explanatory correction. People also continued to rely on false information when there was limited information to support its validity. Possible explanations for the ineffectiveness of explanatory corrections are discussed.",>Saoirse Connor Desai>Stian Reimers,">City, University of London>City, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0353/index.html

We consider the possibility that relational concepts can also be represented unitarily, whereby the concept is a property of the stimulus as a whole. The distinction between compositional and unitary representations of relational concepts is a natural consequence of structure-mapping theory, but its psychological implications have not been explored. We report two experiments in which we examine how encouraging subjects to represent relational concepts compositionally versus unitarily affects learning on classification- and inference-based category learning tasks. Our findings show that unitary representations lead to better learning than compositional representations, especially for the inference task. We conclude that unitary representations incur less cognitive load than structural alignment of compositional representations, and thus may be the default for everyday relational reasoning.",>Daniel Corral>Matt Jones,">University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado, United States>University of Colorado Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0354/index.html

However, little is known about what influences our partner models in spoken interactions with artificial partners. In our experiment we asked people to name 15 British landmarks, and estimate their identifiability to a person as well as an automated conversational agent of either British or American origin. Our results show that people’s assumptions about what an artificial partner knows are related to their estimates of what other people are likely to know - but they generally estimate artificial partners to have more knowledge in the task than human partners. These findings shed light on the way in which people build partner models of artificial partners. Importantly, they suggest that people use assumptions about what other humans know as a heuristic when assessing an artificial partner’s knowledge.",>Benjamin R.

Across four studies, using a speeded reaction time task, we found that self-reports of felt emotion were delayed relative to reports of event-directed moral judgments (e.g. badness) and were no faster than person-directed moral judgments (e.g. blame).

In the first experiment, using a foot-press response dispositive, we found a SRC effect between the orientation of the graspable part of the presented object and the laterality of the response. In Experiment 2a, we showed that constraining the subject hands in a given position (i.e., a Lego hand shape) during the same task interfered with the SRC effect. In Experiment 2b, participants performed a short training phase with their hands constrained before performing the experiment. This resulted in an inversion of the direction of the SRC effect previously observed.

Small differences in the force used to toss a coin should not affect this uncertainty. However, the voluntary movement involved in tossing a coin is subject to motivational influences arising from the anticipation of the value of the outcome of the toss. Presented here are measurements of hand velocities during coin tossing when the outcomes entail monetary gains and losses. Finger position measurements show that hand velocities are proportional to the amount of money at stake.

Dyads took part in a referential communication game and were allocated to one of three experimental settings. Each of these settings elicited a different perspective mindset (none, self-focus, other-focus). In the two perspective settings, speakers were explicitly instructed to regard their addressee’s (other-focus) or their own (self-focus) perspective before construing their referential message. Results indicated that eliciting speakers’ self- versus other-focus did not influence their reference production. We did find that speakers with an elicited egocentric perspective reported a higher perspective-taking tendency than speakers in the other two settings. This tendency correlated with actual referring behavior during the game, indicating that speakers who reported a high perspective-taking tendency were less likely to make egocentric errors such as leaking information privileged to speakers themselves.

Results did show sex-group interactions for IGT scores. In decision learning model simulations, it was found that different models were more appropriate to explain the task performance for different sex-group pairs. Overall, women showed more of an ability to integrate the additive negative signals from the stimuli to make more advantageous decisions than the men; consequently, this made the men more resilient to the negative effects of the positive stimuli on task-performance.

In this study, we examine the extent that differences between self-explanations and think-alouds can be detected using computational textual indices derived from dialogism. Students (n = 68) read a text about natural selection and were instructed to generate self-explanations or think-alouds. The linguistic features of these text responses were analyzed using ReaderBench, an automated text analysis tool. A discriminant function analysis using these features correctly classified 80.9% of the students’ assigned experimental conditions (self-explanation vs. think aloud).

Since people encounter many closely related distributions, a computationally efficient strategy is to selectively reuse computations - either the samples themselves or some summary statistic. We refer to these reuse strategies as amortized inference. In two experiments, we present evidence consistent with amortization. When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, we show that answers to the second query vary systematically depending on the structure of the first query.

A new process model - the causal sampler - accounts for these effects in a psychologically plausible manner by assuming that people construct their causal representations using the Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm constrained to only a small number of samples (e.g., < 20). Because it assumes that Markov violations are built into people's causal representations, the causal sampler accounts for the fact that those violations manifest themselves in multiple tasks (both causal reasoning and learning).

This is achieved by augmenting some novel and some existing evolutionary signaling game models with existing techniques in machine learning and cognitive science. The result is a ``grounded'' signaling game in which agents extract relevant information from their environment via a cognitive processing mechanism, then learn to communicate that information with each other. The choice of cognitive processing mechanism is left as a free parameter, allowing the model to be tailored to a wide variety of problems. We present results from simulations using both a Bayesian perception model and a neural network based perception model, which demonstrate how perception can ``pre-process'' environmental data in a way that is well suited for communication. Lastly, we discuss how the model can be extended to study other roles that perception may play in language learning.",>Isaac Davis,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0366/index.html

They then generated responses to an ambiguous letter-string analogy problem.

Participants rated the attractiveness of famous female faces presented in a sequence of three and in isolation. We found that people do integrate information about attractiveness over time, but that temporal context has the opposite effect of static context. People perceived faces as less attractive in a series than in isolation. We also varied the attractiveness of surrounding faces in order to examine how the serial position of contextual information might figure into people’s judgments.

In this cross-sectional study of 86 5- to 7-year-old children we measured overt, partially covert, inner, and strategic speech on four cognitive tasks, along with task performance and child talkativeness. We did not find consistent evidence that self-directed speech changes with age; however, we did find consistent associations between self-directed speech and talkativeness. Partially covert and strategic speech predicted performance on one task, and inner speech was implicated on another. Self-directed speech tended to correlate across tasks, and these correlations held controlling for talkativeness. Taken together, these findings suggest 5- to 7-year-old children may use different forms of self-directed speech to support cognitive control, and that the form this speech takes depends in part on factors beyond age, such as the cognitive demands of a task and child characteristics like talkativeness.",>Sabine Doebel>Yuko Munakata>Cleo Andersen-Green,>University of Colorado - Boulder>University of Colorado - Boulder>University of Colorado - Boulder,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0372/index.html

In the current study we prompted self-evaluation throughout an intelligence test (Analysis-Synthesis Test – AST) using confidence ratings (CR). AST performance, the extent to which participants incidentally learnt task-relevant rules (learning rules was unnecessary because they were provided), self-efficacy, and goals, were assessed. The results indicated an effect of performing CR on both performance and rule learning, but the effect depended on self-efficacy. Compared to matched controls (n=45), participants who performed CR (n=41) and had high self-efficacy performed better on the AST but learnt fewer rules. Performing CR had no effect on participants low in self-efficacy. This suggests that self- evaluation interacts with self-efficacy to modify participants’ goals, specifically CR appear to shift individuals high in self-efficacy from a mastery goal to a performance goal.",>Kit Double>Damian Birney,>University of Sydney>University of Sydney,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0373/index.html

However, humans seem unique in the ability to represent relative magnitude (‘more’/‘less’) and similarity (‘same’/‘different’) as abstract relations that take arguments (e.g., greater-than (x,y)). While many models use structured relational representations of magnitude and similarity, little progress has been made on how these representations arise. Models that developuse these representations assume access to computations of similarity and magnitude a priori, either encoded as features or as output of evaluation operators. We detail a mechanism for producing invariant responses to “same”, “different”, “more”, and “less” which can be exploited to compute similarity and magnitude as an evaluation operator. Using DORA (Doumas, Hummel, & Sandhofer, 2008), these invariant responses can serve be used to learn structured relational representations of relative magnitude and similarity from pixel images of simple shapes.",>Alex Doumas>Aaron Hamer>Guillermo Puebla-Ramirez>Andrea Martin,">University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0375/index.html

In Experiment 1 we show that ratings of comprehensibility are highly correlated across simile and metaphor sentences differing only in the presence or absence of “like”. In Experiment 2 we show that comprehensibility ratings for figurative forms predict both early (first pass) and late (second pass) fixation durations for metaphor vehicle, but only late fixation durations for vehicles in similes.

In this endeavor, one of the central requirements is that the input to the model be represented as faithfully and accurately as possible. However, this is often easier said than done. In the study of recognition memory, for instance, words are the environmental input of choice—yet because words vary on many different dimensions, and because the problem of quantifying this variation has long been out of reach, modelers have tended to rely on idealized, randomly generated representations of their experimental stimuli. In this paper, we introduce new resources from large-scale text mining that may improve upon this practice, illustrating a simple method for deriving feature information directly from word pools and lists.",>Melody Dye>Michael Ramscar>Michael Jones,">Indiana University, Bloomington>University of Tübingen>Indiana University, Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0378/index.html
2017,Due process in dual process: A model-recovery analysis of Smith et al. (2014),"Considerable behavioral evidence has been cited in support of the COVIS dual-system model of category learning (Ashby & Valentin, 2016). The validity of the inferences drawn from these data critically depend on the accurate identification of participants' categorization strategies. In the COVIS literature, participants' strategies are identified using a model-based analysis inspired by General Recognition Theory (Maddox, 1999). Here, we examine the accuracy of this analysis in a model-recovery simulation. We find that participants can appear to be using implicit, procedural strategies when their responses where actually generated by explicit rule-based strategies. The implications of this for the COVIS literature are discussed.",>Charlotte Edmunds>Andy Wills>Fraser Milton,">Plymouth University, Plymouth, Devon, United Kingdom>Plymouth University>University of Exeter",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0379/index.html
2017,Experimental Investigation into the Continuous Pattern of the Relationship Between Color Focality and Short-Term Memory Performance for Colors,"Past studies reported that language-specific color focality has substantial influence on the short-term memory (STM) performance of colors of the speakers of the language, which we call the ""focality effect."" This study attempts to clarify the continuous pattern of this effect, that is, the manner in which correct recognition possibilities and misrecognition error distances of colors, which are two aspects of the STM performance for colors, change in a gradual fashion along the continuum of color focality. Our experiment, which tests the Japanese language, finds that a U-shaped relationship exists between the focality and the possibility of correct recognition, and that the misrecognition error distance increases as the focality decreases. We speculate that the subjects' frequent and conscious employment of the memorization strategy of coding colors using linguistic categories is one important cause of the detected effect patterns.",>Siyuan Fang>Tatsunori Matsui,">Waseda University, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan>Waseda University, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0380/index.html
2017,Deconstructing Social Interaction: The Complimentary Roles of Behaviour Alignment and Partner Feedback to the Creation of Shared Symbols,"This paper experimentally tests the contribution of two distinct aspects of social interaction to the creation of shared symbols: behaviour alignment and concurrent partner feedback. Pairs of participants (N= 120, or 60 pairs) completed an experimental-semiotic game, similar to Pictionary, in which they tried to communicate a range of recurring meanings to a partner by drawing on a shared whiteboard (without speaking or using numbers of letters in their drawings). The opportunity for sign alignment and/or concurrent partner feedback was manipulated in a full factorial design. Each process made a distinct contribution to the evolution of shared symbols: sign alignment directly influenced communication success, and concurrent partner feedback drove sign simplification and symbolization. These complimentary processes led to the interactive evolution of effective and efficient human communication systems.",>Nicolas Fay>Bradley Walker>Nik Swoboda,>University of Western Australia>University of Western Australia>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0381/index.html

Our proposal is based on Mayor and Plunkett (2010)'s neurocomputational model of the taxonomic constraint and overcomes one of its limitations, namely the fact that it considers artificially built, simplified stimuli. In fact, while in the original model the visual stimuli are random, sparse dot patterns, in our proposed solution they are photographic images from the ImageNet database. In our model the represented objects in the image can be of different size, color, location in the picture, point of view, etc..

This meta-analysis included 37 studies with 2,256 children, reflecting 104 effect sizes, investigating how the number of target words, tokens, story repetitions, reading styles and related factors moderate children’s word comprehension. Dialogic reading styles, tokens, the number of words tested and story repetition all moderated word learning effects. Children’s age, who read, number of target words and time between story and test were not moderators.

Children learned significantly fewer words when they had to find the referent within two illustrations presented at the same time. In Experiment 2 a gesture was added to guide children’s attention to the correct page in the two illustrations condition.

To help understand the underlying mechanisms, we present the first robotic model learning both speech and tool use from scratch. It focuses on the role of one important form of body babbling where exploration is directed towards self-generated goals in free play, combined with imitation learning of a contingent caregiver. We show that the mechanisms in this model allow a learner to progressively discover how to grab objects with the hand, how to use objects as tools to reach further objects, how to produce vocal sounds, and how to leverage these vocal sounds to use a caregiver as a social tool to retrieve objects. This model predicts that the grounded exploration of objects in a social interaction scenario should accelerate infant vocal learning of accurate sounds for these objects' names.",>Sébastien Forestier>Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,">Université de Bordeaux and Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, France>Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest and Ensta-ParisTech, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0386/index.html
2017,What counts as math? Relating conceptions of math with anxiety about math,"What do people think of when they think of ""math?"" We propose that individuals may have very different working definitions of the category of math, and that those with broader math conceptions may have less math anxiety. In Study 1, we introduce a method for indexing the ""breadth"" of individuals' math conceptions, and show that there is an inverse relation between conception breadth and math anxiety. These results suggest that math anxiety is related both to how expansive individuals perceive math to be, and how skillful they feel at the activities they think it could involve. Study 2 attempts an intervention on middle school students' conceptions of math. We find the same inverse relationship between students' math conception breadth and anxiety as found in adults. We discuss ongoing work that further explores qualitative variation in math conceptions, and the lessons this may hold for intervening on math anxiety.",>Ruthe Foushee>Rachel Jansen>Mahesh Srinivasan,">University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0387/index.html
2017,After braking comes hasting: reversed effects of indirect associations in 2nd and 4th graders,"The Associative Read-Out Model (AROM) suggests that associations between words can be defined by the log likelihood that they occur together more often in sentences than predicted by their single-word frequency. Moreover, semantic relations can be defined by associative spreading across many common associates. Here, we addressed developmental effects of associative and semantic priming. Thus, we manipulated sentence-co-occurrence-based direct (syntagmatic) and common (paradigmatic) associations between prime and target words in 2nd and 4th graders. Syntagmatic associations decreased response times and error rates in both, 2nd and 4th graders. Paradigmatic associations increased errors rates in 2nd graders, whereas they decreased errors rates in 4th graders. These results suggest that 2nd graders profit from syntagmatic, i.e. contiguity-based associations, while a benefit from paradigmatic-semantic relationship probably develops from generalizing across many of these simple associations.",>Nicole Franke>André Rölke>Ralph R.

2017,TRACX2: a RAAM-like autoencoder modeling graded chunking in infant visual-sequence learning,"Even newborn infants are able to extract structure from a stream of sensory inputs and yet, how this is achieved remains largely a mystery. We present a connectionist autoencoder model, TRACX2, that learns to extract sequence structure by gradually constructing chunks, storing these chunks in a distributed manner across its synaptic weights, and recognizing these chunks when they re-occur in the input stream. Chunks are graded rather than all-or-none in nature and during learning their component parts become ever more tightly bound together. TRACX2 successfully models data from four experiments from the infant visual statistical-learning literature, including tasks involving low-salience embedded chunk items, part-sequences, and illusory items. The model captures performance differences across ages by tuning a single learning rate parameter. These results suggest that infant statistical learning is underpinned by the same domain general learning mechanism that operates in auditory statistical learning and, potentially, in adult artificial grammar learning.",>Robert M.

2017,On an effective and efficient method for exploiting “wisdom of crowds in one mind”,"Previous studies have shown that one can exploit “wisdom of crowds” by oneself. This is achieved by aggregating multiple “quasi-independent” estimates from the same person. However, previous methods were not necessarily easy to utilize. Therefore, we propose an efficient method based on perspective-taking. The procedure is as follows: First, one makes her/his own estimation. Second, one estimates again based on a different perspective (“general public”). Then these two estimations were averaged. Two experiments revealed that our method effectively induced the wisdom of crowds by oneself. More importantly, participants in our method made estimations more quickly than those in a previously proposed method, suggesting that our method required a relatively diminished cognitive load for participants. Further investigation suggested that our method was immune to adverse effects of confidence. Therefore, the present findings show that our method could be effective and efficient method for inducing the wisdom of crowds in one mind.",>Itsuki Fujisaki>Hidehito Honda>Kazuhiro Ueda,">Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo>Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo>Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0391/index.html

The experimental results showed that the top-down processing driven by impressions temporarily formed in specific contexts affected both the extraction of information and the following decision phase whereas top-down processing driven by attitude formed over a long time based on social norms affected only the decision phase.

2017,"Measures and mechanisms of common ground: backchannels, conversational repair, and interactive alignment in free and task-oriented social interactions","A crucial aspect of everyday conversational interactions is our ability to establish and maintain common ground. Understanding the relevant mechanisms involved in such social coordination remains an important challenge for cognitive science. While common ground is often discussed in very general terms, different contexts of interaction are likely to afford different coordination mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the presence and relation of three mechanisms of social coordination – backchannels, interactive alignment and conversational repair – across free and task-oriented conversations. We find significant differences: task-oriented conversations involve higher presence of repair – restricted offers in particular – and backchannel, as well as a reduced level of lexical and syntactic alignment. We find that restricted repair is associated with lexical alignment and open repair with backchannels. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly assess several mechanisms at once and to investigate diverse social activities to understand their role and relations.",>Riccardo Fusaroli>Kristian Tylén>Katrine Garly>Jakob Steensig>Morten Christiansen>Mark Dingemanse,">Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Aarhus University>Cornell University>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0393/index.html

Here, we test whether they dynamically estimate how long it takes to (i) plan and (ii) articulate the words they intend to produce as a means of achieving such coordination. German speakers named two pictures without pausing, while their eye-movements were recorded. In line with previous reports, after their gaze left the first picture, speakers took longer to start speaking (i.e., the gaze-speech lag was longer) when the name of the first picture was shorter. But while gaze-speech lags were also longer when the second picture was harder to name, the two effects did not interact.

2017,Automated Generation of Cognitive Ontology via Web Text-Mining,"A key goal of cognitive science is to understand and map the relationship between cognitive processes. Previous works have manually curated cognitive terms and relations, effectively creating an ontology, but do they reflect how cognitive scientists study cognition in practice? In addition, cognitive science should provide theories that inform experimentalists in neuroscience studying implementations of cognition in the brain. But do neuroscientists and cognitive scientists study the same things? We set out to answer these questions in a data-driven way by text-mining and automated clustering to build a cognitive ontology from existing literature. We find automatically generated relationships to be missing in existing ontologies, and that cognitive science does not always inform neuroscience. Thus, our work serves as an efficient hypothesis-generating mechanism, inferring relationships between cognitive processes that can be manually refined by experts. Furthermore, our results highlight the gap between theories of cognition and the study of their implementation.",>Richard Gao>Thomas Donoghue>Bradley Voytek,">Department of Cognitive Science, UC San Diego>Department of Cognitive Science, UC San Diego>Department of Cognitive Science & Neurosciences Graduate Program, UC San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0395/index.html
2017,"“If It Matters, I Can Explain It”: Social Desirability of Knowledge Increases the Illusion of Explanatory Depth","This paper explores whether social desirability affects the illusion of explanatory depth (IEOD) by comparing the magnitude of this illusion in topics with different levels of social desirability within several domains. Prior literature shows that social expectations about how much a person should know about a certain topic affect the magnitude of the IOED. Previous research shows also that social desirability has an effect on a similar illusion related to argumentation. In order to do so, 184 participants were assigned randomly to three knowledge domains (history, economics, and devices) and in each domain they rated their understanding of a high-desirability and a low-desirability topic following a standard IOED procedure. Results show that social desirability has an effect on the IOED magnitude and that overestimation of understanding varies among domains. Particularly, participants tend to overestimate their understanding of high desirability topics. This effect was stronger in the historical domain.",>Christian Gaviria>Javier Alejandro Corredor>Zadkiel Zuluaga-Rendón,">Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Bogota, D.C., Colombia>Universidad Nacional de Colombia>Universidad Nacional de Colombia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0396/index.html

When, for instance, law to property conflicts with law to information, can one of these rights be “defeated” by the other? We embedded conflicting fundamental rights in inference tasks (Experiment 1) and in elaborated vignettes (Experiment 2). Results show that people decide between two conflicting fundamental rights in a rational way. Case by case, participants protected that fundamental right whose violation evoked the highest moral outrage (Experiment 1) or whose violation was considered to be more serious (Experiment 2).

These goals can include pragmatic criteria such as correctness, informativeness, and brevity (i.e., Gricean conversational maxims) or social factors such as politeness. However, there currently does not exist a general algorithmic method to explicitly modulate language generated by artificial agents based on an arbitrary number of pragmatic and social criteria. We propose a novel method to accomplish this task, in which rankings of candidate utterances by different prag- matic or social criteria are fused by use of a voting algorithm.

We present an inductive account of zoonosis risk perception, suggesting it is influenced by beliefs about the range of animals that are able to transmit diseases to each other. In Study 1, we find that participants who endorse higher likelihoods of cross-species disease transmission have stronger intention to report animal bites. In Study 2, adapting real world descriptions of Ebola virus from the WHO and CDC, we find that communications conveying a broader range of animals as susceptible to a disease increase intentions to report animal bites and decrease perceived safety of wild game meat.

Therefore, we conducted an experiment (N = 105 university students) to investigate judgment bias as a function of reading skill and text difficulty in terms of text cohesion. Results showed that the easy text produced underestimation of comprehension, whereas the hard text led to overestimation. Furthermore, readers with higher reading skills were less prone to overestimate their comprehension of a hard text than less skilled readers. However, we also found that more skilled readers showed lower sensitivity in discriminating between correct and incorrect answers than less skilled readers. Overall, our results do not support the idea that high-performing readers consistently underestimate their text comprehension.

We represent each component and their synthesis as a map, associating a level of attentional bias to locations in space. The maps and their interaction are modeled using an artificial intelligence approach based on constraints. We describe the behavioral task we have designed to measure the attentional bias and discuss the results. We then test different hypotheses on the shape and interaction modalities of the maps in terms of how well they fit our behavioral data. The findings showed that combining top-down and bottom-up spatial attention gradients that differ in their spatial properties produced the best fit to behavioral data, and suggested several novel mechanisms for future testing.",>Edward Golob>K.

We discuss findings suggesting the motor system takes on multiple roles that vary with context and the brain networks involved. Using single-pulse TMS, we measured the MEPs of the FDI muscle in primary motor cortex as participants viewed words that were either typed or handwritten. We observed consistent facilitation of corticospinal excitability during reading of handwritten text. Although we observed faciliatation during the presentation of typed text, this effect decreased with repetitive presentations of stimuli. We suggest the the facilitation during presentation of typed words is a case of action simulation, and that the diminishing facilitation in the case of typed stimuli is representative of sensory prediction by the motor system.

2017,Pragmatic aspects of spatial language acquisition and use across languages,"Across languages, locative back is produced earlier and more frequently than locative front. This asymmetry has been attributed either to a conceptual/semantic asymmetry in the early meanings of these locatives (with back being more basic than front; conceptual immaturity account) or to the fact that Back configurations are inherently more ‘noteworthy’ than Front configurations (pragmatic account). Here, we tested the two accounts. In Study 1, children and adult speakers of English and Greek described Front/Back motion events. In Study 2, adult speakers of 10 additional languages described the same events. Despite cross-linguistic differences, speakers of all age and language groups typically used more Back than Front adpositions; furthermore, they often encoded Back information in occlusion verbs (e.g. hide) but no such verbs were available for Front. Thus, the front/back asymmetry is not due to children’s conceptual immaturity but should be linked to pragmatic factors that also shape adult production cross-linguistically.",>Myrto Grigoroglou>Megan Johanson>Anna Papafragou,>University of Delaware>University of Delaware>University of Delaware,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0407/index.html

Moreover, the information acquisition strategies were consistent with prospect theory, in which participants will weigh information pieces differently and seek more or less information given different manipulations in scenario probability and consequences.

2017,Solving additive word problems: Intuitive strategies make the difference,"Young children use informal strategies to solve arithmetic word problems. The Situation Strategy First (SSF) framework claims that these strategies prevail even after instruction. The present study was conducted with second grade students in order to investigate the persistence of intuitive, situation-based strategies, on word problems that do not involve dynamic temporal changes. This is challenging for the SSF framework, since the lack of this dimension might bypass intuitive strategies. The results revealed that intuitive strategies persist, are valid for these types of problems, and impact the problems' difficulty. Indeed problems that require the application of arithmetic principles remain hard, even though they have been practiced at school. These findings provide complementary evidence to how mental calculation strategies articulate with arithmetic word problem solving and call for the extension of the SSF framework.",>Katarina Gvozdic>Emmanuel Sander,">Université Paris 8, France>Université Paris 8, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0410/index.html
2017,Age differences in language comprehension during driving: Recovery from prediction errors is more effortful for older adults,"Prior research yielded conflicting findings regarding whether older adults show a greater processing cost than younger adults when encountering unpredicted semantic material during language processing. Here, we investigated whether age-related differences in recovery from prediction error are influenced by increased demands on working memory. We used a dual task design: a primary sentence comprehension task in which semantic predictions were fulfilled or violated, and a concurrent driving task, thought to limit working memory resources in resolving prediction errors. In the dual task, older participants showed an increase in comprehension accuracy for sentences with semantic violations, while demonstrating a decrease in driving accuracy. Thus, when working memory resources were limited, older adults focused exclusively on the language task and neglected the driving task. This could be related to an age-related increase in generating semantic predictions, or to a general inability among older adults to divide attention between two cognitively demanding tasks.",>Katja Häuser>Vera Demberg>Jutta Kray,>Collaborative Research Center Information Density and Linguistic Encoding; Saarland University>Collaborative Research Center Information Density and Linguistic Encoding; Saarland University>Collaborative Research Center Information Density and Linguistic Encoding; Saarland University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0411/index.html
2017,Asymmetric detection of changes in volatility: Implications for risk perception,"Variance of the outcomes associated with an option often provides a measure of the riskiness of that option. Hence, it is important that organisms are able to detect any sudden changes in outcome variance. In Experiment 1, we presented people with graphs of share price time series or water level time series. In half the graphs, variance (financial or flooding risk) changed at some point. People were better at detecting increases than decreases in risk - maybe because it is more important to detect increases in danger than decreases in it. However, in Experiment 2, people were still better at detecting increases than decreases in variance even when those changes did not reflect altered levels of risk. Our findings may reflect the fact that the actual change in variance exceeds the change needed to identify a regime change in variance by a larger amount for upward than for downward changes.",>Nigel Harvey>Matt Twyman>Maarten Speekenbrink,>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0412/index.html
2017,Compound effects of expectations and actual behaviors in human-agent interaction: Experimental investigation using the Ultimatum Game,"This study investigated how the expectations of others (i.e., top-down processes) and actual perceived behavior (i.e., bottom-up processes) influence negotiations during human-agent interactions. Participants took part in several sessions of the ultimatum game; we investigated the bargaining strategies directed toward the computer agent. To investigate the influence of top-down and bottom-up processes on performance, we designed an experiment wherein (1) participants expected their partners were humans or agents, and (2) agents used different types of algorithmic behavior. Results revealed that irrational decisions, which are characteristic of human-human interactions, emerged when participants believed their opponents were human and when opponent behaviors were ambiguous. Further, we found participants adopted different bargaining strategies according to their expectations and the agent's specific algorithmic behavior. We discuss interplay of the two types of cognitive processing in human-agent interaction.",>Yugo Hayashi>Ryo Okada,>Ritsumeikan University>Ritsumeikan University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0413/index.html
2017,The role of presentation order and orientation on information search and evaluations: An eye-tracking study,"Previous research conducted by Bergus et al. (2002) identified that treatment evaluations are more negative when risks are presented last. Extending discussion of this order effect, the current study investigates this effect in tabular style displays, manipulating both order and orientation; and using eye-tracking methodology, explores the effect of these variables on the information search process. Analysis from eye-tracking data revealed a tendency to read information sets sequentially (i.e. read all risk information before transitions to the other set), which is stronger for the vertical orientation where switching between information sets is less common. Further, while balanced search was observed when benefits presented first, when presented with the risks first, search becomes more risk-heavy. Eye-tracking measures did not strongly predict treatment evaluations, although, when holding other variables constant, time proportion spent on benefits positively predicted treatment evaluations.",>Claire Heard>Tim Rakow>Tom Foulsham,">King's College London, London, United Kingdom>King's College London, London, United Kingdom>University of Essex",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0414/index.html
2017,Risk and Rationality in Decisions to Commit Crime,"Criminal behavior and related disorders have been associated with abnormal neural activity when experiencing or anticipating risks and rewards, as well as when exercising inhibition. However, behavioral and neural substrates of risk preferences and criminality have received scant attention when unconfounded with experience, anticipation, and inhibition. We test predictions of fuzzy-trace theory (FTT) in two experiments using a risky-choice framing task. Behavioral results show that individuals with a greater history of criminal behavior are less likely to engage in simple meaning-based processing and are less confident when doing so. These findings are supported by fMRI results showing a greater history of criminal behavior is associated with increased activation in regions associated with cognitive control when engaging in simple meaning-based processing. These results provide insight into the cognitive processes and brain mechanisms that are associated with criminal behavior.",>Rebecca Helm>Valerie Reyna>Renee Williamson>Allison Franz,>Cornell University>Cornell University>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0415/index.html
2017,Planning in Action: Interactivity Improves Planning Performance,"Planning is an everyday activity that is extended in time and space and relies on an array of executive functions including self-control. We investigated the effects of interactivity and self-control on planning. Half of the participants first completed a video-viewing task requiring self-control of visual attention, whereas the other half completed the same task without the self-control constraint. Next half of the participants manipulated cards to complete their plan (high-interactivity condition); for the other half, plans were made with their hands down (low-interactivity condition). Planning performance was significantly better in the high- than in the low-interactivity conditions; however, the self-control manipulation had no impact on planning performance. An exploration of individual differences revealed that long-term planning ability and non-planning impulsiveness moderated the impact of interactivity on planning. These findings suggest that interactivity augments working memory resources and planning performance, underscoring the importance of an interactive perspective on planning research.",>Emma Henderson>Gaelle Vallee-Tourangeau>Frederic Vallee-Tourangeau,>Kingston University>Kingston University>Kingston University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0416/index.html
2017,Head and Heart Metaphors for Moral Decision Making: Conceptual or Communicative?,"When faced with a moral dilemma, following your head versus your heart can result in very different decisions. Earlier work has argued that people who “self-locate” in the head tend to make more rational and less emotional decisions to moral dilemmas than those who “self-locate” in the heart. We replicate this finding, suggest an alternative interpretation of the result, and then extend it with a novel experiment. In a metaphor framing task, we manipulated the salience of the head/heart metaphors—by using them (a) in a single sentence, (b) a more elaborate paragraph, or (c) by emphasizing one in contrast to the other. We found that people who received the head metaphor made more rational decisions than those who received the heart metaphor, but only in the high salience condition that contrasted the two metaphors. This finding illustrates the communicative value of metaphor, which can be enhanced through comparison.",>Rose K. Hendricks>Paul H.

2017,When metaphors in the mind become metaphors in the mouth: Documenting the emergence of a new system of linguistic metaphors for time,"Languages exhibit striking semantic diversity, but different languages often share core metaphors. Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) claims that universal human experiences give rise to conceptual representations that are then expressed in language. But languages change slowly, making it difficult to observe implicit conceptualization affecting linguistic convention in real time. Here, we describe a shared conceptualization previously absent from speech that has now become conventionalized in linguistic metaphors. In two studies, we document how members of the US military talk about time using conventionalized lateral metaphors (e.g., ‘push the meeting right’ to mean ‘move the meeting later’). We show that military members, unlike civilians, consider such sentences to be acceptable—sometimes even more acceptable than more standard phrases. Moreover, military personnel seem unaware that these lateral metaphors are specific to their linguistic sub-community. Our findings suggest that implicit mental representations can become conventionalized metaphors in language.",>Rose Hendricks>Tyler Marghetis>Benjamin Bergen,">University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA>Indiana University, Bloomington>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0418/index.html

In this experiment, we compared students’ learning from discussions via a dialog game tool to their learning via a standard freechat application. Students discussed topic questions with a learning partner. They then individually completed a multiple choice test, for assessing knowledge-gain, and a short-answer test, to assess readiness for knowledge-building. Results suggest that dialog games applications lead to increased readiness for knowledge-building, in the form of integrating distinct pieces of learned knowledge, than freechat applications. Follow-up analyses suggest that the degree of concept overlap between students' dialog messages and topic keywords, as measured by a ""semantic fingerprint"" system, is a potentially useful metric for predicting students' knowledge building.

2017,Leveraging mutual exclusivity for faster cross-situational word learning: A theoretical analysis,"Past mechanistic accounts of children’s word learning claim that a simple type of cross-situational learning is powerful enough to match observed rates of learning, even in quite ambiguous situations. However, a limitation in some of these analyses is their reliance on an unrealistic assumption that the learner only hears a word in situations containing the intended referent. This study analyzed a more general type of cross-situational learning based on the relative frequency of word-object pairs, and found it to be slower than the simple mechanism analyzed in prior work. We then analytically explored whether relative-frequency learning can be improved by incorporating the mutual exclusivity (ME) principle—an assumption that words map to objects 1-to-1. Our analyses show that with a certain type of correlation in word-to-word relationship, ME makes relative frequency learning as efficient as fast-mapping, which can learn a word in one exposure.",>Shohei Hidaka>Takuma Torii>George Kachergis,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Radboud University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0420/index.html

This study examined the susceptibility of perceptions of PM to changes in the streakiness of otherwise equivalent series. Fifty-five male participants (31 basketballers and 24 control) completed a ‘hot-cognition’ experiment where they rated individual and team momentum and assessed the likelihood of a future shot’s success after watching sequences of basketball shots. The experimental manipulation of the order of shots strongly affected participants’ ratings of momentum and, less strongly, the probability they assigned to the future shot (i.e. the hot hand effect). Basketballers showed stronger reactions to manipulations of order than the controls, which could be attributed to greater investment in the task. The results demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between PM and the hot hand and also provide a valuable extension of prior work showing such effects into more realistic scenarios.",>Thomas Hilbig>Matthew Welsh>Paul Delfabbro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0421/index.html
2017,Translating a Reinforcement Learning Task into a Computational Psychiatry Assay: Challenges and Strategies,"Computational psychiatry applies advances from computational neuroscience to psychiatric disorders. A core aim is to develop tasks and modeling approaches that can advance clinical science. Special interest has centered on reinforcement learning (RL) tasks and models. However, laboratory tasks in general often have psychometric weaknesses and RL tasks pose special challenges. These challenges must be addressed if computational psychiatry is to capitalize on its promise of developing sensitive, replicable assays of cognitive function. Few resources identify these challenges and discuss strategies to mitigate them. Here, we first overview general psychometric challenges associated with laboratory tasks, as these may be unfamiliar to cognitive scientists. Next, we illustrate how these challenges interact with issues specific to RL tasks, in the context of presenting a case example of preparing an RL task for computational psychiatry. Throughout, we highlight how considering measurement issues prior to a clinical science study can inform study design.",>Peter Hitchcock>Yael Niv>Angela Radulescu>Chris Sims,>Drexel University>Princeton University>Princeton University>Drexel University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0422/index.html
2017,The Meanings of Morality: Investigating the psychometric properties of distributed representations of latent moral concepts,"People’s beliefs about what is morally right and wrong vary widely between individuals, contexts, and cultures; however it is thought that they are governed by core latent constructs. While there is evidence that these constructs are reflected in natural language, this requires further testing. We demonstrate that the structure of moral values in natural discourse can be modeled by applying factor analyses to distributed representations of morally relevant terms learned by a neural network. We first demonstrate that robust latent constructs can be estimated from the covariance of distributed representations of construct exemplars. We then test whether the factor structure proposed by Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) is reflected in natural language. Finally, we conduct a bottom-up investigation of the structure of moral values in natural language using free-responses reported by participants. Ultimately, we find evidence that the representation of moral values in natural language partially corresponds to MFT.",>Joe Hoover>Katie Horton>Morteza Dehghani,">University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States>University of Southern California>University of Southern California",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0423/index.html
2017,Probability judgement from samples: accurate estimates and the conjunction fallacy,"This paper investigates a fundamental conflict in the literature on people's probability estimation. Research on 'perception' of probability shows that people are accurate in their estimates of probability of various simple events from samples. Equally, however, a large body of research shows that people's probability estimates are fundamentally biased, and subject to reliable and striking fallacies in reasoning. We investigate this conflict in an experiment that examines the occurrence of the conjunction fallacy in a probability perception task where people are asked to estimate the probability of simple and conjunctive events in a presented set of items. We find that people's probability estimates are accurate, especially for simple events, just as seen in previous studies. People's estimates also show high rates of occurrence of the conjunction fallacy. We show how this apparently contradictory result is consistent with a recent model of probability estimation, the ‘probability theory plus noise' model.",>Rita Howe>Fintan Costello,>University College Dublin>University College Dublin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0424/index.html

It is well-known that patients with schizophrenia have problems with language and social cognitive skills, yet little research has investigated how these impact interaction. We report a study on the disfluency behaviours of patients with schizophrenia and their interlocutors who were unaware of the patient's diagnosis, compared to healthy control groups. Results show that patients use fewer self-repairs than either their partners or controls and fewer filled pauses ('er', 'um') than controls. Furthermore, the presence of the patient also affects patients' partners, who use fewer filled pauses than controls and more unfilled pauses than both patients and controls. This suggests that smooth coordination of turns is problematic in patients' dialogues.",>Christine Howes>Mary Lavelle>Patrick Healey>Julian Hough>Rose McCabe,>University of Gothenburg>King's College London>Queen Mary University of London>Bielefeld University>Exeter University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0425/index.html
2017,Moral Action Changes Mind Perception for Human and Artificial Moral Agents,"Mind perception is studied for three different agents: a human, an artificial human, and a humanoid robot. The artificially created agents are presented as being undistinguishable from a human. Each agent is rated on 15 mental capacities. Three mind perception dimensions are identified - Experience, Agency, and Cognition. The artificial agents are rated higher on the Cognition dimensions than on the other two dimensions. The humanoid robot is rated lower than the human on the Experience dimension. These results show that people ascribe to artificial agents some mental capacities more than others. In a second experiment, the effect of agent’s moral action on mind perception is explored. It is found that when the artificial agents have undertaken a moral action, they are perceived to be similar to the human agent. More interestingly, the presentation of the moral action leads to a restructuring of the dimensions of mind perception.",>Evgeniya Hristova>Maurice Grinberg,">New Bulgarian University>New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Bulgaria",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0426/index.html

2017,A New Model of Statistical Learning: Trajectories Through Perceptual Similarity Space,"Existing models of statistical learning involve computation of conditional probabilities over discrete, categorical items in a sequence. We propose an alternative view that learning occurs through a process of tracking changes along physical dimensions from one stimulus to the next within a “perceptual similarity space.” To test this alternative, we examined a situation where it is difficult to categorize stimuli, and where the two assumptions lead to different predictions. We conducted two experiments in which participants passively listened to a familiarization sequence of frequency-modulated tones and were then asked to make familiarity judgments on a series of test bigrams. Results were broadly consistent with a conceptualization of learning as tracking trajectories through perceptual similarity space. We also trained a neural network that codes stimuli as values along two continuous dimensions to predict the next stimulus given the current stimulus, and show that it captured key features of the human data.",>Elizabeth A.

2017,The role of prior knowledge and expertise on choice of referring expression,"Referential success depends on choice of referring expression. The choice of referring expression will depend on various factors, including speaker and addressee knowledge. A shared-learning paradigm was used in which partners learned names of objects together and separately before a referential task. Items differed on commonality, which were independently rated as common or rare. Speakers were less likely to use names versus other forms when items were rare than common (p<0.001) and less likely to use names when items were new than learned together (p<0.001). Speakers were also more likely to use a name when the addressee was deemed more knowledgeable (p<0.01). We take this to show speakers choose to use a name based on the likelihood that their interlocutor will know the name. Factors affecting the likelihood include prior knowledge of what a typical addressee will know and shared experience, which includes dynamically updated inferences about the interlocutor’s expertise.",>Alyssa Ibarra>Jeffery Runner>Michael Tanenhaus,">University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA>University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA>University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0429/index.html
2017,Beyond Almost-Sure Termination,"The aim of this paper is to argue that models in cognitive science based on probabilistic computation should not be restricted to those procedures that almost surely (with probability 1) terminate. There are several reasons to consider non-terminating procedures as candidate components of cognitive models. One theoretical reason is that there is a perfect correspondence between the enumerable semi-measures and all probabilistic programs, as we demonstrate here (generalizing a better-known fact about computable measures and almost-surely halting programs). One practical reason is that the line between almost sure termination and non-termination is elusive, as well as arbitrary. We argue that this matters not only for theorists, but also potentially for a learner faced with the task of inducing programs from experience.",>Thomas Icard,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0430/index.html
2017,The Influence of Speaker's Gaze on Sentence Comprehension: An ERP Investigation,"Behavioral studies demonstrate the influence of speaker gaze in visually-situated spoken language comprehension. We present an ERP experiment examining the influence of speaker's gaze congruency on listeners' comprehension of referential expressions related to a shared visual scene. We demonstrate that listeners exploit speakers' gaze toward objects in order to form sentence continuation expectations: Compared to a congruent gaze condition, we observe an increased N400 when (a) the lack of gaze (neutral) does not allow for upcoming noun prediction, and (b) when the noun violates gaze-driven expectations (incongruent). The later also results in a late (sustained) positivity, reflecting the need to update the assumed situation model. We take the combination of the N400 and late positivity as evidence that speaker gaze influences both lexical retrieval and integration processes, respectively (Brouwer et al., in press). Moreover, speaker gaze is interpreted as reflecting referential intentions (Staudte & Crocker, 2011).",>Torsten Jachmann>Heiner Drenhaus>Maria Staudte>Matthew Crocker,">Department of Language Science and Technology, Saarland University, Germany>Department of Language Science and Technology, Saarland University, Germany>Department of Language Science and Technology, Saarland University, Germany>Department of Language Science and Technology, Saarland University, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0431/index.html

Specifically, dyslexics' implicit memory decays faster and consequently only accumulates information over shorter temporal windows. We now ask whether this abnormal dynamic is domain general by measuring its cortical distribution. We measure the dynamics of behavioral context effects and the concurrent neural adaptation during fast acquisition fMRI. We find a similar pattern of fast decay of adaptation across a broad range of cortical areas, though most significant effects are found in auditory cortex. This broad neural distribution suggests that the relevant aspect of implicit statistical inferences is not the nature of stimuli, but their temporal distribution.",>Sagi Jaffe-Dax>Merav Ahissar,>Princeton University>Hebrew University of Jerusalem,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0432/index.html

We asked participants to explicitly report their odds of successfully throwing a beanbag into each hoop from the location they had chosen to stand, and estimates were highly accurate. Nonetheless, participants failed to use estimates of success appropriately to maximize success, suggesting a failure of insight, rather than limited or inaccurate information, can account for suboptimal decisions about standing position.",>Warren James>Alasdair Clarke>Amelia Hunt,">The University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom>The University of Essex, United Kingdom>The University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0434/index.html

Previous studies have found that participants are systematically poor at judging their own performance, though sometimes self-assessment varies based on actual performance. We explored calibration of self-assessment on algebra problems, a domain where people have typically received explicit instruction. In this domain, we found that people do not behave as they do in other domains previously studied: they are generally well-calibrated in judging their algebra performance. This suggests that in the course of learning to solve algebra problems, people have also learned to accurately judge their performance, both absolutely and relative to others.",>Rachel Jansen>Anna Rafferty>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley>Carleton College>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0435/index.html

Moreover, it may be a reflection of a broader individual tendency for epistemic irrationality, which drives also other pseudoscientific and paranormal beliefs. However, the relation between conspiracy belief and reasoning ability (fluid intelligence; Gf) was not sufficiently studied, even though Gf is crucial to how individuals think and reason. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we found the robust link between conspiracy belief and other irrational beliefs. All the irrational beliefs were also substantially related to close-minded cognitive style. However, Gf explained only below 2% of variance in conspiracy belief, even though it significantly predicted other irrational beliefs.

In the present study, previous work was replicated, but accuracy increased in a new condition in which people were asked to catch an actual ball emerging from a tube. That is, in this case there is a discrepancy between how we believe the world works, and how our motor system responds to events in the world.

To address this question, we conducted network analysis on the vocabularies of 2,912 children, with 566 of those being late talkers. Contrary to previously reported findings, the results show that late talkers have well-connected vocabularies as measured by median degree, clustering coefficient, and mean distance, with more well-connected networks in some cases than typical talkers. Further analysis of word order suggests that late talkers may be selecting based on frequency and connectivity of the words in the learning environment, more so than typical talkers. The language processing difficulties in late talkers appear not to be associated with their semantic network properties. In sum, late talkers may initially benefit from using word frequency and word connectivity strategies to build well-connected vocabularies.",>Eva Jimenez>Thomas Hills,">University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom>University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0438/index.html

Focusing on the prepositions in and on, we set out to disentangle spatial language meaning from use by comparing judgments on a series of linguistic tasks designed to tap each aspect of spatial language. We demonstrate that judgments of truth-conditional meaning and patterns of use show different distributional signatures: judgments of meaning give rise to a more uniform distribution than use patterns. We explore another judgment: lexical choice, and propose that choice is a key factor in shaping the distribution of spatial expression use. Our analyses reveal that patterns of choice judgments correlate with the patterns of expression use in spatial descriptions for the same spatial scenes, supporting a model of spatial language that differs from traditional accounts of meaning and categorization.",>Kristen Johannes>Barbara Landau,>WestEd>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0439/index.html
2017,Belief Digitization in Economic Prediction,"Economic choices depend on our predictions of the future. Yet, at times predictions are not based on all relevant information, but instead on the single most likely possibility, which is treated as though certainly the case—that is, digitally. Two sets of studies test whether this digitization bias would occur in higher-stakes economic contexts. When making predictions about the future asset prices, participants ignored conditional probability information given relatively unlikely events and relied entirely on conditional probabilities given the more likely events. This effect was found for both financial aggregates and individual stocks, for binary predictions about the direction and continuous predictions about expected values, and even when the “unlikely” event explicitly had a probability as high as 30%; further, it was not moderated by investing experience. Implications for behavioral finance are discussed.",>Samuel Johnson>Faith Hill,>Yale University>Vassar College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0440/index.html
2017,Measuring Abstract Mindsets through Syntax: Improvements in Automating the Linguistic Category Model,"The Linguistic Category Model (LCM) was developed as a manual coding scheme for quantifying abstract mindsets in human language. Previous attempts to computationally automate the LCM have relied primarily on pre-coded semantic features, which fail to incorporate important contextual information integral to the LCM coding scheme. In this paper, we introduce Syntax-LCM, a novel method for automating LCM coding using syntax and dependency tree features as predictors of construal level. We compare the accuracy of Syntax-LCM to that of two previously used automated methods: LIWC LCM and Brysbaert concreteness ratings. We find support that the Syntax-LCM approximates the hand-coded LCM with higher accuracy compared to both the Brysbaert and the LIWC LCM. We also provide evidence that the syntactic features accounted for by Syntax-LCM mirror the inclusion criteria in the original coding manual and support theoretical relationships between distance and abstract thinking.",>Kate M.

2017,Iconicity in Word Learning: What Can We Learn from Cross-Situational Learning Experiments?,"Iconicity, i.e. resemblance between form and meaning, is a widespread feature of natural language vocabulary (Perniss, Thompson, & Vigliocco, 2010), and has been shown to facilitate vocabulary acquisition (Imai, Kita, Nagumo, & Okada). But what kind of advantage does iconicity actually give? Here we use cross-situational learning (Yu & Smith, 2007), to address the question for sound-shape iconicity (the so-called kiki-bouba effect, Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001). In contrast to Monaghan, Mattock, and Walker (2012), Experiment 1 suggests that the iconicity advantage comes from referential disambiguation rather than more efficient memory encoding. Experiments 2 and 3 replicate this result, and moreover show that the kiki-bouba effect is roughly equally strong for sharp and rounded shapes, a property that classic experiments were unable to confirm, and which has implication for the effect’s mechanism.",>Matthew Jones>Gabriella Vigliocco,>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0442/index.html
2017,Mindfulness and Fear Conditioning,"During mindfulness-based interventions, participants can be invited to bring aversive stimuli to mind while practicing mindfulness in order to help the stimuli become less aversive. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. In this study we explored these by examining the effects of mindfulness practice and stimulus visualization on stimuli associated with electric shocks. Participants were trained on a discrimination between two visual stimuli using a standard electrodermal conditioning procedure, in which one stimulus (CS+) was paired with shock and the other (CS-) was not. They then visualized either the CS+ or CS-, while practicing mindfulness or performing a control activity. Following a brief extinction phase, the impact of these manipulations was assessed during reacquisition. Both mindfulness and visualization of the CS+ led to slower reacquisition of the CS+/shock association, when measured physiologically, and their effects were additive. Moreover, these effects dissociated from participants’ expectancy of shock.",>Fergal Jones>Rossy McLaren>Ipl McLaren,">Canterbury Christ Church University, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, United Kingdom>University of Exeter, Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom>University of Exeter",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0443/index.html

2017,Document Similarity Misjudgment by LSA: Misses vs. False Positives,"Modeling text document similarity is an important yet challenging task. Even the most advanced computational linguistic models often misjudge document similarity relative to humans. Regarding the pattern of misjudgment between models and humans, Lee and colleagues (2005) suggested that the models’ primary failure is occasional underestimation of strong similarity between documents. According to this suggestion, there should be more extreme misses than extreme false positives. We tested this claim by comparing document similarity ratings generated by humans and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Notably, we implemented LSA with 441 unique parameter settings, determined optimal parameters that yielded high correlations with human ratings, and finally identified misses and false positives under the optimal parameter settings. The results showed that, as Lee et al. predicted, large errors were predominantly misses rather than false positives. Potential causes of the misses and false positives are discussed.",>Kyung Hun Jung>Eric Ruthruff>Timothy Goldsmith,>Kennesaw State University>University of New Mexico>University of New Mexico,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0445/index.html
2017,"""The Polar Express"" is Bipolar: Critical Film Reviews Influence Uncanny Valley Phenomenon in Animation Films","Previous research suggests that semi-realistic animation films such as The Polar Express are representative of the uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis, which predicts that highly human-like artificial characters can appear eerie. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which critical film reviews can influence the perceived eeriness of such films. The reviews were adopted from authentic ones and expressed either negative or positive attitudes towards the animation techniques. Audiovisual speech asynchrony, which is known to induce eeriness, was included as an objective manipulation. Our results showed large review tone effects for both implicit and explicit eeriness evaluations. In contrast, speech asynchrony failed to elicit significant effects. These results demonstrate that critical film reviews representing opposite attitudinal poles can elicit consistent changes in the viewers’ evaluations of semi-realistic animations. The present findings cannot, however, be taken as evidence against the UV hypothesis itself in computer-generated characters.",>Jari Kätsyri,">Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Maastricht University, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0446/index.html

It has been argued that the motor system is involved in both processes, but how does it distinguish in this processing between self and other? In this paper, we present a model of self-other distinction within a hierarchical sensorimotor system that is based on principles of perception-action coupling and predictive processing. For this we draw on mechanisms assumed for the integration of cues to generate sense of agency, i.e., the sense that an action is self-generated. We report results from simulations of different social scenarios, showing that the model is able to solve the problem of the dual use of the sensorimotor system.",>Sebastian Kahl>Stefan Kopp,">Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany>Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0447/index.html

Undergraduate college students learned an instantiation of a cyclic group and were then given a test of a novel isomorphic group of the same order followed by a test of a novel non-isomorphic group of a higher order. The results were that both the sentential and the diagrammatic formats led to successful learning and transfer to the novel isomorphic group. However, only learning from the diagrammatic representation produced successful transfer to the non-isomorphic group. These findings suggest that learning a diagrammatic representation of a mathematical concept can have transfer advantages over learning strictly sentential formats.",>Jennifer Kaminski,>Wright State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0448/index.html

The present study investigated the pragmatic competence of 4-year-olds, specifically the ability to incorporate speaker knowledge into the derivation of ad hoc scalar implicatures. Using a simple paradigm inspired by referential communication, we found that 4- year-olds are able to incorporate speaker knowledge into implicature derivation.

2017,A Hebbian account of entrenchment and (over)-extension in language learning,"In production, frequently used words are preferentially extended to new, though related meanings. In comprehension, frequent exposure to a word instead makes the learner confident that all of the word’s legitimate uses have been experienced, resulting in an entrenched form-meaning mapping between the word and its experienced meaning(s). This results in a perception-production dissociation, where the forms speakers are most likely to map onto a novel meaning are precisely the forms that they believe can never be used that way. At first glance, this result challenges the idea of bidirectional form-meaning mappings, assumed by all current approaches to linguistic theory. In this paper, we show that bidirectional form-meaning mappings are not in fact challenged by this production-perception dissociation. We show that the production-perception dissociation is expected even if learners of the lexicon acquire simple symmetrical form-meaning associations through simple Hebbian learning.",>Vsevolod Kapatsinski>Zara Harmon,>University of Oregon>University of Oregon,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0450/index.html

Previous studies with deaf individuals mostly focused on linguistic expressions of motion events, which have several event components. We do not know if similar effects emerge in simple events such as descriptions of spatial configurations of objects. Moreover, previous data mainly come from late adult signers. There is not much known about language development of late signing children soon after learning sign language. We compared simple event descriptions of late signers of Turkish Sign Language (adults, children) to age-matched native signers. Our results indicate that while late signers in both age groups are native-like in frequency of expressing a relational encoding, they lag behind native signers in using morphologically complex linguistic forms compared to other simple forms.

The goal of this paper is to resolve tensions (i) and (ii).

2017,Decoding Virtual Agent’s Emotion and Strategy from Brain Patterns,"Recent advances in technology have paved the way for human-agent interactions to become ubiquitous in our daily lives, and decades worth of research on virtual agents have enhanced these interactions. However, the effect of different types of agents on the human brain is unknown, and the neuroscience of human-agent interactions is rarely studied. In this study, we examine the underlying neural systems involved in processing and responding to different types of negotiating agents. More specifically, we show that different brain patterns are observed for various types of agents. Using fMRI data, we analyzed participants’ brain activity during negotiations with agents who show three different emotional expressions and use two different types of negotiation strategies. We demonstrate that, using Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis, we can reliably decode agents’ emotional expressions based on the activity in the left dorsal anterior insula, and also agents’ strategies based on the activity in the frontal pole.",>Eunkyung Kim>Sarah Gimbel>Aleksandra Litvinova>Jonas Kaplan>Morteza Dehghani,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0457/index.html

Using agents labeled as either “another participant” or a “computer program”, we investigated the differences in people’s behavior and brain activity during the course of a negotiation paradigm. Our results indicate that people perceive human-labeled agents more human-like than computer-labeled agents, and the level of concession in the negotiations is dependent on agent type. We have also found that these differences can be captured in brain activation by showing that different brain patterns are observed in parts of the Theory of Mind neural correlates. We further demonstrate that brain activity can predict whether the negotiation agent was introduced as a competing human player or a computer program. Overall, our study suggests that different labeling of an interaction partner leads to significant impacts on one’s decision making.",>Eunkyung Kim>Jared Gilbert>Charlotte Horowitz>Jonathan Gratch>Jonas Kaplan>Morteza Dehghani,>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Michigan>University of Southern California>University of Southern California>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0458/index.html
2017,What Do We Learn from Dyslexia and Second Language Learners on the Difference Between Long-term Frequency and Short-term Sequence Repetition Effects?,"Dyslexia is a common learning disability, but its core deficit is still under debate. The anchoring deficit hypothesis suggests that dyslexics’ benefit from experimental stimuli statistics is impaired (e.g. Ahissar, 2007). In this study we asked whether dyslexia is also associated with reduced sensitivity to long-term statistics. Spans for lists of syllables were measured, and indeed, dyslexics benefited less than controls from syllabic frequency. However, dyslexics’ benefit from sequence repetition was similar to controls’. In order to dissociate the impact of item familiarity from exposure unrelated factors, native English speakers performed the experiment. They were expected to benefit from repetition, but not from syllabic frequency (in Hebrew). Indeed, that was the case. These data suggest that benefits from long-term distributional statistics are impaired in dyslexia, whereas on-line benefits from sequence repetition are adequate. Moreover, our results suggest different underlying mechanisms for long-term distribution learning and short-term sequence learning.",>Eva Kimel>Itay Lieder>Luba Daikhin>Hilla Jacoby>Atalia Hai Weiss>Merav Ahissar,">The Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem>The Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem>Department of Psychology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem>Department of Psychology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem>Department of Psychology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem>The Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences and Department of Psychology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0459/index.html

In this paper, we present two experiments that undermine this claim, showing that people attribute increased causality to agents who conform to the norm of frequent behaviour. Furthermore, we find that the time point at which a moral norm is introduced does not make a difference to causal attributions, but that the frequency of a norm violation further accentuates its causal rating. Because these findings present a challenge to current norm theories of causation, we argue for an extended counterfactual model of causal attribution.",>Lara Kirfel>David Lagnado,">University College London, London, Greater London, United Kingdom>University College London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0460/index.html

Participants made a final estimation, either by taking the advice fully, partially, or rejecting it totally. They repeated 48 estimations without feedback. The weight of advice index, representing how much each participant weighed a given advice, gradually decreased as the number of trials increased. Interestingly, the gradual reduction of acceptance was not observed in participants with high empathy and low depressive scores; they kept accepting advice even when the effectiveness of advice was unclear.

To answer these questions, we recruited eight chronic post-stroke aphasic patients and 13 cognitively healthy adults, who underwent testing on a range of evaluative tests and four experiments specifically designed for the purposes of this study. The experimental results suggest that post-stroke patients with motor aphasia have impaired inner speech. However, patients’ subjective reports indicate that they use various types of inner speech, despite the observed deficit. Taken together, our data suggest that impairment of certain aspects of inner speech may still allow a degree of use of other aspects of inner speech, emphasizing a need to extend research on inner speech in aphasia to the variety of its forms.",>Vanja Kljajevic>Estibaliz Ugarte Gómez>Cristina López>Yolanda Balboa Bandeira>Agustin Vicente,">University of the Basque Country, Vitoria & IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain>Asociación de traumatismo cráneo-encefálico y daño cerebral adquirido de Álava (ATeCe), Vitoria, Spain>ATeCe, Vitoria, Spain>ATeCe, Vitoria, Spain>University of the Basque Country, Vitoria & IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0462/index.html

However, previous research that has tested this assumption has mainly applied offline measures of visual attention, such as the occurrence of overspecification in speakers’ target descriptions. Therefore, in the current study, we take both online (eye-tracking) and offline (overspecification) measures of attention, to study how perceptual grouping affects scene perception, and reference production. We manipulated three grouping principles: region of space, type similarity, and color similarity. For all three factors, we found effects, either on eye movements (region of space), overspecification (color similarity), or both (type similarity). The results for type similarity provide direct evidence for the close link between scene perception and reference production.",>Ruud Koolen>Yorick Fliervoet,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0464/index.html
2017,Modelling conceptual change as foraging for explanations on an epistemic landscape,"We discuss here conceptual change and the formation of robust learning outcomes from the viewpoint of complex dynamic systems, where students’ conceptions are seen as context dependent and multifaceted structures which depend on the context of their application. According to this view the conceptual patterns (i.e. intuitive conceptions) may be robust in a certain situation but are not formed, at last not as robust ones, in another situation. We use computational modelling in understanding the generic dynamic and emergent features of that phenomenon. The model shows how context dependence, described here through structure of epistemic landscape, leads to formation of context dependent robust states. The sharply defined nature of these states makes learning to appear as a progression of switch from state to another, given appearance of conceptual change as switch form one robust state to another.",>Ismo Koponen>Tommi Kokkonen,">University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland>University of Helsinki, Helsinki",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0465/index.html

On one account, high-functioning adults with ASD struggle to infer others’ mental states. On another account, they lack an ability to integrate those mental states into a coherent understanding of action. We tested these two accounts by making several modifications to the Faux Pas task—a commonly used advanced theory of mind task—including the presentation of explicit mental state information.

Previous approaches rather described similar sequential effects with feedback learning or the misperception of randomness. However, in the selection of job candidates also the accumulation of the moral impact of previous choices might influence subsequent choices. We investigated that question by making two major contributions to the literature. First we developed an experimental paradigm for measuring sequential choices in employee selection and second, we implemented a widely applicable computational model, the Dependent Sequential Sampling Model, for explaining sequential effects in choices. By using this methodological approach, we uncovered sequential effects in employee selection. Participants (N=600) were especially motivated to compensate for morally dubious choices, with some participants showing consistent choice behavior if their previous choices had been morally virtuous. These results support the assumption of asymmetric compensation of morally dubious choices, sometimes referred to as the moral cleansing hypothesis.",>Antonia Krefeld-Schwalb>Benjamin Scheibehenne>Jörg Rieskamp>Nicolas Berkowitsch,">University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland>University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland>University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland>University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0467/index.html
2017,The Influence of Prosody and Case Marking on Thematic Role Assignment in Ambiguous Action Scenes: Adults versus Children,"In two visual word eye tracking studies, we investigated the influence of prosody and case marking on children’s and adults’ thematic role assignment. We assigned an SVO/ OVS-biasing (vs. neutral) prosodic contour to unambiguously case marked German subject-verb-object (SVO) and object-verb-subject (OVS) sentences respectively. Scenes depicted ambiguous action events (e.g., donkey-paints->elephant-paints->cheetah) but case marking and prosody could, in principle, disambiguate. In adults, case marking but not prosody rapidly guided thematic role assignment. Children did not rely on case marking but exploited the biasing prosody to enhance their agent-first interpretation of the sentences. These results suggest that in scenes depicting fully ambiguous role relations, children’s understanding of case marking at the age of five is not yet robust enough to enable thematic role assignment. Prosody did not overwrite the SVO preference, it rather enhanced it.",>Julia Marina Kroeger>Katja Muenster>Pia Knoeferle,>Bielefeld University>Humboldt University Berlin>Humboldt University Berlin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0468/index.html

2017,Thinking and Guessing: Bayesian and Empirical Models of How Humans Search,"Searching natural environments, as for example, when foraging or looking for a landmark, combines reasoning under uncertainty, planning and visual search. Existing paradigms for studying search in humans focus on step-by-step information sampling, without examining advance planning. We propose and evaluate a Bayesian model of how people search in a naturalistic maze-solving task. The model encodes environment exploration as a sequential process of acquiring information modelled by a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which maximises the information gained. We show that the search policy averaged across participants is optimal. Individual solutions, however, are highly variable and can be explained by two heuristics: thinking and guessing. Self-report and inference, a Gaussian Mixture Model over inverse POMDP, consistently assign most subjects to one style or the other. By analysing individual participants' decision times we show that individuals solve partial POMDPs and plan their search a limited number of steps in advance.",>Marta Kryven>Tomer Ullman>William Cowan>Josh Tenenbaum,">University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0470/index.html
2017,The Puzzle of Conditionals with True Clauses: Against the Gricean Account,"Indicative conditionals, that is sentences of the form “If p, then q,” belong to the most puzzling phenomena of language. On the majority of accounts of indicative conditionals, the truth of p and q suffices for “If p, then q” to be true or highly acceptable. Yet, many conditionals with true clauses, even if there is a meaningful connection between them, sound odd. The most common reaction to this phenomenon is to attribute the oddity of conditionals with true clauses to natural language pragmatics. We present an experimental study investigating how the presence or absence of a connection between the clauses affects the assertability of conditionals and conjunction expressing generic and specific kind of content.

2017,Cascading effect of context and competition on novel word learning,"Learning, especially in the case of language acquisition, is not an isolated process; there is ever-present competition between words and objects in the world. Such competition is known to play a critical role in learning. Namely, the amount and variability of competing items during word learning have been shown to change learning trajectories in young children learning new words. However, very little work has examined the interaction of competition amount, competition variability, and task demands in adults. The current study assesses adults’ ability to map new word-referent pairs in varying amounts of competition and competitor variability. In addition, the effect of mapping context on retention was assessed. Results suggest that retention is weak in some cases and importantly, there are cascading effects of competitor variability in mapping on later retention of new words. Results are discussed in light of associative learning mechanisms and the implications of competition for learning.",>Sarah Kucker>Aaron Bagley,>University of Wisconsin Oshkosh>University of Wisconsin Oshkosh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0472/index.html
2017,Geometric Concept Acquisition in a Dueling Deep Q-Network,"Explaining how intelligent systems come to embody knowledge of deductive concepts through inductive learning is a fundamental challenge of both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. We address this challenge by exploring how a deep reinforcement learning agent, occupying a setting similar to those encountered by early-stage mathematical concept learners, comes to represent ideas such as rotation and translation. We first train a Dueling Deep Q-Network on a shape sorting task requiring implicit knowledge of geometric properties, then we query this network with classification and preference selection tasks. We demonstrate that scalar reinforcement provides sufficient signal to learn representations of shape categories. After training, the model shows a preference for more symmetric shapes, which it can sort more quickly than less symmetric shapes, supporting the view symmetry preferences may be acquired from goal-directed experience.",>Alex Kuefler>Mykel J.

2017,Perceived Difficulty of Moral Dilemmas Depends on Their Causal Structure: A Formal Model and Preliminary Results,"We propose causal agency models for representing and reasoning about ethical dilemmas. We find that ethical dilemmas, although they appear similar on the surface, differ in their formal structure. Based on their structural properties, as identified by the causal agency models, we cluster a set of dilemmas in Type 1 and Type 2 dilemmas. We observe that for Type 1 dilemmas but not for Type 2 dilemmas a utilitarian action does not dominate the possibility of refraining from action thereby constituting a conflict. Hence, we hypothesize, based on the model, that Type 1 dilemmas are perceived as more difficult than Type 2 dilemmas by human reasoners. A behavioral study where participants rated the difficulty of dilemmas supports the models' predictions.",>Barbara Kuhnert>Felix Lindner>Martin Bentzen>Marco Ragni,">Albert-Ludwigs Universität, Freiburg, Germany>University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany>Danish Technical University>University of Freiburg",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0474/index.html
2017,Communicative efficiency in language production and learning: Optional plural marking,"Recent work suggests that language production exhibits a bias towards efficient information transmission. Speakers tend to provide more linguistic signal for meaning elements that are difficult to recover while reducing contextually inferrable (more frequent, probable, or expected) elements. This trade-off has been hypothesized to shape grammatical systems over generations, contributing to cross-linguistic patterns. We put this idea to an empirical test using miniature artificial language learning over variable input. Two experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the inferrability of plurality information inversely predicts the likelihood of overt plural marking, as would be expected if learners prefer communicatively efficient systems. The results were obtained even with input frequency counts of the plural marker counteracting the bias, and thus provide strong support for a critical role of inferrability of meaning in language learning, production, as well as in typologically attested variations.",>Chigusa Kurumada>Scott Grimm,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0475/index.html
2017,Behavioral Dynamics and Action Selection in a Joint Action Pick-and-Place Task,"Many common tasks require or are made more efficient by coordinating with others. In this paper we investigate the coordination dynamics of a joint action pick-and-place task in order to identify the behavioral dynamics that underlie the emergence of human coordination. More precisely, we introduce a task dynamics approach for modeling multi-agent interaction in a continuous pick-and-place task where two agents must decide to work together or alone to move an object from one location to another. Our aims in the current paper are to identify and model (1) the relevant affordance dynamics that underlie the selection of the different action modes required by the task and (2) the trajectory dynamics of each actor’s hand movements when moving to grasp, relocate, or pass the object. We demonstrate that the emergence of successful coordination can be characterized in terms of behavioral dynamics models which may have applications for artificial agent design.",>Maurice Lamb>Tamara Lorenz>Stephen Harrison>Rachel Kallen>Ali Minai>Michael Richardson,">University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States>University of Connecticut>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0476/index.html

This phenomenon has been modeled as the result of a Bayesian combination of prior category knowledge with an imprecise memory trace (Huttenlocher, Hedges & Vevea, 2000). Whereas previous work analyzed data aggregated across participants, here we examined individual differences in strategy. Thirty-six participants viewed and reproduced 496 morphed face stimuli that ranged from angry to happy. We found substantial variation in the bias patterns participants produced. Individuals’ estimates were well fit by a model that posited attraction toward three categories, one at the happy end of the range, one at the angry end, and one that captured the entire range of presented stimuli, allowing the weight given to each category to vary by participant.",>David Landy>L.

2017,Simulating performance in unconscious plagiarism,"Studies of unconscious plagiarism have reported that people mistakenly include a partner's responses when trying to recall their own (recall-own), but also include their own when recalling a partner's (recall-partner). In a series of simulations we test if a fluency/memory-strength-based explanatory account can accommodate performance in the unconscious plagiarism paradigm. We show that responding on the basis of the typicality of items alone (guessing without memory) cannot account for participants' performance. Adding memory for items generated at study can account for performance in the recall-own but not the recall-partner task, even when we assume that participants in the recall-partner task strategically withhold more fluent items from report. This suggests that judgements of items' memory strength alone cannot explain performance in the unconscious plagiarism paradigm.",>Nicholas Lange>Timothy Hollins,>Plymouth University>Plymouth University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0479/index.html
2017,When do learned transformations influence similarity and categorization?,"The transformational theory of similarity suggests people are sensitive to the number of transformation operations needed to make two compared representations match. Although this theory has been quite influential, little is known about how transformations are learned and to what extent learned transformations affect similarity judgments. This paper presents two experiments addressing these questions, in which people learned categories defined by an arbitrary transformation. In Experiment 1, when the transformations were directly visible, people had no trouble learning and applied their knowledge to both similarity and categorization judgments involving previously unseen items. In Experiment 2, the task required transformations to be inferred rather than observed. People were still able to learn the categories, but in this more difficult case ratings were less strongly affected by training. Overall, this work suggests that newly learned transformations can impact similarity judgments but the salience of the transformation has a large impact on transfer.",>Steven Langsford>Andrew Hendrickson>Amy Perfors>Daniel Navarro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0480/index.html
2017,Preschoolers and Infants Calibrate Persistence from Adult Models,"Perseverance, above and beyond IQ, predicts academic outcomes in school age children, however, little is known about what factors affect persistence in early childhood. Here, we propose a formal Bayesian model of how children might learn how to calibrate effort from observing adult models and then explore this idea behaviorally across two experiments in children and infants. Results from Experiment 1 show that preschoolers persist more after watching an adult persist, but only if the adult is successful at reaching their goal. Experiment 2 and a pre-registered replication extend these findings, showing that even infants use adult models to modulate their persistence, and can generalize this inference to novel situations. These results suggest that both preschoolers and infants are sensitive to adult persistence and use it to calibrate their own effort in far-reaching ways.",>Julia Leonard>Max Kleiman-Weiner>Yuna Lee>Josh Tenenbaum>Laura Schulz,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0481/index.html
2017,You can take a noun out of syntax...: Syntactic similarity effects in lexical priming,"Usage-based theories of syntax predict that words and syntactic constructions are probabilistically interconnected. If this is true, then words that occur in similar distributions of syntactic constructions should prime each other. These effects should be fine-grained; even small differences between the syntactic distributions of pairs of words of the same grammatical category should cause variation in priming. Prior research from production suggests that this prediction should hold even in tasks without any syntactic requirement. In this study, we introduce a measure of the similarity between the syntactic contexts in which two nouns occur. We show that this similarity measure significantly predicts visual lexical decision priming magnitudes between pairs of nouns. This finding is consistent with the predictions of usage-based theories where fine-grained similarity of syntactic usages between prime-target pairs affects decision latencies, over and above any effects attributable to semantic similarity.",>Nicholas Lester>Laurie Feldman>Fermin Moscoso del Prado Martin,">University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, USA>The University at Albany, SUNY>University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0482/index.html

We sought to understand how people might use this relationship in choosing among risky gambles. To do so we, manipulated risk-reward structures of monetary gambles to be either negatively or positively correlated, or uncorrelated. After substantial exposure to these environments, participants completed a speeded choice task among non-dominated gambles. Eye-tracking data from this task suggests that participants often shifted their attention to mainly one attribute in the correlated conditions, in which the risk-reward relationship was present. This was an adaptive strategy that resulted in a similar proportion of expected-value maximizing choices, compared to a more compensatory processing strategy.",>Christina Leuker>Timothy J.

Generally, the distance between such vectors is used as a measure of the semantic similarity between the word meanings they represent. One important way of evaluating the performance of these vectors has been to use them to answer vocabulary multiple choice questions (MCQs) where the participant is asked to judge which of several choice words is closest in meaning to a stem word. The existing vocabulary MCQ tests used in this way have been very useful but there are some practical problems in their use as general evaluation measures. Here, we discuss why such tests remain useful evaluation measures, introduce a new vocabulary test, evaluate several current sets of semantic vectors using the new test and compare their performance to human data.",>Joseph Levy>John Bullinaria>Samantha McCormick,">University of Roehampton, UK>University of Birmingham, UK>University of Roehampton, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0484/index.html
2017,“I’m Better than You at Labeling!”: Preschoolers Use Past Reliability when Accepting Unexpected Labels,"How do young children decide to trust testimony that contradicts their initial beliefs? The current study examined whether children rely on cues to informant credibility (i.e., history of accuracy) to determine if they would endorse an unexpected label from an informant. Three- and 4-year-olds (N = 60) saw a picture of a hybrid artifact that consisted of features of two typical familiar artifacts. Children made initial judgments about the name of the hybrid object and subsequently received a different name offered by an informant who had earlier either accurately or inaccurately named familiar objects. Children were more willing to revise their own judgment and accept the unexpected label if it was from a previously accurate informant than if it was from someone who had made obvious naming errors. This suggests that preschool-aged children selectively revise their own knowledge; they are more trusting toward sources proven accurate than inaccurate.",>Xiaoqian Li>W.

It remains unclear how the two skills influence each other. Here we investigated the modulation of music reading expertise on visual processing of English words through an ERP study. Participants matched English real, pseudo, and non-words preceded by musical segments or novel symbol strings in a sequential matching task. Musicians showed smaller N170 amplitude in response to English non-words preceded by musical segments than by novel symbol strings in the right hemisphere. This effect was not observed in real or pseudo-words, or in any of non-musicians’ responses. Similar to English non-words, musical segments do not have morphological rules or semantic information, giving rise to this modulation effect. This finding suggested a shared visual processing mechanism in the right hemisphere between music notation and English non-word reading, which may be related to serial symbol processing as suggested by previous studies.",>Tze Kwan Li>Hei Yan Veronica Chan>Luhe Li>Janet H.

In this study, we report on research into the effects of metaphor on evaluative judgment, another aspect of decision-making that has been less well studied than reasoning. We use a cross-linguistic difference in the metaphors used by English and Spanish speakers to discuss economic change to investigate how metaphorical language affects evaluative judgment.

The nested, multiscale nature of language implies that even simple acts of text production, such as typing a sentence, entail complex interactions involving multiple concurrent processes. As such, text production may have much in common with other cognitive phenomena thought to emerge from multiplicative interactions across temporal scales, namely those that exhibit fractal properties. We investigated the relationship between fractal scaling and the quality of produced text. Participants (N=131) wrote essays while their keystrokes were recorded. Fractal analyses were then performed on time series of interkeystroke intervals (IKIs). Results showed that fractal properties characterizing IKIs positively predicted expert ratings of essay quality, even after accounting for essay length.

Participants completed two consistent experimental sessions, with a reflected motion session in between. While reaction time in the reflected motion session was slower than in the normal motion session, participants demonstrated a learning improvement in the second consistent motion session. This improvement correlated with more linear trajectories in the reversed and second normal motion sessions, which could be due to increased attention to visual feedback. Participants fell into one of two clusters depending on their preference for proximal/distal or awkward/smooth movements in the reversed session.

2017,"The development of turn-taking: Pre-schoolers may predict what you will say, but they don’t use those predictions to plan a reply.","Whereas adults exchange conversational turns very rapidly, children often respond after long gaps. However, it has been proposed that the infrastructure necessary to take turns develops in infancy. Why are children slow to respond to turns? Adults’ turn-taking skills, it has been argued, rely on an ability to both predict when the current turn will end and prepare a response as soon as possible. In two experiments, we ask how these two abilities (prediction and early preparation) develop. Adults and 3-to-5-year-olds answered yes/no questions while playing an iPad-based maze game. Distributional analysis of answer latencies suggest that (i) neither children nor adults rely on fine-grained predictions of turn duration and (ii) both children and adults use predictions about turn content to prepare their answer early. In sum, by the age of three, children already have the cognitive architecture necessary to take turns successfully. ,",>Laura Lindsay>Chiara Gambi>Hugh Rabagliati,">University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0490/index.html

In these, curved mouse trajectories toward one of two fixed response locations reveal the evolution of certainty about a cognitive task that participants solve. We present a paradigm in which selection of the response location is itself the cognitive task. From among items in a visual scene, participants select a target that is described by a spatial relation (e.g., ""the red to the left of the green""), where one target item (here, ""red"") matches the description better than alternative same-colored targets.

Properties of probability distributions over predictions are often difficult to study in natural language. To obtain precise control over these distributions, we created artificial languages consisting of sequences of shapes. The languages were constructed to vary the uncertainty of the probability distribution over predictions as well as the probability of the predicted item. Participants were exposed to the languages in a self-paced presentation paradigm, which provides a measure of processing difficulty at each element of a sequence. There was a robust pattern of graded predictability: shapes were processed faster the more predictable they were, as in natural language. Processing times were also affected by the uncertainty (entropy) over predictions at the point at which those predictions were made; this effect was less consistent, however.",>Tal Linzen>Noam Siegelman>Louisa Bogaerts,">Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France>Hebrew University, Jersualem, Israel>Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0492/index.html

Alternatively, explaining could lead learners to explore more, especially after encountering evidence that suggests their current beliefs are incorrect.

Thus, we required participants to engage in shallow processing (Experiment 1: Sensibility Judgement), or deep processing (Experiment 2: Interpretation Generation). Results showed that the increase of both variables made it more likely to accept a metaphor. However, whereas ease of simulation (EoS) contributed to the speed of processing at both levels of depth, linguistic distributional frequency (LDF) only affected the speed in shallow processing. Specifically, LDF acted as a heuristic, both to speed up responses to accept metaphors as sensible when the frequency is high, and to flag up potentially unsuccessful processing when it is low.

This may occur by semantic priming, where featuring images of physical activity increases the mental accessibility of the concept of exercise, making it more ‘fluent’ and therefore more influential on people’s behaviour. We tested how the format of labels (image vs. text) and representation of energy (‘activity’ vs. ‘calorie) affected mental accessibility of exercise in a word-fragment completion task and participants’ behavioural intentions for exercise (N = 142). Participants exposed to calorie labels produced more exercise-related words and viewed an imagined exercise scenario as shorter and more enjoyable. Images led to higher intentions to exercise than text when they described activities but they led to lower intentions to exercise than text when they described calories. Findings suggest that activity labels do not trigger more activity related thoughts, but could increase exercise intentions only if presented in pictorial format.",>Dawn Liu>Marie Juanchihch,">University of Essex, Colchester, Essex, United Kingdom>University of Essex, Colchester, Essex, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0495/index.html

Yet, it remains unclear whether this companionship also appears in the realm of sensorimotor control. Grush’s (2004) and Pezzulo’s (2008, 2011) account of anticipatory representations provide a limited answer, as they are only suitable for forward models, but not the entire sensorimotor control. Rescorla’s (2016) representational explanation for sensorimotor psychology addresses several intentional states considered in Bayesian inference and optimal modeling. However, the above accounts does not explain how motor commands are produced and chosen in the course of sensorimotor control for maintaining accuracy of goal-achievement. The present paper aims to explain it with a representational account by considering instrumental representations of sensorimotor control, which appear at the intermediate level and are exemplified by motor commands and costs.

Experiment 1 shows that reaction times (RTs) to tones are affected by two factors: a) processing load, resulting in a tendency for RTs to decrease across a sentence, and b) a perceptual effect which adds to this tendency and moreover helps neutralise differences between sentence types. Experiment 2 successfully discriminates these two factors by registering event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a monitoring task, establishing that the amplitudes of the N1 and P3 components —the first associated with temporal uncertainty, the second with processing load— correlate with RTs. Experiment 3 then behaviourally segregates the two factors by placing the last tone at the end of sentences, activating a wrap-up operation and thereby both disrupting the decreasing tendency and highlighting structural factors.",>David J.

2017,Grasping Multisensory Integration: Proprioceptive Capture after Virtual Object Interactions,"According to most recent theories of multisensory integration, weighting of different modalities depends on the reliability of the involved sensory estimates. Top-down modulations have been studied to a lesser degree. Furthermore, it is still debated whether working memory maintains multisensory information in a distributed modal fashion, or in terms of an integrated representation. To investigate whether multisensory integration is modulated by task relevance and to probe the nature of the working memory encodings, we combined an object interaction task with a size estimation task in an immersive virtual reality. During the object interaction, we induced multisensory conflict between seen and felt grip aperture. Both, visual and proprioceptive size estimation showed a clear modulation by the experimental manipulation. Thus, the results suggest that multisensory integration is not only driven by reliability, but is also biased by task demands. Furthermore, multisensory information seems to be represented by means of interactive modal representations.",>Johannes Lohmann>Jakob Gütschow>Martin V.

In recent years, political campaigns have adopted micro-targeting strategies that segment voters into fine-grained clusters and target those cluster more specifically. At present, there is little evidence that explores the efficiency of this method. Through an Agent-Based Model, the current paper provides a novel method for exploring predicted effects of strategic persuasion campaigns. The voters in the model are rational and revise their beliefs in the propositions expounded by the politicians in accordance with Bayesian belief updating through a source credibility model. The model provides a proof of concept and shows strategic advantages of micro-targeted campaigning. Despite having only little voter data allowing crude segmentation, the micro-targeted campaign consistently beat stochastic campaigns with the same reach. However, given substantially greater reach, a positively perceived stochastic candidate can nullify or beat a strategic persuasion campaigns.",>Jens Koed Madsen>Toby D.

Here, we explore the possibility of growing a rational (Bayesian) conspiracy theorist through an Agent-Based Model. The agent has reasonable constraints on access to the total information as well its access to the global population. The model shows that network structures are central to maintain objectively mistaken beliefs. Increasing the size of the available network, yielded increased confidence in mistaken beliefs and subsequent network pruning, allowing for belief purism. Rather than ameliorating and correcting mistaken beliefs (where agents move toward the correct mean), large networks appear to maintain and strengthen them. As such, large networks may increase the potential for belief polarization, extreme beliefs, and conspiratorial thinking – even amongst Bayesian agents",>Jens Koed Madsen>Richard Bailey>Toby D.

2017,The dilution effect: Conversational basis and witness reliability,"The dilution effect occurs when the introduction of non-diagnostic information lessens the impact of diagnostic information despite having no relevance to the hypothesis in question. While the effect has been reproduced in several studies, the psychological basis of the effect remains unclear. Some believe it to be conversational while others believe it to be cognitive and social. The paper tests the conversational basis of the effect by removing the influence of the experimenter from the design. Rather, the studies make use of a legal setting with witness testimonies. The studies replicate the dilution effect, which suggests that the basis of the results in the original studies is not conversational. The results suggest that the credibility of the source strongly influences whether or not the effect occurs. If reliable sources provide the non-diagnostic information, the effect lessens. Conversely, if unreliable sources provide the non-diagnostic information, we observe a stronger dilution effect.",>Jens Koed Madsen>Ulrike Hahn>Marion Vorms,">University of Oxford>Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0504/index.html
2017,Influence of using 3D images and 3D-printed objects on spatial reasoning of experts and novices,"This study focuses on the infuence of a three-dimensional (3D) graphic image and a 3D-printed object on the spatial reasoning of experts and novices in the medical field. The spatial reasoning task of this study required doctors specializing in digestive surgery to infer cross sections of a liver with a 3D image and a 3D-printed object in a situation where liver resection surgery was simulated. The task performance was compared with that of university students who conducted the same task in Maehigashi et al. (2016). The results of the analysis indicated that the doctors showed the same task performance when using the 3D image and the 3D-printed object. However, the university students learned faster and inferred the inside of a liver structure more accurately with the 3D-printed object than with the 3D image, and they performed equally to the professional doctors.

2017,"Even when people are manipulating algebraic equations, they still associate numerical magnitude with space","The development of symbolic algebra transformed civilization. Since algebra is a recent cultural invention, however, algebraic reasoning must build on a foundation of more basic capacities. Past work suggests that spatial representations of number may be part of that foundation, but recent studies have failed to find relations between spatial-numerical associations and higher mathematical skills. One possible explanation of this failure is that spatial representations of number are not activated during complex mathematics. We tested this possibility by collecting dense behavioral recordings while participants manipulated equations. When interacting with an equation’s greatest [/least] number, participants’ movements were deflected upward [/downward] and rightward [/leftward]. This occurred even when the task was purely algebraic and could thus be solved without attending to magnitude (although the deflection was reduced). This is the first evidence that spatial representations of number are activated during algebra. Algebraic reasoning may require coordinating a variety of spatial processes.",>Tyler Marghetis>Robert Goldstone>David Landy,">Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0506/index.html
2017,Chunking Ability Shapes Sentence Processing at Multiple Levels of Abstraction,"Several recent empirical findings have reinforced the notion that a basic learning and memory skill—chunking—plays a fundamental role in language processing. Here, we provide evidence that chunking shapes sentence processing at multiple levels of linguistic abstraction, consistent with a recent theoretical proposal by Christiansen and Chater (2016). Individual differences in chunking ability at two different levels is shown to predict on-line sentence processing in separate ways: i) phonological chunking ability, as assessed by a variation on the non-word repetition task, predicts processing of complex sentences featuring phonological overlap; ii) multiword chunking ability, as assessed by a variation on the serial recall task, is shown to predict reading times for sentences featuring long-distance number agreement with locally distracting number-marked nouns. Together, our findings suggest that individual differences in chunking ability shape language processing at multiple levels of abstraction, consistent with the notion of language acquisition as learning to process.",>Stewart M.

2017,The Interaction of Worked-Examples/ Self-Explanation Prompts and Time on Algebra Conceptual Knowledge,"Success in Algebra I often predicts whether or not a student will pursue higher levels of mathematics and science. However, many students enter algebra holding persistent misconceptions that are difficult to eliminate, thus, hindering their ability to succeed in algebra. One way to address these misconceptions is to implement worked-examples and self-explanation prompts, which have been shown to improve students’ conceptual knowledge. However this effect seems to be greater after a delay. The current study sought to explore such time-related effects on algebra conceptual knowledge. In a year-long random-assignment study, students either studied worked-examples and answered self-explanation prompts (n = 132) or solved typical isomorphic problems (n = 140). A three-way mixed ANCOVA (pre-algebra knowledge x condition x time) found a significant condition by time effect.

2017,Semantic ambiguity effects: A matter of time?,"Are different amounts of semantic processing associated with different semantic ambiguity effects? Could this explain some discrepant ambiguity effects observed between and across tasks? Armstrong and Plaut (2016) provided an initial set of neural network simulations indicating this is indeed the case. However, their empirical findings using a lexical decision task were not clear-cut. Here, we use improved methods and five different experimental manipulations to slow responding---and the presumed amount of semantic processing---to evaluate their account more rigorously. We also expanded the empirical horizon to another language: Spanish. The results are partially consistent with the predictions of the neural network and differ in several important ways from English data.

2017,Inferring Intentional Agents From Violation of Randomness,"Humans have a strong “cognitive compulsion” to infer intentional agents from violation of randomness and such an agency–nonrandomness link emerges early in development. In two studies, we directly quantified, formalized, and compared both ends of this link for the first time. In Experiment 1, two groups of participants viewed the same 256 binary sequences and classified each as generated by agents/non-agents or by nonrandom/random processes. We found a strong correlation between two judgments: sequences viewed as more agentive also tended to be judged as less ran- dom. In Experiment 2, another two groups were asked to produce sequences that others might appreciate as agentive or nonrandom. Participant-generated sequences in the two conditions had a substantial overlap, indicating common guiding principles of agency and nonrandomness generation. Taken together, the present studies provide evidence for a shared cognitive basis of agency detection and subjective randomness.",>Yuan Meng>Tom Griffiths>Fei Xu,">Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States>Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States>Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0510/index.html
2017,Presentation Format Modulates Adults’ Automatic Processing of Proportions,"Whereas much is known about how humans categorize and reason based on absolute quantities, research investigating the processing of relative quantities, such as proportions, is comparatively limited. The current study used a Stroop-like paradigm to examine adults’ automatic processing of nonsymbolic proportions and how presentation formats modulate this processing. Participants were asked to compare individual components across proportions in six different presentation formats. Congruity between component size and overall proportion affected accuracy of comparison, such that participants were less accurate when proportion (the irrelevant dimension) was incongruent with absolute quantity (the relevant) dimension. Moreover, the congruity effect was modulated by the presentation format. These findings serve as evidence that humans automatically access relative quantity when presented in nonsymbolic formats and provide evidence that the strength of this processing is modulated by the format of presentation.",>Rui Meng>Percival Matthews,">University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0511/index.html
2017,Utilizing simple cues to informational dependency,"Participants can adequately take into account several cues regarding the weight they should grant majority opinions, but that they do not consistently take into account cues regarding whether the members of the majority have formed their opinions independently of each other. We suggest that these conflicting results can be explained by hypothesizing that some cues are evolutionarily valid (i.e. they were present and reliable during human evolution), and others not. Using this framework we derive and test hypotheses about two facets of informational dependency. The first 3 experiments show that participants adequately take into account cues to informational dependency when they are presented in a simple, evolutionarily valid way. Experiments 4 to 7 show that people consistently take into account shared motivation, but not shared cognitive traits, as a source of potential dependency, as predicted by the likely greater importance of differences in motivation during our evolutionary history.",>Hugo Mercier>Helena Miton,>CNRS>CEU,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0512/index.html

Here we examined the magnitude and lateralization of EEG indices during somatosensory anticipation elicited by a left or right directional cue indicating the bodily location of an upcoming tactile stimulus. In 50 children aged 6-8 years, somatosensory anticipation was accompanied by anticipatory negativity and alpha mu rhythm desynchronization at contralateral central electrode sites (C3 and C4) overlying the hand area of the somatosensory cortex. Individual differences in these contralateral brain responses during somatosensory anticipation were associated with scores on a flanker task of executive function. The results suggest that processes involved in directing attention in the tactile modality may overlap with those involved in broader executive function abilities.",>Staci Meredith Weiss>Peter Marshall,">Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA>Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0513/index.html
2017,Modelling Unsupervised Event Segmentation: Learning Event Boundaries from Prediction Errors,"Segmenting observations from an input stream is key to human cognition. Evidence suggests that humans refine this ability through experiences with the world. However, few models address the unsupervised development of event segmentation in artificial agents. This paper presents presents a computational model of how an intelligent agent can independently learn to recognize meaningful events in continuous observations. The agent's segmentation mechanism starts from a simple state and is refined. The agent's interactions with the environment are unsupervised and driven by its expectation failures. Reinforcement learning drives event boundary identification by reasoning over a gated-recurrent neural network's expectation failures. The learning task is to reduce prediction error by identifying when one event transitions into another. Our experimental results support that reinforcement learning can enable detecting event boundaries in continuous observations based on a gated-recurrent neural network's prediction error and that this is possible with a simple set of features.",>Katherine Metcalf>David Leake,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0514/index.html

We performed an experiment to test associations between grasps (precision or power grip) and several objects. We then ran simulations using a naive bayes classifier to study to what extent it could reproduce participants’ choice. This classifier had two learning matrices containing objects’ size associated with a grip by means of our experiment. When receiving a new object’ size it computed the probability for each grip to be adapted. The highest probability was considered to represent which grip was associated with the object by the classifier. Results show that the classifier can reproduce participants’ choice depending on the size of its learning matrices, and can quickly select the right type of grip for a majority of trials, showing that micro-affordances (Ellis & Tucker, 2000) can be reproduced through naive bayesian classification.",>Arthur-Henri Michalland>Arthur-Henri Michalland>Denis Brouillet>Philippe Fraisse,">Epsylon, Montpellier, Hérault, France>LIRMM, Montpellier, Hérault, France>Epsylon, Montpellier, Hérault, France>LIRMM, Montpellier, Hérault, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0516/index.html
2017,The Role of Schema-Governed Relational Categories in Analogical Inference,"The standard approach posits that analogical inferences are generated by copying unmapped base relations, substituting base entities by their corresponding target ones, and generating slots for unmapped base entities. Contra this account, results from Experiment 1 revealed that analogical inferences seldom include relations that resemble the base relation from which they were derived. Most of the inferences, however, could be categorized as exemplars of a schema-governed category capable of characterizing the base information to be projected. To gather further precision about the criteria that guide inference generation, in Experiment 2 we showed that analogical inferences tend to match the base information from which they are derived in values of salient dimensions of the relational category to which they belonged. Our results suggest that the relational constructs employed in modeling analogical inference should move beyond one-term multiplace predicates so as to include more complex relational structures.",>Ricardo A.

2017,An Investigation of Factors that Influence Resource Allocation Decisions,"We investigate how people allocate a limited set of resources between multiple risky prospects. We found that only a small percentage of decisions followed some form of naïve diversification or mean-variance optimization. In general, people were less mean-variance optimal than a naïve 1/N heuristic. Aspects of choice sets, such as domain, skew, and second order stochastic dominance, affected resource allocation decisions in a similar manner to their influence on single choice gambles. Individual traits traditionally linked to risk propensity seem to manifest in terms of the degree to which people are inclined to diversify. Lower risk aversion is linked to increasing diversification. Risk congruency, the degree to which peoples' self-reported and elicited risk aversion matches, moderates how susceptible people are to cost framing nudges. We find evidence for heterogeneous clusters where people either under-weight or over-weight segregated costs, leading to the same nudge producing opposite behavioral results.",>Percy Mistry>Jennifer Trueblood,">University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA>Vanderbilt University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0518/index.html

Preliminary results suggest that factors such as age, type of n-back, and baseline abilities significantly impact one’s ability to improve in training.

As such, we investigated if participants’ metacognitive judgments for text and diagrams (i.e., content evaluations; CEs) were significantly related to increased performance and higher confidence during multimedia learning. Metacognitive judgments and performance measures were collected from 48 undergraduate participants during 18 randomized trials. Results using multilevel modeling indicated that participants’ CEs for text-based content were significantly predictive of performance.

2017,Interactive Communicative Inference,"In the search for an understanding of human communication, researchers often try to isolate listener and speaker roles and study them separately. Others claim that it is the intertwinedness of these roles that makes human communication special. This close relationship between listener and speaker has been characterized by concepts such as common ground, backchanneling, and alignment, but they are only part of the picture. Underlying these processes, there must be a mechanism for making inferences about our interlocutors' understanding of words and gestures that allows us to communicate robustly and efficiently without assuming that we take the same words to have the same meaning. In this paper, I explore this relationship between language and concepts and propose an interactive mechanism that can facilitate these latent conceptual inferences.

At the beginning, problem-solvers had a constraint allocating the pieces into a geometric shape, but then relaxed this to reach the correct configuration at a later stage of problem solving. Participants’ subjective assessments of their confidence to reach the solution predicted neither the constraint relaxation nor the successful problem solving.

2017,First step is to group them: Task-dynamic model validation for human multiagent herding in a less constrained task,"Biological systems are capable of acting in a shared environment to produce emergent, self-organized behavior that is the result of the constraints imposed by local interactions– such as bird flocking or ant swarming behavior. These examples present minimal demands for a shared-intention between co-actors, whereas other instances necessitate the formation of a shared goal. In these goal-directed tasks, how much of the observed complexity can be explained by the constraints imposed by both the environment and adherence to the shared task goal? This paper begins to investigate this question by presenting results from a two-person cooperative “shepherding” task first developed in Nalepka et al. (2017) but with fewer constraints. Results provide further evidence that the emergent behavior is the result of the constraints imposed by the task.

Results showed that both of the conflicts occurred in the reaction time (RT) and there was an interaction between them. ERP results showed more negative amplitudes on N2 (276-326 ms) and P3 (396-726 ms) for IFOR-IFOR conflict of the 180° cannon angle condition and EFOR-IFOR conflict of the target cannon point-down condition. What’s more, there was also an interaction between these two conflicts on the P3 amplitudes (561-726 ms).

Distributed cognition is one of the few extant conceptual frameworks for a nonreductive understanding of social cognition. This concept’s prototypical cases are exclusively of technical-scientific human institutions, including ships, cockpits, and the Hubble Space Telescope. In the first part of the paper, we outline the properties of distributed cognitive systems. We look at the case of wolf (Canis lupus) packs as an instance of distributed cognition in nonhuman systems. Nevertheless, a broad range of social cognitive phenomena across human and animal populations may not fit into this conceptual framework. We present a case study of bird flocks as a counterexample to distributed cognition. We propose “swarm intelligence” as an alternative concept of nonreductive social cognition. This is not to replace distributed cognition as a concept, but to add to and diversify the taxonomy of nonreductive social cognitive systems.",>Zachariah A. Neemeh>Luis H.

This paper approaches the problem of modeling categorical perception from the ground up, using a linear model of the tuning properties of auditory neurons -- the spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF). An STRF which discriminates voiced from voiceless stops was derived from the TIMIT corpus, and two computer simulations were conducted to investigate its properties. In one simulation, this model neuron was found to exhibit a categorical response to a linear voice-onset-time continuum, closely tracking human behavior. In the second simulation, the STRF was found to exhibit a less categorical, more linear response to a stop-voicing continuum, also in line with human behavior. These two simulations show that perceptual responses to speech, whether non-linear or veridical, can be modeled by the action of auditory neurons.",>Chris Neufeld,>University of Maryland,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0529/index.html

We sought to investigate the effects of a brief, 10-minute meditation session on attention in novice meditators, compared to a control activity. We also tested moderation by individual differences in Neuroticism.

2017,Shared mechanisms for controlling egocentric bias during perspective taking and intertemporal choices,"We infer the thoughts and feelings of other people by taking their perspectives, the accuracy of which depends on abilities to control egocentric bias. Similar processes could arguably be used to understand how we would be affected by future events, such as delayed rewards in intertemporal decisions, by allowing us to accurately take the perspective of future selves. In this paper, we test this idea in two studies. In both studies, a positive relationship was identified between behavioural and neural markers of egocentric bias control and preferences for delayed rewards. The overall pattern of results suggest the overlap in processes of egocentric bias control and those that determine preferences in intertemporal choices, and demonstrate for the first time the effect of sexual arousal on social cognition in reducing abilities to separate one’s own perspective from others’.",>Garret O'Connell>Bhismadev Chakrabarti>Chun-Ting Hsu>Anastasia Christakou>Isabel Dziobek,">Berlin School of Mind & Brain, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Unter den Linden 6, 10099 Berlin, Germany>School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences,  University of Reading, Reading RG6 6AL, UK>Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University 460 Moore Building, University Park, PA 1680>School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences,  University of Reading, Reading RG6 6AL, UK>Berlin School of Mind & Brain, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Unter den Linden 6, 10099 Berlin, German",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0532/index.html
2017,The dot perspective task revisited: Evidence for directional effects,"Humans are highly social creatures. Evidence from the dot perspective task suggests that humans automatically track the perspective of other individuals – a disposition that, if true, may help to facilitate social interaction. However, variants of the original dot perspective task suggest the alternative interpretation that the effect in the task is not due to perspective taking. Here, we present a new variant, using improved stimuli to address these issues. Our results replicate previous findings, across both animate and inanimate stimuli, and suggest that the effect is due to directional cueing rather than automatic perspective taking.",>Cathleen O'Grady>Thom Scott-Phillips>Suilin Lavelle>Kenny Smith,">School of Philosophy, Psychology & Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh>Dept. of Cognitive Science, Central European University, Budapest>School of Philosophy, Psychology & Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh>School of Philosophy, Psychology & Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0533/index.html
2017,Creation of Spatial Mental Models with Figural Stimuli: Validation of the Emoji-based Spatial Integration Task,"The current study examined a new spatial integration (SI) task, based on figural rather than linguistic stimuli, to measure the construct of mental modeling ability. Previous tasks conflated linguistic ability with mental modeling ability by requiring sentence processing, which may have contributed to mixed findings with respect to the relationship between mental model ability and working memory capacity (WMC). The figural spatial integration task produced the canonical continuity effect, such that discontinuous items had lower accuracy than continuous items. Furthermore, WMC and visuospatial ability predicted SI task performance, and both were stronger predictors for the continuous condition. The interactions between predictors and task conditions suggest reliance on heuristics and/or rehearsal during performance of the more difficult discontinuous items.",>Polly O'Rourke>Nick Pandza>Susan Campbell,">University of Maryland Center for the Advanced Study of Language, College Park, MD, USA>University of Maryland Center for the Advanced Study of Language, College Park, MD, USA>University of Maryland Center for the Advanced Study of Language, College Park, MD, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0534/index.html
2017,A Domain-Independent Approach of Cognitive Appraisal Augmented by Higher Cognitive Layer of Ethical Reasoning,"According to cognitive appraisal theory, emotion in an individual is the result of how a situation/event is evaluated by the individual. This evaluation has different outcomes among people and it is often suggested to be operationalised by a set of rules or beliefs acquired by the subject throughout development. In addition, an individual might elicit more than one emotion at a time in reaction to an event. In this work, we show that: (i) the cognitive appraisal process can be realised without a complex set of rules; instead, we propose that this process can be operationalised by knowing only the positive or negative perceived effect the event has on the subject, thus facilitating extensibility and integrability of the emotional system; (ii) the final emotional state to attribute in relation to a specific situation is better explained by ethical reasoning mechanisms. These hypotheses are plausibly supported by our experimental results.",>Suman Ojha>Jonathan Vitale>Mary-Anne Williams,">University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia>University of Technology, Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia>University of Technology, Sydney",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0535/index.html

To test this, we used the visual world paradigm, in which counterfactual and indicative conditionals were heard while four images corresponding to the conjecture, such as an image of gloves and scarves, and the presupposed facts, such as an image of no gloves and no scarves, and two distractors were shown on the screen and eye movements were monitored. We found that people looked at the affirmative image in the indicative conditional, and both types of images (affirmative and negative) in the counterfactual conditional.

2017,Investigating Sensitivity to Shared Information and Personal Experience in Children’s Use of Majority Information,"When learning from others, rather than simply following the majority’s opinion, we need to accurately assess the quality of the information being provided and integrate it with our own personal experience. This is especially true if the majority has a lower quality of information when members shared evidence rather than collecting it independently. Previous work demonstrated that adults are sensitive to information quality, consistent to the predictions of a Bayesian rational model (Whalen, Griffiths, & Buchsbaum, in press). In two behavioural experiments, we investigated how preschoolers combined testimony from a majority that conflicted with a minority or with personal evidence. Unlike adults, children over-relied on the majority when given only testimony. However, when given their own conflicting evidence, children relied significantly less on the majority and over-relied on their own evidence. These findings help explain why children may follow the majority at times, but in others trust their own judgements.",>Kay Otsubo>Andrew Whalen>Daphna Buchsbaum,">University of Toronto>The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh>University of Toronto",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0537/index.html
2017,Do Speaker’s Emotions influence their Language Production? Studying the Influence of Disgust and Amusement on Alignment in Interactive Reference,"The influence of emotion on (the early stages of) speech production processes, notably content selection has received little scholarly attention. Goudbeek & Krahmer (2012) found evidence for alignment at the conceptual level: speakers may start using a dispreferred attribute over a preferred attribute in their referring expressions when they are primed by a pre-recorded female voice in a preceding interaction. The current study aimed to assess the role of emotion (using amusement and disgust) in alignment, while simultaneously replicating this finding in a more naturalistic setting involving two human participants in naturalistic dialogue. Our results replicate the findings by Goudbeek & Krahmer (2012), generalizing their findings to a much more naturalistic setting. In addition, we found that amused, but not disgusted speakers tend to use the preferred attribute more to describe objects to their conversational partner.",>Charlotte Out>Martijn Goudbeek>Emiel Krahmer,">Tilburg University, Tilburg, Noord-Brabant, Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, Noord-Brabant, Netherlands>Tilburg University, Tilburg, Noord-Brabant, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0538/index.html

However, only a little research has been performed on the prevention of Problematic Smartphone Usage (PSU). Behavioral economics has been applied to investigate how smartphone users respond to nudges that try to lower their smartphone usage. Findings revealed that the Total Screen On Time (SOT) decreased when nudging smartphone users with information on their usage behaviors.

One methodology used for examining this process is the Sound Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI), which presents participants with a number of flashes and either the same number of beeps (congruent) or a different number of beeps (incongruent), and requires the participant to respond by entering how many flashes they saw. The study expands on this research by examining the relative contributions of auditory and visual information on multisensory integration. While congruent and incongruent auditory stimuli affected visual perception (Experiment 1), there was little evidence that visual input affected auditory processing (Experiment 2). These findings support auditory dominance and modality appropriate hypothesis in adult populations and have implications on tasks that require integration across auditory and visual modalities.",>Jessica Parker>Chris Robinson,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0540/index.html
2017,The effect of acute physical activity on children’s memory for language,"Research on the relationship between acute physical activity and cognition in children has often found beneficial effects of exercise on a variety of cognitive abilities. One domain that remains underexplored, however, is the relationship between exercise and long-term memory in children, and in particular whether the general-domain effects observed in previous studies could translate to a school-based learning activity, such as vocabulary learning. To address this issue, this study focused on the possible effects that a bout of moderate, aerobic physical activity could have on the immediate and delayed recall of newly acquired word forms and form- meaning connections of children in a school setting. In line with previous research, the results show a positive effect of exercise, but only for word form recall. This study expands our understanding of the differential effects of exercise on memory, while raising questions regarding the possible moderating influence of gender and memory consolidation.",>Carla Pastorino Campos>John Williams,>University of Cambridge>University of Cambridge,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0541/index.html
2017,Replacing Language: Children Use Non-Linguistic Cues and Comparison in Category Formation,"Language is a powerful instrument for extracting relational information from stimuli. In a label extension task common labels invite comparison processes that help children focus on the more subtle relational similarity and away from the readily available perceptual similarity of the stimuli. The current experiment aims to explore whether non-linguistic representations of category membership are sufficient to invite such abstractions of relational information. Preschool children were asked to extend a category to either a relational or an object match. When given the opportunity to compare two instances of the category, and provided with a non-linguistic cue children extended the category to the relational match. These results further extend the benefit of comparison in learning, and suggest that language labels are not the only cue children can use in category formation.",>Margarita Pavlova,">New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0542/index.html
2017,When is Likely Unlikely: Investigating the Variability of Vagueness,"An important part of explaining how people communicate is to understand how people relate language to entities in the world. In describing measurements, people prefer to use qualitative words like `tall' without precise applicability conditions, also known as vague words. The use of vague language varies widely across contexts, individuals, and tasks (single reference vs. comparisons between targets), but despite this variability, is used quite successfully. A potential strategy for using vague language is to leverage the set of alternative descriptions to settle on the best option. To determine whether people use this strategy, we conducted an experiment where participants picked vague words from sets of alternatives to describe either probability or color values. We varied the set of alternatives from which participants could choose. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that people use the set of available options to pick vague descriptors.

2017,"Counterfactuals, indicative conditionals, and negation under uncertainty: Are there cross-cultural differences?","In this paper we study selected argument forms involving counterfactuals and indicative conditionals under uncertainty. We selected argument forms to explore whether people with an Eastern cultural background reason differently about conditionals compared to Westerners, because of the differences in the location of negations. In a 2 × 2 between-participants design, 63 Japanese university students were allocated to four groups, crossing indicative conditionals and counterfactuals, and each presented in two random task orders. The data show close agreement between the responses of Easterners and Westerners. The modal responses provide strong support for the hypothesis that conditional probability is the best predictor for counterfactuals and indicative conditionals. Finally, the grand majority of the responses are probabilistically coherent, which endorses the psychological plausibility of choosing coherence-based probability logic as a rationality framework for psychological reasoning research.",>Niki Pfeifer>Hiroshi Yama,">MCMP, LMU Munich, Germany>Osaka City University, Osaka, Osaka, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0544/index.html

The most frequently observed response type across all conditions was a class of conditional event interpretations of conditionals; it was followed by conjunction interpretations.

Across four conditions, we modified the testimony in an object-labeling task, to account for pragmatic principles. Four- and 5-year-olds were given a choice between an object endorsed by a three-person majority, or one endorsed by a single minority informant. Children were most likely to endorse the majority object in the unendorsed condition, in which the majority explicitly stated that the label applied to only one referent, whereas in the hidden condition, where only one object was present in the discourse, children chose objects endorsed by the majority and the minority equally, with conditions where the majority did not comment on the other item or expressed uncertainty about it intermediate. This suggests that children might not simply have a conformity bias; rather, they are sensitive to the majority’s implied intentions when learning from testimony.",>Theresa Pham>Jane C Hu>Daphna Buchsbaum,>University of Toronto>University of Washington>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0546/index.html

However, the plethora of apparently incommensurate approaches seems to undermine hope for a common computational foundation. Category theory provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for computation that includes recursion and corecursion. We show that corecursion unifies various cognitive behaviours for comparison and contrast in a principled and novel way. For instance, Chomsky's merge function is a universal morphism, which has a dual, called comerge. One implication of this work is that corecursion appears to be the rule rather than the (human) exception in contrast to Chomsky's view of recursion.",>Steven Phillips,">National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0547/index.html

However, such theories must also explain why each route is invoked, lest one can fit any data set with enough routes. One possible explanation is that route selection is based on a least-cost principle: the route that requires fewer cognitive resources (including time) relative to the goal at hand. We investigated this explanation with a dual-route version of visual search, where the target could be identified via opposing (easy or hard forms of) feature and conjunction search conditions. The data support a contextualized version of the least-cost principle in that the cost of computing least-cost also influences route selection: participants assessed alternatives, but only when the cost of that assessment was relatively low.",>Steven Phillips>Yuji Takeda>Fumie Sugimoto,">National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0548/index.html
2017,The Effect of Economic Scarcity Priming on Perception of Race,"Existing research suggests that White individuals are more likely to categorise biracial faces as Black in conditions of resource scarcity. It has been theorised that this effect is due to in-group boundaries becoming more exclusive in scarce conditions. An alternative explanation refers to implicit socio-economic association between Black individuals and lower level of resources. These two approaches entail different predictions for Black participants performing the categorisation task. If scarcity prompts greater in-group exclusivity, Black participants should, ceteris paribus, categorise more biracial faces as White. If, however, scarcity invokes socio-economic status associations, Black participants should categories biracial faces in the same way as White participants. Experiment 1, explored the effects of priming on White and Black groups. It provided support for the implicit socio-economic association theory. Furthermore, experiment 2 on Asian sample, provided additional support as Asian participants showed the same pattern of response.

2017,Perception is in the Details: A Predictive Coding Account of the Psychedelic Phenomenon,"Psychedelic substances are used for clinical applications (e.g., treatment of addictions, anxiety and depression) as well as an investigative tool in neuroscientific research. Recently it has been proposed that the psychedelic phenomenon stems from the brain reaching an increased entropic state. In this paper, we use the predictive coding framework to formalize the idea of an entropic brain. We propose that the increased entropic state is created when top-down predictions in affected brain areas break up and decompose into many more overly detailed predictions due to hyper activation of 5-HT2A receptors in layer V pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that this novel, unified theoretical account can explain the various and sometimes contradictory effects of psychedelics such as hallucination, heightened sensory input, synesthesia, increased trait of openness, ‘ego death’ and time dilation by up-regulation of a variety of mechanisms the brain can use to minimize prediction under the constraint of decomposed prediction.",>Sarit Pink-Hashkes>Iris van Rooij>Johan Kwisthout,>Radboud University>Radboud University>Radboud University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0550/index.html
2017,Repetition improves memory by strengthening existing traces: Evidence from paired-associate learning under midazolam,"Here, we examined how repetition under midazolam, a benzodiazepine that prevents the storage of novel associations, affects cued-recall performance of paired-associates. We contrasted word pairs that were initially studied and tested repeatedly without any successful recall prior to the midazolam injection, with other pairs that were studied for the first time after the injection of midazolam. According to our SAC (Source of Activation Confusion) memory model, repetition leads to strengthening existing memory traces rather than creating multiple traces for each repetition. As such, it predicts that repetition under midazolam should benefit only pairs that were originally studied prior to the midazolam injection. This prediction was confirmed. The results suggest that memory traces for pairs studied prior to the midazolam injection were strengthened under midazolam. However, word pairs that had not been studied prior to the injection were not bound in long-term memory because midazolam prevents the formation of new associations.",>Vencislav Popov>Lynne Reder,">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA>Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0551/index.html

Thus, understanding the critical precursors of fraction knowledge is important for the development of instructional materials. The aim of the present study was to examine whether instructional format affected children’s learning and transfer of fractions. Six- to 8-year-old children participated in a longitudinal study (pre/post design) in which they received a fraction-training intervention. We manipulated the extent to which real-world instruction was grounded in visual vs. symbolic representations. We find that 1st and 2nd graders were able to learn fraction concepts following this intervention and that the extent to which the instructional stimuli were grounded in visual vs. symbolic representations affected children’s proportional reasoning knowledge in a transfer task.

2017,Is ambiguity detection in haptic imagery possible? Evidence for Enactive imaginings,"A classic discussion about visual imagery is whether it affords reinterpretation, like discovering two interpretations in the duck/rabbit illustration. Recent findings converge on reinterpretation being possible in visual imagery, suggesting functional equivalence with pictorial representations. However, it is unclear whether such reinterpretations are necessarily a visual-pictorial achievement. To assess this, 68 participants were briefly presented 2-d ambiguous figures. One figure was presented visually, the other via manual touch alone. Afterwards participants mentally rotated the memorized figures as to discover a novel interpretation. A portion (20.6%) of the participants detected a novel interpretation in visual imagery, replicating previous research. Strikingly, 23.6% of participants were able to reinterpret figures they had only felt. That reinterpretation truly involved haptic processes was further supported, as some participants performed co-thought gestures on an imagined figure during retrieval. These results are promising for further development of an Enactivist approach to imagination.",>Wim Pouw>Asimina Aslanidou>Kevin Kamermans>Fred Paas,>Erasmus University Rotterdam>Erasmus University Rotterdam>Erasmus University Rotterdam>Erasmus University Rotterdam,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0553/index.html
2017,Categorical vs Coordinate Relationships do not reduce to spatial frequency differences,"Categorical and coordinate stimulus processing were hypothesized by Kosslyn (1987) to be lateralized visual tasks, differentiated by task-relevant spatial frequencies. Slotnick et al.\ (2001) directly tested Kosslyn's hypothesis and concluded that the lateralization presents only when tasks are sufficiently difficult. Our differential encoding model is a three layer neural network that accounts for lateralization in visual processing via the biologically plausible mechanism of differences in connection spread of long-range lateral neural connections (Hsiao, Cipollini, \& Cottrell, 2013). We show that our model accounts for Slotnick's data and that Slotnick's analysis does not convincingly explain their results. Instead, we propose that Kosslyn's initial hypothesis was based on an incorrect assumption: categorical and coordinate stimuli are not solely differentiated by spatial frequencies. The results that our model captures cannot be reproduced by Ivry and Robertson's (1998) “Double Filtering by Frequency” theory, which is driven solely by lateralized spatial frequency processing.",>Vishaal Prasad>Ben Cipollini>Garrison Cottrell,">University of California, San Diego>Classy.org>University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0554/index.html

Whether these beneficial effects hold true in the domain of statistics is, however, an open question. Moreover, the role of refutation texts for the accuracy in judging one’s own comprehension (metacomprehension accuracy) has received little attention. Therefore, we conducted an experiment in which students with varying levels of statistical misconceptions read either a standard text or a refutation text in statistics, judged their text comprehension, and completed a comprehension test. The results showed that when students read the standard text, having more misconceptions resulted in poorer text comprehension and more inaccurate metacomprehension as indicated by overconfident predictions. In contrast, when students read the refutation text, the number of misconceptions was unrelated to text comprehension and metacomprehension accuracy. Apparently, refutation texts help students to pay attention to inaccuracies in their knowledge and, thereby, can promote self-regulated learning from texts.",>Anja Prinz>Stefanie Golke>Jörg Wittwer,">Department of Educational Science, University of Freiburg, Germany>Department of Educational Science, University of Freiburg, Germany>Department of Educational Science, University of Freiburg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0555/index.html

Across all 8 tasks, 88.84% of participants provided estimates best fit by a mixed log-linear model, and the weight of the logarithmic component (λ) decreased with age. After controlling for age, the λ significantly predicted arithmetic skills, whereas parameters of other models failed to do so.

One such theory, proposed by Bach (2011, 2014), is based on the Structure-Mapping theory of analogy, which has been shown to play a key role in cognitive development. There is evidence that children are more likely to pass false belief tasks when trained using stories that are easy to compare via structural alignment, as opposed to stories that are difficult to compare in this way (Hoyos, Horton & Gentner, 2015).

But how people learn, infer and predict this structure is not well understood. Here we explore everyday scene understanding as a case study of people’s structural knowledge and reasoning. We introduce a probabilistic model over scene graphs that can learn the relational structure of objects and their arrangements and support inference and generation. Our model was able to learn the underlying structure of real-world scenes, and use it for inference and compression. In two human psychophysical experiments we found that a corresponding computational cognitive model was able to explain how people learn novel scene distributions and use it for classification and construction.

2017,Challenging the superficial similarities superiority account for analogical retrieval,"The predominant view concerning determinants of analogical retrieval is that it is preferentially guided by superficial cues. In order to test the cognitive plausibility of an abstract retrieval, we constructed a story-recall task in which structural matches between analogy source candidate situations and target cue stories were salient. In experiment 1, we showed that such salient structural similarities induce retrievals even when the subjects had several source candidate situations sharing superficial similarities with the target cue. Experiment 2 was designed to test whether the encoding was sufficiently oriented on salient structures to drive retrievals even if the subjects only possess one source candidate situation with superficial matches in memory. The results of the two present experiments lead us to conclude that abstract encoding and retrieval actually occur in some contexts induce a superiority of structural similarities on superficial ones in retrieval.

2017,Improving a Fundamental Measure of Lexical Association,"Pointwise mutual information (PMI), a simple measure of lexical association, is part of several algorithms used as models of lexical semantic memory. Typically, it is used as a component of more complex distributional models rather than in isolation. We show that when two simple techniques are applied--(1) down-weighting co-occurrences involving low-frequency words in order to address PMI's so-called ""frequency bias,"" and (2) defining co-occurrences as counts of ""events in which instances of word1 and word2 co-occur in a context"" rather than ""contexts in which word1 and word2 co-occur""--then PMI outperforms default parameterizations of word embedding models in terms of how closely it matches human relatedness judgments. We also identify which down-weighting techniques are most helpful. The results suggest that simple measures may be capable of modeling certain phenomena in semantic memory, and that complex models which incorporate PMI might be improved with these modifications.",>Gabriel Recchia>Paul Nulty,">University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom>University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0561/index.html

Our findings demonstrate that the choice of whether to be implicit is determined by the activation levels of representations specific to implicatures and that inference and implications have overlapping processing mechanisms.,>Alice Rees>Lewis Bott,">Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom>Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0562/index.html
2017,How could a rational analysis model explain?,"Rational analysis is an influential but contested account of how probabilistic modeling can be used to construct non-mechanistic but self-standing explanatory models of the mind. In this paper, I disentangle and assess several possible explanatory contributions which could be attributed to rational analysis. Although existing models suffer from evidential problems that question their explanatory power, I argue that rational analysis modeling can complement mechanistic theorizing by providing models of environmental affordances.",>Samuli Reijula,">University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0563/index.html
2017,Randomness in binary sequences: Conceptualizing and connecting two recent developments,"Recent theoretical research has shown that the assumptions that both laypeople and researchers make about random sequences can be erroneous. One strand of research showed that the probability of non-occurrence of streaks of repeated outcomes (e.g., HHHHHH) is much higher than that for a more irregular sequence (e.g., HTTHTH) in short series of coin flips. This tallies with human judgments of their likelihood of occurrence, which have conventionally been characterized as inaccurate and heuristic-driven. Another strand of research has shown that patterns of hits and misses in games like basketball, traditionally seen as evidence for the absence of a hot-hand effect, actually support the presence of the effect. I argue that a useful way of conceptualizing these two distinct phenomena is in terms of the distribution of different sequences of outcomes over time: Specifically, that streaks of a repeated outcome cluster whereas less regular patterns are more evenly distributed.",>Stian Reimers,">City, University of London, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0564/index.html
2017,Using punctuation as a marker of sincerity and affective convergence during texting,"Face-to-face communication is a rich, natural form of communication that incorporates multimodal behavioral cues belying meaning and intention. However, computer-mediated communication (e.g., texting) removes many of the multimodal cues in face-to-face communication (e.g., vocal prosody). Recent research has suggested that punctuation might mimic vocal prosody in text (Gunraj et al., 2016), but there is no clear indication of what the overall effects may be. Therefore, the current study investigates the use of punctuation to express intonation. We first replicate Gunraj and his colleagues by showing that a single word ending in a period promotes the appraisal of negative affect. Interestingly, we extend this research by demonstrating that intonational punctuation has the potential to increase social distance, which our preliminary results suggest may occur through processes of emotional contagion and interactive alignment.",>Katherine Reynolds>Blair Casarotto>Sarah Noviski>Jennifer Roche,">Kent State University>University of Wisconsin-Madison>Bowling Green State University>Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0565/index.html

Across two studies, we examined how graph features influenced probabilistic judgments in graph-based social network analysis and identified multiple heuristics that participants used to inform these judgments. Study 1 demonstrated that participants’ judgments were influenced by information about direct connections, base rates, and layout proximity, and participants’ self-reported strategies also reflected use of this information. Study 2 replicated findings from Study 1 and provided additional insight into the hierarchical ordering of these strategies and the decision process underlying judgments from social network graphs.",>Rebecca Rhodes>Isaiah Harbison>Nathan Bos>Celeste Paul>Clay Fink>Anthony Johnson,>Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory>Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory>Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory>U.S. Department of Defense>Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory>Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0566/index.html
2017,Explicit Predictions for Illness Statistics,"People’s predictions for real-world events have been shown to be well-calibrated to the true environmental statistics (e.g. Griffiths and Tenenbaum 2006). Previous work, however, has focused on predictions for these events by aggregating across observers, making a single estimate for the total duration given a current duration. Here, we focus on assessing predictions for both the mean and form of distributions in the domain of illness duration prediction at the individual level. We assess understanding for both acute illnesses for which people might have experience, as well as chronic conditions for which people are less likely to have knowledge. Our data suggests that for common acute illnesses people can accurately estimate both the mean and form of the distribution. For less common acute illnesses and chronic illnesses, people have a tendency to overestimate the mean duration, but still accurately predict the distribution form.",>Talia Robbins>Pernille Hemmer,>Rutgers University>Rutgers University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0567/index.html

It encodes post-lexical pragmatic functions such as sentence modality and discourse contexts. The present experiment investigates how and when listeners integrate intonational information to anticipate reference resolution. While most work on the real-time processes of intonation-based intention recognition has utilized eye tracking, the present study uses the mouse tracking paradigm, a valuable complementary method to investigate the time course of speech processing. Participants had to choose an interpretation based on pre-recorded instructions containing different intonation contours. Recordings of the x,y coordinates of participants’ computer mouse movements reveal that listeners integrate intonational information rapidly as soon as they become available and anticipate potential referential interpretations early on.",>Timo B.

2017,Beyond candidate inferences: People treat analogies as evidence,"People use analogies for many purposes such as building mental models, making inspired guesses, and extracting relational structure. Here we examine whether and how analogies have more direct influence on knowledge: Do people treat analogies as probabilistically true explanations for uncertain propositions? We report an experiment that explores how a suggested analogy influences people’s confidence in inferences. Participants made predictions while evaluating a suggested analogy and observed evidence. In two conditions, the evidence is either consistent or in conflict with propositions based on the suggested analogy. We analyze the responses statistically and in a psychologically plausible Bayesian network model. We find that analogies are used for more than just generating candidate inferences. They act as probabilistic truths that affect the integration of evidence and confidence in the target and source domains. People readily treat analogies not as a one-way projection from source to target, but as a mutually informative connection.",>Brad Rogers>David Landy,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0570/index.html

In this paper, we used data from a categorization task and an associated model to assess the attentional bias of people with varying levels of depressive symptoms. Attentional bias was operationalized as the parameter estimate in a prototype model of categorization. For estimation, we used a Bayesian hierarchical mixture approach. We expected to find a positive correlation between depressive symptoms and an AB for negative material and a negative correlation between depressive symptoms and a bias toward positive material. Despite good model fit, Bayesian regression analyses revealed weak or moderate evidence in favor of the null model assuming no association between attentional preferences and depressive symptoms, both for negative and positive material.",>Isa Rutten>Wouter Voorspoels>Ernst H.

2017,Is it fair? Textual effects on the salience of moral foundations,"Many of the important decisions we make have moral implications. Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt & Joseph, 2004) identifies 5 distinct styles of moral reasoning that may be applied to such decisions. This paper explores how reading text that emphasizes one of these styles might affect our reasoning. After participants read a series of tweets that emphasized the Fairness/Cheating foundation they exhibited an increased reliance on this style compared to when they read tweets emphasizing the Care/Harm foundation. This affected participants’ answers to a questionnaire designed to measure the perceived importance of the different foundations, as well as in their rating of the foundations evident in other tweets. Interestingly, this effect was short lived and was not observed for the Care/Harm foundation. These results suggest that exposure to the moral reasoning of others might temporarily influence what moral arguments we are likely to accept and employ.",>Eyal Sagi,>University of St. Francis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0572/index.html

The present paper proposes qualitative extension of the causal power theory to the situation where a binary cause influences a continuous effect, and induces causal power under various ceiling situations with the continuous outcomes. We systematically manipulated the type of outcome and the contingency information and found that people estimate causal strength based on the linear-sum rule for continuous outcomes and the noisy-OR rule for binary outcomes. In the partial ceiling situation where causal power is partially inferred but not precisely estimated, the distribution of participants’ judgments was bimodal with one mode at the minimum value and the other at the maximum value, suggesting some participants made conservative estimates while others made optimistic estimates. These results are generally consistent with the predictions of the causal power theory.

In this study, we analysed the effects of two types of spatial training and handedness on primary school children’s arithmetical ability. The participants were pre-tested on a test of arithmetic and assigned to one of three groups: (a) one hour of mental rotation and translation training, (b) one hour of mental translation training only, or (c) a no-contact group. The results showed no significant difference between training groups and a significant interaction between training group and category of handedness. Interestingly, only extremely right-handed children seemed to benefit from the training. These outcomes suggest that any spatial training needs to include mental rotation activities to be effective, and that the relationship between spatial training and achievement mathematics appears to be moderated by handedness.",>Giovanni Sala>Martina Bolognese>Fernand Gobet,">University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom>University of Milan>University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0574/index.html

In this work, we focus on the causal variant of the FP, the Causal Frame Problem (CFP). We first introduce a notion called Potential Level (PL). We substantiate the claim that PL may bear on how time is encoded in the mind. Using PL, we propose an inference framework, PLIF, which permits a boundedly-rational approach to the CFP, formally articulated at the algorithmic level. We show that PLIF is consistent with several findings in the causal judgment literature, and that PL and PLIF make a number of predictions, some of which are supported by existing findings.",>Ardavan Salehi Nobandegani>Ioannis N.

However, we are yet to learn its exact mechanisms conclusively. The temporal bisection task is ideal to investigate the circuitry underlying time perception. Caffeine, a commonly used stimulant, has been known to play a role in modulation of time perception. The objective of this article is to explore the role of caffeine, a neuromodulator, in the perception of time in human beings by conducting suitable experiments. The experiment shows that an expansion of time is perceived by subjects after caffeine ingestion and that caffeine has an accelerating effect on our time perception system. Additionally, we present a preliminary 2-step decision model that fits the results of the experiment and potentially gives insights into the mechanisms of caffeine.

2017,Peculiarity doesn't trump ordinarity: On recognition memory for exceptions to the category rule,"While exceptions to a regularity might be rare, categories that have exceptions are not. Previous studies on learning categories that have exceptions suggested special status of exceptional items in memory (e.g. Palmeri & Nosofsky, 1995, Sakamoto and Love, 2004). However, this might be true only for a special kind of exceptions – those that call for forming complex binding structures, and could be learned only if they are fully memorized. In the two experiments in this study, we show that memory for exceptions is not better than memory for regular category members (Experiment 1). On the contrary, both children and adults had better memory for the features of regular items (Experiment 2). In addition, adults, but not 4-year-olds showed better memory for the rule than for probabilistic features.

During learning sessions, students studied arithmetic word problems that can be solved in two different ways: an expansion strategy and a factorization one.

2017,Aging of the Exploring Mind: Older Adults Deviate more from Optimality in Complex Choice Environments,"Older adults (OA) need to make many important and difficult decisions. Often, there are too many options available to explore exhaustively, creating the ubiquitous tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. How do OA make these complex tradeoffs? We investigated age-related shifts in solving exploration-exploitation tradeoffs depending on the complexity of the choice environment. Participants played four and eight option bandit problems with numbers of gambles and average rewards available on the screen. OA reliably performed worse in a more complex choice environment and were also more deviant from an optimality model (Thompson sampling), which keeps track of uncertainty beyond just the mean or last reward. OA seem to process important information in more complex choice environments sub-optimally, suggesting limited representations of future rewards. This interpretation fits to multiple contexts in the complex cognitive aging literature, in particular to the context of challenges in the maintenance of goal-directed learning.",>Job Schepens>Ralph Hertwig>Wouter van den Bos,">Freie Universität, Berlin, Berlin, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Berlin, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Berlin, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0582/index.html

2017,The roles of item repetition and position in infant sequence learning,"We examined how saliency and consistency of distributional information guides infants’ detection, extraction, and generalization of sequential patterns. Experiment 1 examined whether 11- and 14-month-olds could learn a “repetition anywhere” rule (e.g., ABBC, AABC, ABCC). Experiment 2 examined whether 11- and 14-month-olds could generalize a “medial repetition” rule, and Experiment 3 examined whether 11-month-olds could identify an edge-positioned nonadjacent dependency. Infants were habituated to 4-item audiovisual sequences containing repetition- and/or position-based structure and then tested with the “familiar” structure vs. “novel” (random) sequences. Eleven-month-olds failed to learn the repetition rule both when the structure appeared in a variable (Experiment 1) and a medial (Experiment 2) position. Fourteen-month-olds learned repetition rules under both conditions. In Experiment 3, 11-month-olds learned a nonadjacent dependency in sequences identical to those that tested repetition learning in Experiment 2.

2017,Silent gesture and noun phrase universals,"In this paper we investigate a hypothesized cognitive bias for isomorphic mappings between conceptual structure and linear order in the noun phrase. This bias has been proposed as a possible explanation for a striking asymmetry in the typology of the noun phrase–linear orders which place the adjective closest to the noun, then the numeral, then the demonstrative, are over-represented in the world’s languages. Previous experimental work has provided evidence that an isomorphism bias affects English-speaking learners’ inferences about the relative order of modifiers in an artificial language. Here, we use the silent gesture paradigm to explore whether the isomorphism bias influences spontaneous gestures innovated by participants in a modality with which they have relatively little prior experience. We find that gesture order largely conforms to the same striking pattern found in noun phrase typology, supporting the role of the isomorphism bias in shaping the emergence of language (and language-like) systems.",>Marieke Schouwstra>Simon Kirby>Jennifer Culbertson,">Centre for Language Evolution, University of Edinburgh>Centre for Language Evolution, University of Edinburgh>Centre for Language Evolution, University of Edinburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0585/index.html

Four-year-old children were taught three new label/objects pairs, where the speaker’s references to objects were either continuous (i.e., clusters of utterances referred to the same object) or discontinuous (i.e., no two sequential sentences referred to the same object). In two experiments, children learned new word/object mappings more successfully when object labels were accompanied by continuous references to the same object. This research reveals how discourse cues support children’s encoding of new words, and in doing so, advances our understanding of the specific features of parents’ language input that facilitate children’s language development.",>Jessica F.

We inspect the anticipatory visual attention during sentence processing together with the cognitive load induced at the points of the gaze cue, and the linguistic referent. Employing a novel measurement of cognitive load - the Index of Cognitive Activity (Marschall, 2000) allowed us to simultaneously consider both anticipatory eye-movements and cognitive load. Our results show that the gaze cue is being followed, and considered as a relevant piece of information, which subsequently reduces the cognitive load on the linguistic referent. In addition, we found that considering the gaze cue is in itself not costly, unless it cues an object mismatching with the previous linguistic context.",>Mirjana Sekicki>Maria Staudte,>Saarland University>Saarland University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0587/index.html
2017,Gestural Hesitation Reveals Children’s Competence on Multimodal Communication: Emergence of Disguised Adaptor,"Speakers sometimes modify their gestures during the process of production into adaptors such as hair touching or eye scratching. Such disguised adaptors are evidence that the speaker can monitor their gestures. In this study, we investigated when and how disguised adaptors are first produced by children. Sixty elementary school children participated in this study (ten children in each age group; from 7 to 12 years old). They were instructed to watch a cartoon and retell it to their parents. The results showed that children did not produce disguised adaptors until the age of 8. The disguised adaptors accompany fluent speech until the children are 10 years old and accompany dysfluent speech until they reach 11 or 12 years of age. These results suggest that children start to monitor their gestures when they are 9 or 10 years old. Cognitive changes were considered as factors to influence emergence of disguised adaptors.",>Kazuki Sekine,>Radboud University/ Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0588/index.html
2017,Adaptability and Neural Reuse in Minimally Cognitive Agents,"Cognitive agents are continuously faced with new problems. To facilitate adaptation, emerging theories of neural reuse propose that evolution might often favor re-purposing existing brain structures for new functions. This paper presents a novel approach to the study of neural reuse based on the evolution of simulated agents in an object-categorization task. We artificially evolve populations of dynamic neural networks to perform two variants of a categorization task that alternate over evolutionary time. We find that populations become increasingly adaptive over repeated exposures to the tasks. Analysis of evolved networks reveals two types of equally-fit solutions: one that is specialized to a given task variant and does not adapt to changes easily; and another that is more general, in that it can adapt to the other task with minimal change to its structure. Interestingly, we find that populations exposed to alternating tasks spontaneously locate the latter type of structures.",>Matthew Setzler>Eduardo J.

2017,The role of talker similarity in the perceptual learning of L2 tone categories,"Different hypotheses were proposed concerning the role of talker variability in lexical learning. It remains unclear whether new phonetic categories are acquired as episodic memory traces with talkers’ voice information preserved or as abstract categories. The current study investigated the role of voice similarity in perceptual learning of Cantonese tones. Six high-variability training sessions were given to 12 Mandarin speakers. Voice similarity was controlled in the training and pre-and posttests. Results indicate that the training positively transferred to both similar and dissimilar talkers. However, in the pretest, the performance was not significantly different between similar and dissimilar voices, whereas significant better performance was found in the similar voices in the posttest. These results suggest that learners retained speakers’ information in the learning process and made use of such information for future perception. This implies that lexical tones are probably encoded episodically in the mental representation of Mandarin L2 learners.",>Jing Shao>Joanna Chor Yan Mak>Caicai Zhang,>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0590/index.html

Specifically, we address the issue of representing probability distributions using neural circuits and combining them in meaningful ways to perform inference. We show that applying these methods to the life span inference task matches human performance on this task better than an ideal Bayesian model due to the use of neuron tuning curves. We also describe potential ways in which humans might be generating the priors needed for this inference. This provides an initial step towards better understanding how Bayesian computations may be implemented in a biologically plausible neural network.",>Sugandha Sharma>Aaron Voelker>Chris Eliasmith,">Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada>Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0591/index.html
2017,The Role of Causality in Temporal Binding: Evidence for an Intentional Boost,"Temporal binding refers to the subjective contraction in time between actions and their consequences. Since it was reported in 2002 the effect has generated much interest, although a consensus regarding the mechanisms behind it remains elusive. While multiple theoretical accounts have been proposed, a key point of contention remains whether the effect is the result of the perception of intentionality or causality. We deployed a new apparatus to compare intentional to mechanical causation. Thirty participants reported the interval between two events in self-causal, mechanical-causal and non-causal conditions. The results of a Bayesian analysis pointed to smaller temporal estimates in the self-causal condition compared with the mechanical-causal condition, in addition to smaller estimates in the mechanical-causal condition compared with the non-causal condition. The evidence presented here suggests that causality alone may be sufficient for temporal binding to occur, but that this effect is boosted by the presence of intentional action.",>Daniel Shiloh>Peter White>Marc Buehner,>Cardiff University>Cardiff University>Cardiff University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0592/index.html
2017,Familiarity-matching in decision making: Experimental studies on cognitive processes and analyses of its ecological rationality,"Previous studies have shown that individuals often make inferences based on heuristics using recognition, fluency, or familiarity. In the present study, we propose a new heuristic called familiarity-matching, which predicts that when a decision maker is familiar (or unfamiliar) with an object in a question sentence, s/he will choose the more (or less) familiar object from the two alternatives. We examined inference processes and ecological rationality regarding familiarity-matching through three studies including behavioral experiments and ecological analyses. Results showed that participants often used familiarity-matching in solving difficult binary choice problems, and that familiarity-matching could be applied in an ecologically rational manner in real-world situations.

2017,Bridging a Conceptual Divide: How Peer Collaboration Facilitates Science Learning,"Collaboration is an effective means of learning new information, but is collaboration productive in domains where collaborators hold qualitatively different conceptions of the domain’s causal structure? We explored this question in the domain of evolutionary biology. College undergraduates (n = 44) completed an assessment of their evolutionary reasoning by themselves (pretest), with a partner (dyad test), and several months later (posttest). Collaboration proved more effective for lower-scoring partners than higher-scoring partners. Lower-scoring partners not only increased their score from pretest to dyad test but also maintained higher scores at posttest. Follow-up analyses revealed that, for lower-scoring partners, the smaller the difference between their pretest score and their partner’s pretest score, the greater the gain from pretest to posttest. Bridging the gap between a novice’s view of a conceptually complex domain and an expert’s view appears to require instruction that is initially more aligned with the former than the latter.",>Andrew Shtulman>Andrew Young,>Occidental College>Occidental College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0594/index.html
2017,A Data-Driven Approach for Making Analogies,"Making analogies is an important way for people to explain and understand new concepts. Though making analogies is natural for human beings, it is not a trivial task for a dialogue agent. Making analogies requires the agent to establish a correspondence between concepts in two different domains. In this work, we explore a data-driven approach for making analogies automatically. Our proposed approach works with data represented as a flat graphical structure, which can either be designed manually or extracted from Internet data. For a given concept from the base domain, our analogy agent can automatically suggest a corresponding concept from the target domain, and a set of mappings be-tween the relationships each concept has as supporting evidence. We demonstrate the working of this algorithm by both reproducing a classical example of analogy inference and making analogies in new domains generated from DBPedia data.",>Mei Si>Craig Carlson,>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0595/index.html
2017,Word-object associations are non-selective in infants and young children,"For decades, theories of early word learning have assumed that infants are equipped with learning biases that help them learn words at a fast pace. One of these biases, called Mutual Exclusivity, suggests that infants reject second labels for name-known objects. Our first two experiments, with children and with infants, suggest that novelty preference during Mutual Exclusivity tasks should not be taken as evidence that associations between novel labels and name-known objects have not taken place. A third experiment, supplemented with computational modeling, ruled out cascaded activation patterns as alternative explanations and, instead, confirmed that word-object associations are non-selective throughout infancy and childhood.",>Ming Yean Sia>Julien Mayor,">The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus>University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0596/index.html
2017,The tortoise wins only when the race is long: How the task environment changes the behavior of Tetris models,"Tetris can be viewed as a highly complex decision making task, and used as a paradigm for studying human expertise. We hypothesized that models capable of playing Tetris for a long time are doing so by adopting slow but steady strategies to accumulate points, while human players are much more prone to using high-risk, high-reward strategies that earn more points in a shorter time frame. This work used the MindModeling.org computational cognitive modeling platform to develop the best models capable of playing long term games and short term games, and then compared the performance of the two. The best long term model adopted the slow and steady strategy, while the best short term model displayed the higher-risk, higher-reward strategy that more closely matches behavior observed in human players. Models that ""trained long"" but ""played short"" did worse than those that both trained and played ""short.""",>Catherine Sibert>Wayne Gray,">Rensselear Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, United States>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Latham, New York, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0597/index.html
2017,Information density of encodings: The role of syntactic variation in comprehension,"The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis links production strategies with comprehension processes, predicting that speakers will utilize flexibility in encoding in order to increase uniformity in the rate of information transmission, as measured by surprisal (Jaeger, 2010). Evidence in support of UID comes primarily from studies focusing on word-level effects, e.g. demonstrating that surprisal predicts the omission/inclusion of optional words. Here we investigate whether comprehenders are sensitive to the information density of alternative encodings that are more syntactically complex. We manipulated the syntactic encoding of complex noun phrases in German via meaning-preserving pre-nominal and post-nominal modification in contexts that were either predictive or non-predictive. We then used the G-maze reading task to measure online comprehension during self-paced reading. Results were consistent with the UID hypothesis. In predictive contexts, post-nominal encodings elicited a more uniform distribution of processing effort. Conversely, in non-predictive contexts, more uniform effort was found for pre-nominal encodings.",>Les Sikos>Clayton Greenberg>Heiner Drenhaus>Matthew Crocker,>Saarland University>Saarland University>Saarland University>Saarland University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0598/index.html

We use this model to bridge between previously disconnected domains, as diverse as infant habituation and visual working memory capacity in adults.

As the primary test for the Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH), the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) examines these factors. Skin conductance shows anticipatory physiological responses on the IGT supporting SMH. Pupil dilation offers an alternative physiological marker. Predictive effects of anticipatory pupillary responses to positive and negative decks on IGT performance were examined in an extended IGT. The extended Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) examined the relationship between reflective thinking and IGT performance. Data demonstrated correlations between reflective thinking and performance from the second block onwards and that task learning continued into the additional blocks - performance was not optimized even in the final block. Regression analysis showed both anticipatory pupil dilation for disadvantageous and advantageous decks, and reflective thinking were strong predictors of IGT performance. While both emotional and reflective processes are implicated in IGT performance, analytic cognition is more important than traditionally acknowledged.",>Boban Simonovic>Edward Stupple>Maggie Gale>David Sheffield,>University of Derby>University of Derby>University of Derby>University of Derby,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0600/index.html

For example, speakers normally gesture significantly more than listeners. These visible, overt movements are normally analysed using full body video or motion capture. Here we explore the potential of a 'minimal' approach to sensing these participatory movements in part of the natural environment of everyday interactions; chair seat covers. Using custom built fabric sensors we test whether we can detect people's involvement in a conversation using only pressure changes on the seats they are sitting in. We show that even from this impoverished data we can distinguish between talking, backchanneling and laughter; each state is associated with distinctive patterns of pressure change across the surface of the chair. We speculate on the possible applications of this new, unintrusive form of social sensing for architecture, performance and augmented human interaction.",>Sophie Skach>Patrick G. T.

What is usually found in the so-called hint/no-hint paradigm is that spontaneous solution to a problem is hard to achieve. This leaves the possibility for individual differences. This study searched for and found a positive correlation to exist between scores on the Cognitive Reflection Test and spontaneously solved analogical problems which, although a weak one, possibly accounts for the differences that exist between people who need a hint to solve an analogical problem, and people that do not need a hint.",>Slavi Slavov>Penka Hristova,>NBU>NBU,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0602/index.html
2017,Gender or Community: What Drives STEM Interest Among Middle School Students?,"Much attention has been given to increasing women’s and girls’ interest and participation in STEM fields. One way of increasing STEM interest is to target STEM-gender stereotypes by presenting students with female stereotype-disconfirming exemplars. However, the exemplar approach has had mixed effectiveness in adolescent populations. The present study examined middle school students’ interest in STEM fields and their communal goal interest. Participants were given different interventions that either presented a female exemplar of a scientist or leveraged communal goals. Results found no gender differences in STEM interest, but a correlation between communal goal endorsement and a belief that STEM careers are compatible with communal goals. The intervention that leveraged communal goals effectively increased STEM interest for some students, while the exemplar interventions were ineffective. These findings suggest that with regard to STEM interest in early adolescence, endorsement of communal goals may be a more influential factor than gender category membership.",>Evans Smalley>Jennifer Kaminski,">Wright State University , Dayton, Ohio, United States>Wright State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0603/index.html

Here we explored the origins of these social-group based inferences by examining whether infants generalize food preferences across members of an arbitrary social group. Experiment 1 demonstrated that infants expected two individuals to share food preferences when they belonged to the same social group, but not when they belonged to two different social groups. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings to social groups that were labeled with adjectives instead of nouns.

Here we test how these different processes might combine in a motion-prediction task that can be solved either by simulation or by reasoning about the topology of the scene. Participants were asked to predict which of two goals a computerized ball would reach first, but in some of these scenes the ball was ‘contained’ in the same space as one goal but was topologically separated from the other. Even in these contained scenes, participants responded faster when they received motion information that would speed up simulation but not affect topological parsing. This suggests that simulation contributes to predicting short-range motion, even when alternate strategies are available.",>Kevin Smith>Filipe Peres>Edward Vul>Joshua Tenebaum,>MIT>Columbia>UCSD>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0605/index.html
2017,Promoting Spontaneous Analogical Transfer: The Role of Category Status,"Analogical comparison promotes spontaneous transfer by encouraging a more abstract representation that may be easier to retrieve. The category status hypothesis states that: if knowledge is represented as a relational category, it is easier to activate as a result of categorizing (as opposed to cue-based reminding). To investigate these two pathways to analogical transfer, participants were assigned to different study conditions: 1) standard comparison of two analogs; 2) standard comparison followed by a second comparison of two new analogs; or 3) a guided category-building task based on sequential summarization. Category-building showed a reliably higher rate of spontaneous transfer during an analogical problem solving task than standard comparison (numerically higher than double-comparison). Another experiment measured spontaneous remindings to cues on the basis of matching structure. Category-building showed a reliable advantage over both comparison conditions. This supports categorization as a novel pathway to spontaneous transfer by enhancing retrieval of structurally similar information.",>Sean Snoddy>Kenneth Kurtz,">Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, United States>Binghamton University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0606/index.html

Such crossmodal associations can arise from innate structural connections in the brain, statistical correlations in the environment, or through language. In a large group of participants across a wide age range and language background, we tested crossmodal associations between pitch and 7 dimensions in comparison modalities. We found evidence supporting the existence of all 7 types of associations, but the strength of association varied by dimension. Pitch-angularity and pitch-weight judgments were the most robust associations. In general, strength of associations increased with age, with significant associations occurring in the oldest age group (age 19+), consistent with experiential accounts of crossmodal associations.",>Laura Speed>Ilja Croijmans>Sarah Dolscheid>Asifa Majid,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>University of Cologne, Cologne, NRW, Germany>Radboud University, The Netherlands, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0608/index.html

We used a novel cooperation task between involving dynamic assignment of Teacher and a Learner under conditions of uncertainty both about reward and about who is the expert at any given time. The task is similar to Theory of Mind tasks but actually gives the participants a stake in the outcome.

On rare occasions, a false rumor is exposed as the lie that it is. More commonly, false rumors obtain apparent verification by corroboration from what seems to be a second independent source. However, in complex social networks, that a putative second source is almost never actually independent of the original source. In this work, rumor network simulations demonstrate how easy it is for a node in the network to be fooled into thinking it has received independent verification of a false rumor, when in fact that “second source” can be traced back to the original source. By developing an understanding of the circumstances under which the spread of false rumors, “alternative facts,” and fake news can be controlled, perhaps the field can help prevent them from ruining elections and ruining entire nations.",>Michael Spivey,">University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0610/index.html

In many real world situations (e.g., when talking to a non-expert, non-native speaker, or a child), this process of audience design involves identifying gaps in the lexical-semantic knowledge of the listener and selecting alternative expressions. We examine speaker adaptation to a listener with incomplete lexical knowledge in the spatial domain, specifically a failure to comprehend the basic terms left/right. Experimental and modeling results provide evidence of rapid adaptation that is modulated by the availability of alternative spatial terms. We consider how our approach relates to recent work in computational pragmatics, and suggest that adaptation to the lexical knowledge of the addressee is an important but relatively understudied topic for future research.",>Sadhwi Srinivas>Barbara Landau>Colin Wilson,>Johns Hopkins University>Johns Hopkins University>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0611/index.html

Here, we explore whether children can use their knowledge of an existing word sense to constrain their interpretation of a new word meaning. Across two studies, we teach 3- and 4-year-olds and adults novel words for materials, and manipulate whether those words are also used flexibly, to label objects made from those materials. We find that participants of all ages assign markedly different interpretations to the object labels when they have a prior, material meaning: Rather than extending them to other objects of similar shapes, they extend them on the basis of shared material, thus overriding the well-documented shape bias. These findings suggest that language learners can use a word’s prior meaning to learn about the structure of its new meaning.",>Mahesh Srinivasan>Catherine Berner>Hugh Rabagliati,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0612/index.html

This paper considers the implications of this straightforward observation upon the psychological process of preference construction. We show that this constraint renders observers with random access memory susceptible to tail risks. We show that this difficulty can be rectified by permitting observers to weight memory retrieval for such observations, that outcome utility cannot be used for this purpose, but information-theoretic surprise can serve as a useful proxy for it. Using two novel experiments, we present evidence in support of our account. With the first, we show that humans find surprising experiences easier to remember. With the second, we show that surprising experiences in the past have a greater influence on future decisions than is statistically warranted. This twofold demonstration substantiates a psychologically plausible account for the origin of subjective probability distortions.",>Nisheeth Srivastava>Ed Vul,>IIT Kanpur>UCSD Psychology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0613/index.html
2017,Memory of relative magnitude judgments informs absolute identification,"The question of whether people store absolute magnitude information or relative local comparisons of magnitudes has remained unanswered despite persistent efforts over the last three decades to resolve it. Absolute identification is one of the most rigorous experimental benchmarks for evaluating theories of magnitude representation. We characterize difficulties with both absolute and relative accounts of magnitude representation and propose an alternative account that potentially resolves these difficulties. We postulate that people store neither long-term internal referents for stimuli, not binary comparisons of size between successive stimuli. Rather, they obtain probabilistic judgments of size differences between successive stimuli and encode these for future use, within the course of identification trials. We set up a Bayesian ideal observer model for the identification task using this representation of magnitude and propose a memory-sampling based approximation for solving it. Simulations suggest that the model adequately captures human behavior patterns in absolute identification.",>Nisheeth Srivastava,>IIT Kanpur,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0614/index.html

From over 20,000 player record we identify 3475 players who have played on 50 or more days. Our focus is on how variability in elements of play affect subsequent skill development. After validating the persistent influence of differences in initial performance between players, we test how practice spacing, social play, play mode variability and a direct measure of game-world exploration affect learning rate. These latter two factors do not affect learning rate. Players who space their practice more learn faster, in line with our expectations, whereas players who coordinate more with other players learn slower, which contradicts our initial hypothesis. We conclude that not all forms of practice variety expedite skill acquisition.

We first discuss the modeling choices made by Franke and Jaeger (2016) and others who have used similar frameworks to model reference game tasks. We introduce a space of different plausible Bayesian models based on this work, and compare models’ fit to new experimental data to replicate the basic findings of Franke and Jaeger regarding the strong role for perceptual salience (e.g., the primacy of color over shape as a differentiating property for possible referents) and linguistic category (e.g., a preference for nouns over adjectives) in pragmatic reference resolution. We then uncover an additional possible effect of what we call labeling, whereby a hearer may simply ignore non-salient, non-differentiating semantic properties.",>Jon Stevens,>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0616/index.html

Here, we investigate a general ability to learn how to use actions to control schedules of reinforcement. In Experiment 1, participants quickly discovered the optimal rate of responding on an action that controlled the rate of reward contingent on performing a different action.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare processes of spontaneous concept formation in infants and adults using an experimental paradigm based on novelty preference. We discovered that both infants and adults show evidence of category learning (Experiment sensory demands to the two groups, we explored how varying parameters of the learning context affect dynamics of category formation.

This study investigated the role of iconicity for language acquisition in Turkish Sign Language (TID). Participants were 43 signing children (aged 10 to 45 months) of deaf parents. Sign production ability was recorded using the adapted version of MacArthur Bates Communicative Developmental Inventory (CDI) consisting of 500 items for TID. Iconicity and familiarity ratings for a subset of 104 signs were available. Our results revealed that the iconicity of a sign was positively correlated with the percentage of children producing a sign and that iconicity significantly predicted the percentage of children producing a sign, independent of familiarity or phonological complexity. Our results are consistent with previous findings on sign language acquisition and provide further support for the facilitating effect of iconic form-meaning mappings in sign learning.",>Beyza Sumer>Clara Grabitz>Aylin Kuntay,>Koc University>Radboud University>Koc University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0619/index.html
2017,A Minimal Neural Network Model of The Gambler's Fallacy,"The gambler's fallacy has been a notorious showcase of human irrationality in probabilistic reasoning. Recent studies suggest the neural basis of this fallacy might have originated from the predictive learning by neuron populations over the latent temporal structures of random sequences, particularly due to the statistics of pattern times and the precedence odds between patterns. Here we present a biologically-motivated minimal neural network model with only eight neurons. Through unsupervised training, the model naturally develops a bias toward alternation patterns over repetition patterns, even when both patterns are equally likely presented to the model. Our analyses suggest that the way the neocortex integrates information over time makes the neuron populations not only sensitive to the frequency signals but also relational structures embedded over time. Moreover, we offer an explanation for how higher-level cognitive biases may have an early start at the level of sensory processing.",>Yanlong Sun>Hongbin Wang,">Texas A&M; University Health Science Center, Houston, Texas, USA>Texas A&M; University Health Science Center, Houston, Texas, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0620/index.html

We examined the temporal consistency of repeated responses to the moral foundations questionnaire over short time periods, fitted a set of mixed effects models to the data and compared them.

The experimenter pointed at an object using either typical pointing or “enforced pointing” behind a wall that was either opaque or transparent. In enforced pointing, the experimenter moved his arm in an arc movement. The participants guessed which object was being denoted. The wall was also either relatively high or relatively low. When the participants looked at typical pointing, they thought that objects both in front of the wall and behind the wall were being denoted. However, when they looked at enforced pointing, they more frequently thought that objects behind the wall were denoted.

Results from an experimental condition in which the relations involved in the compared situations were explicitly highlighted, showed that general object similarities (membership to same category) positively affected the evaluations of analogical quality. In contrast, no such effect was found under another experimental condition in which the analogical comparisons between the same situations were framed by a schema-governed category. An analysis of participants' justifications revealed that the object similarities that were taken into account under this second condition were related to central dimensions of the schema-governed category that was used to frame the analogies. We explain these findings within the category assignment approach developed by Minervino et al., and discuss the implications of this alternative perspective of analogical reasoning for the role of similarities between entities playing several thematic roles.",>Lucía Micaela Tavernini>Máximo Trench>Valeria Olguín>Ricardo A.

Perhaps the most salient is applause but they use their hands to make other visible movements: to fix hair, adjust glasses, scratch ears. The question we address here is whether these apparently incidental movements may provide systematic clues about an audience’s level of engagement with a performance. We investigate this in the context of contemporary dance performances by analysing audience hand movements in four performances at the London Contemporary Dance School. Hand movements were tracked using a reflective wristband worn by each audience member. A blob detection algorithm applied to the video recording examined whether changes in hand movement are associated with audience arousal levels to the performance. The results show that hands move least during the most preferred and most during the least preferred dance pieces.

Particularly, young children have trouble when the objects in the task are not strongly associated with each other, and/or when there are strong associative lures among the potential answers. Here, we examine whether successive trials that repeat the same relation needed to solve the analogy can help overcome some of the challenges with weakly associated items. In the first of two experiments, our results were mixed. In the second, we simplified the design, and were able to more clearly show a benefit of repeating relations across consecutively solved problems.",>Jean-Pierre Thibaut>Micah Goldwater,">Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Dijon, France>The University of Sydney",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0625/index.html

We manipulated the semantic distance between the two training items (e.g., two bracelets versus a bracelet and a watch), and the semantic distance between the training items and the test items (e.g., a pendant versus a bow tie). We tested whether smaller semantic distance between training items would lead to more taxonomic (vs. perceptual) choices at test, than broader semantic distance during training, especially in the case of distant test stimuli. Results revealed main effects of induction distance, of generalization distance and that only children aged 6 years benefited from broader semantic during training at test. Four year-old children failed to generalize to far test stimuli even with semantically distant training items.

Cognitive scientists can help address this issue by illuminating how people conceptualize the scientific process, paving the way for improved communication with the public. We recruited a large sample of lay Americans, as well as academics in the sciences and humanities, to answer a series of questions assessing their views about science. Because metaphors have been identified as useful tools for communicating about complex domains, we asked participants to choose which of two metaphors––working on a puzzle or scaling a mountain––best captured their beliefs about the scientific process. Results revealed substantial variation in perceptions of science across groups, and we highlight the ways in which scientists seem to conceptualize science differently from non-scientists.

We addressed this issue in a large, pre-registered framing study, comparing the effects of describing the role of police officers as (a) metaphorical guardians of a community (b) literal protectors of a community, and (c) a no-label control. We found no main effect of framing condition, suggesting that positively valenced metaphors may exert little influence on their own in this domain. However, we did observe an interaction between condition and political ideology, such that the guardian metaphor was especially effective at improving attitudes towards police officers for liberals, whose initial approval ratings were relatively low.",>Paul Thibodeau>Stephen Flusberg,">Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH, USA>Purchase College, State University of New York, Purchase, New York, United States of America",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0628/index.html
2017,Part-whole categorization is culture-specific,"We present two experiments on the role of culture in the categorization of object part-whole structures. A triadic categorization task pitted shape against function as factors driving similarity judgments on selected parts of different types of objects. Speakers of American English were significantly more likely than speakers of two indigenous languages of Mexico, Tseltal Maya and Isthmus Zapotec, to choose categorization by function, even when familiarity of the various stimulus objects was factored in. In the second study, members of the two indigenous groups matched parts of a doll to parts of novel objects of unfamiliar shape. The Tseltal participants were significantly more likely to match according to a shape-analytical algorithm rather than global analogy, consistent with predictions based on prevalent strategies in verbal part labeling in the two languages. We conclude that while cognition of object parts undoubtedly has a strong biological basis, there are also robust cultural effects.",>Timothy Tilbe>Juergen Bohnemeyer>Gabriela Perez Baez>Dedre Gentner,">University at Buffalo, the State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, USA>Department of Linguistics, University at Buffalo - SUNY, Buffalo, NY, U.S.A.>Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution>Northwestern University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0629/index.html
2017,The Stroop Effect From a Mixture of Reading Processes: A Fixed-Point Analysis,"For the last 80 years, the Stroop task has been used to test theories of attention and cognitive control and it has been applied in many clinical settings. Most theories posit that the overwhelming power of written words overcomes strict instructions to focus on print color and ignore the word. Recent evidence suggests that trials in the Stroop task could in fact be a mixture of reading trials and non-reading trials. Here we conduct a critical test of this mixture hypothesis, where a mixture of processes should satisfy the fixed-point property (Falmagne, 1968)",>Gabriel Tillman>Zachary Howard>Paul Garret>Ami Eidels,>University of Newcastle>University of Newcastle>University of Newcastle>University of Newcastle,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0630/index.html
2017,Interleaving area problems in the 4th grade classroom: What is the role of context and practice?,"Typical mathematics instruction involves blocked practice across a set of conceptually similar problems. Interleaving, or practice across a set of conceptually dissimilar problems, improves learning and transfer by repeatedly reloading information and increasing discrimination of problem features. Similarly, comparing problems across different contexts highlights relevant and irrelevant knowledge. Our experiment is the first to investigate the relative effects of interleaving geometry problems and interleaving contexts. Thirty-three fourth-grade students received the same practice problems but were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: interleaved by math skill, interleaved by context, and interleaved by math skill and by context (i.e., hyper-interleaved). Afterward, each participant was exposed to tests assessing declarative and procedural knowledge. The results suggest that interleaving math skill within and between varying contexts may enhance the acquisition of mathematical procedures.",>Rachael Todaro>Bradley Morris,>Kent State University>Kent State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0631/index.html
2017,Scarcity impairs online detection and prospective memory,"Operating under limited resources poses significant demands on the cognitive system. Here we demonstrate that people under time scarcity failed to detect time-saving cues as they occur in the environment (Experiment 1a). These time-saving cues, if noticed, would have saved time for the time-poor participants. Moreover, the visuospatial proximity of the time-saving cues to the focal task determined successful detection, suggesting that scarcity altered the spatial scope of attention (Experiment 1b & 1c). People under time scarcity were also more likely to forget previous instructions to execute future actions (Experiment 2). These instructions, if remembered and followed, would have saved time for the time-poor participants. Failures of online detection and prospective memory are problematic because they cause neglect and forgetting of beneficial information, perpetuating the condition of scarcity. The current study provides a new cognitive account for the counterproductive behaviors in the poor, and relevant implications for interventions.",>Brandon Tomm>Jiaying Zhao,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0632/index.html

There is, however, a long-lasting debate in psycholinguistics concerning whether the latter hinders referential processing. We present evidence from an eye tracking experiment recording fixations as well as the Index of Cognitive Activity – a novel measure of cognitive workload – supporting the view that over-specifications facilitate processing. We further present original evidence that, above and beyond the effect of specificity, referring expressions that uniformly reduce referential entropy also benefit processing.",>Elli Tourtouri>Francesca Delogu>Matthew Crocker,">Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Saarland, Germany>Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Saarland, Germany>Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Saarland, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0633/index.html

One model, the social influence model, reproduced the choices that participants took by modeling both the cognitive processes the participant engaged in and the social influences that the participant saw. The second model, the pure cognitive model, used only cognitive capabilities and did not model any social influences that the participant saw. Somewhat surprisingly, the two models showed no difference in quality of fit (the pure cognitive model actually fit slightly better than the social influence model), suggesting that social influence models should take cognitive functions into account in their theories.",>Greg Trafton>Malcolm McCurry>Kevin Zish>Laura Hiatt>Sunny Khemlani,>NRL>NRL>GMU>NRL>NRL,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0634/index.html
2017,Why Teach How Things Work? Tracking the Evolution of Children’s Intuitions About Complexity,"Children and adults are notoriously poor at remembering mechanistic information. As a result, teaching mechanism has come under increasing scrutiny in science education. However, while a rich memory for mechanistic details may be out of the average student’s grasp, we argue exposure to mechanism does not leave students empty-handed. Instead, it refines their intuitions about science and the world in significant ways. In this study, we focused on one particular kind of intuition: causal complexity. Children ages 6-11 rated the complexity of two entities and were then given either mechanistic or non-mechanistic information about them. We tracked the evolution of their intuitions about complexity immediately after and three weeks later. Children in the mechanistic condition demonstrated a greater shift compared to the non-mechanistic condition. This contradicts the notion that mechanism provides learners with few benefits, while also demonstrating how mechanism can be a powerful force in shaping children’s intuitions.",>Emmanuel Trouche>Aaron Chuey>Kristi Lockhart>Frank Keil,">Department of Psychology, Yale University>Department of Psychology, Yale University>Department of Psychology, Yale University>Department of Psychology, Yale University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0635/index.html
2017,The Impact of Presentation Order on the Attraction Effect in Decision-making,"The attraction effect in decision-making is a famous example of how preferences are influenced by the availability of other options. One emerging hypothesis for the effect is that biases in attention influence preferences. In the past, these ideas have been explored indirectly through computational modeling and eye tracking. In the present paper, we directly manipulate attention through presentation order, presenting choice options sequentially. Our results show that presentation order has a large impact on the effect – some presentation orders enhance the effect and other orders reverse the effect. To understand these results, we fit a dynamic model, called the Multiattribute Linear Ballistic Accumulator model, to the choice and response time data. Modeling results reveal that presentation order influences the allocation of attention on the positive and negative differences between options. In sum, our results show that attention has a direct impact on the attraction effect.",>Jennifer Trueblood>Aneesha Dasari,">Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0636/index.html
2017,Interpretation and Processing Time of Generalized Quantifiers: Why your Mental Space Matters,"Generalized quantifiers (e.g., “most”) allow for fine-grained statements about quantities. The discrepancy in the underlying mental representation among interpreters can affect language use and reasoning. We investigated the effect of quantifier type, quantification space (set size) and monotonicity on processing difficulty and response diversity of 77 generalized quantifiers. Shannon entropy was employed to measure response diversity. Our findings indicate: (i) Set size is a significant factor of response diversity, which implies that the underlying space is relevant for the interpretation. (ii) Quantifiers possess a rather static underlying representation within and across tasks within a participant. (iii) Quantifier type and monotonicity can affect response diversity; while the response diversity can predict response time. (iv) In reasoning, the number of generalized quantifiers versus classical quantifiers in a syllogism is a factor of response diversity. Diversity in the interpretation of generalized quantifiers may be a cause of human’s deviation from logical responses.",>Alice Ping Ping Tse>Marco Ragni,>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0637/index.html
2017,Right hemisphere lateralization and holistic processing do not always go together: An ERP investigation of a training study,"Holistic processing (HP) and right-hemispheric lateralization both mark expertise in visual object recognition such as face and sub-ordinate object perception. However, counter-examples have been found recently: Experiences of selective-attention-to-parts such as writing experiences in Chinese characters reduced HP but increased right hemisphere lateralization. We investigated the association between HP and brain activities measured by event-related potentials (ERP) in participants trained to recognize artificially-created scripts using either whole-word or grapheme-to-phoneme approaches. Stronger N170 activities were found in both hemispheres in both training approaches. However, the two training approaches induced correlations in opposite directions between HP and the ERP signals in the right hemisphere: In the whole-word condition the HP effect increased, whereas in the grapheme-to-phoneme condition the HP effect decreased, with stronger right-hemispheric N170 activities. This demonstrates that HP and right hemispheric lateralization are separate processes that are likely associated with different perceptual mechanisms.",>Ricky Van-yip Tso>Hangyu Chen>Yui Andrew Yeung>Terry Kit-fong Au>Janet Hsiao,">1.

2017,“He’s pregnant”: simulating the confusing case of gender pronoun errors in L2,"Even advanced Spanish speakers of second language English tend to confuse the pronouns 'he' and 'she', often without even noticing their mistake (Lahoz, 1991). A study by Antón-Méndez (2010) has indicated that a possible reason for this error is the fact that Spanish is a pro-drop language. In order to test this hypothesis, we used an extension of Dual-path (Chang, 2002), a computational cognitive model of sentence production, to simulate two models of bilingual speech production of second language English. One model had Spanish (ES) as a native language, whereas the other learned a Spanish-like language that used the pronoun at all times (non-pro-drop Spanish, NPD_ES). When tested on L2 English sentences, the bilingual pro-drop Spanish model produced significantly more gender pronoun errors, confirming that pronoun dropping could indeed be responsible for the gender confusion in natural language use as well.",>Chara Tsoukala>Stefan Frank>Mirjam Broersma,">Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0639/index.html

2017,Extraneous visual noise facilitates word learning,"Variability is important to learning; however, whether it supports or hinders language acquisition is unclear. 3D object studies suggest that children learn words better when target objects vary, however storybook studies indicate that contextual variability impairs learning. We tested a dynamic systems account in which background variability should boost learning by speeding the emergence of new behaviors. Two groups of two-year-old children saw arrays of one novel and two known objects on a screen, and heard a novel or known label. Stimuli were identical across conditions, with the exception that in the constant condition objects appeared on a white background, and in the variable condition backgrounds were colored. Only children in the variable condition showed evidence of word learning, suggesting that extraneous variability supports learning by decontextualizing representations, and indicating that adding low-level entropy to the developmental system can trigger a change in behavior.",>Katherine Twomey>Lizhi Ma>Gert Westermann,">Lancaster University, UK>Lancaster University, UK>Lancaster University, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0641/index.html

Can changing task demands determine whether a spatial or non-spatial comparison processes is employed? Study displays of three colored shapes were presented, followed by test displays of three coloured shapes. Participants decided whether a feature changed between displays. Task-irrelevant changes to the probed item’s locations or feature bindings reduced memory performance, suggesting that participants employed spatially guided comparison process. This finding occurred irrespective of whether participants decided about the whole display, or only a single cued item within the display. When task-irrelevant feature changes occurred amongst uncued items, performance was unaffected by irrelevant changes in location or feature bindings. These results suggest that participants can flexibly shift comparison strategy in response to changing task demands. These findings have implications for models of VWM, which assume obligatory location-based comparisons in VWM.",>Rob Udale>Simon Farrell>Chris Kent,>University of Bristol>University of Western Australia>University of Bristol,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0642/index.html
2017,Weight matters: The role of physical weight in non-physical language across age and culture,"Languages commonly use physical properties to discuss non-physical states and events in the world. We investigate the degree to which human associations between physical properties and abstract concepts are culturally specific constructs. To do this, we tested three distinct populations---US adults, US children, and adults from an indigenous group in the lowlands of Bolivia, the Tsimane'---on their associations between the physical concept of weight, and a variety of abstract attributes (e.g., importance, emotional state, moral worth). We find a strong relationship between US and Tsimane' adults, but little-to-no relationship between US children and either adult population. This suggests that the concept of weight plays a similar role in everyday thought across cultures, but takes time to develop. We found that these associations could not be recovered from a simple semantic embedding analysis, suggesting that the cross-cultural connections between physical and abstract attributes may be learned through more than language alone.",>Tomer Ullman>Santiago Alonso-Diaz>Stephen Ferrigno>Sarina Zahid>Celeste Kidd,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0643/index.html

Participants performed a concurrent Simon task for three different durations (15, 30 and 45 seconds) which was followed by a time reproduction phase. Results revealed a main effect of social condition. Reproduction ratios in dual conditions were smaller than in the single condition and also smaller in the competitive condition compared to the cooperative condition.

For this study a modified version of the base rate task was used to induce conflict while measuring response times and judgements of confidence. The aim of this experiment was to determine the influence of different instruction conditions (reasoning according to belief or according to mathematical probability) on fluency and metacognitive judgements. As expected, participants experienced higher levels of conflict when reasoning according to mathematical probability even though conflict effects were present in both conditions. Additionally, higher believability items mitigated conflict influence while reasoning in accordance with belief and increased it when reasoning in accordance with mathematical probability.

We included four conditions in the experiment: text only, text and causal diagram, text and images and causal diagram only. Participants were checked for their recall of main ideas and causal sequences. Recall for main ideas did not vary significantly across conditions. Contrary to McCrudden et al., our results for the causal sequences revealed that participants who studied a causal diagram only could recall more steps from causal sequences than participants in any of the other conditions.

2017,The Role of Linguistic Information in Learning Abstract Words: Evidence from Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI),"Accounts of abstract word learning suggest that learning these words relies primarily on access to linguistic cues, such as the statistical co-occurrence of words with similar semantic properties. Thus, children with language impairment (LI), who by definition have impoverished access to linguistic context, should have disproportionate impairments in abstract word knowledge. Here, we compared verbal definitions and lexical decisions to both abstract and concrete words of children with LI (ages 8 to 13) and both age-matched and vocabulary-matched typically developing (TD) peers. Relative to age-matched peers, children with LI had significant deficits in both tasks. Crucially, however, there was not greater impairment of abstract words. We conclude that that linguistic knowledge is not a sine qua non to learning abstract words and concepts and other mechanisms, which are not specifically impaired in LI, are at play.",>Gabriella Vigliocco>Marta Ponari>Courtenay Norbury,>UCL>University of Kent>UCL,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0648/index.html

Although it is well known that infants ability to recognise people follows a developmental process, it is still an open question how face identity recognition skills can develop and, in particular, how facial expression and identity processing potentially interact during this developmental process. We propose that by acquiring information of the facial motor configuration observed from face stimuli encountered throughout development would be sufficient to develop a face-space representation. This representation encodes the observed face stimuli as points of a multidimensional psychological space able to assist facial identity and expression recognition. We validate our hypothesis through computational simulations and we suggest potential implications of this understanding with respect to the available findings in face processing.",>Jonathan Vitale>Benjamin Johnston>Mary-Anne Williams,>University of Technology Sydney>University of Technology Sydney>University of Technology Sydney,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0649/index.html

In most situations in which it finds itself, it has expectations as to what might happen. But when people’s expectations are invalidated by experience, the memories that gave rise to these expectations are suppressed. The present research explores the effect of these prediction errors on listener’s memories during social interaction. We reasoned that listening to a speaker recounting experiences similar to one’s own would trigger prediction errors on the part of the listener that would result in the suppression of his/her memories. Study 1 offers evidence for the effect of socially triggered context based prediction errors on listener’s mnemonic representations. Study 2 replicates these findings and shows that this effect is sensitive to a perspective-taking manipulation.

Consequently, personnel evaluation in companies and organizations requires assessing not only evaluating individual performance but also the overall direct and indirect effect one has on a team. Others’ work may be improved or hampered by the presence of a particular employee. We investigate Two-level Personnel-Evaluation Tasks (T-PETs) with information on individual and group earnings, where an individual focus may lead to evaluate the overall best employee as being the worst.

Here we focus on a scenario that is more ecologically valid with regard to different strategies for detecting workers who negatively interact with others (here ‘egoists’) and positive interactors (here ‘altruist’). The results on altruist detection in two-level personnel evaluation tasks (T-PETs), with information on individual and team performance, suggested a disregard of the team performance and a resulting “Tragedy of Personnel Evaluation”. Experiment 1 transfers the idea of altruist detection in a personnel evaluation and personnel selection task (von Sydow & Braus, 2016) to egoist detection and explores whether there are analogous problems for egoist detection.

Here we provide an overview of Bayesian logic (BL), as rational formulation of a pattern-based class of conjunction fallacies. BL is described here as a generalization of Bayesian Occam’s razor. BL captures the idea that probabilities are sometimes used not extensionally but intensionally, determining the probabilistic adequacy of ideal logical patterns. It is emphasized that BL a class of models, depending on representations and the meanings of logical connectives. We discuss open questions and limits of BL.

Human-Agent-Interaction can evoke any reaction, from complete rejection to great interest. But do humans implicitly regard virtual agents as pure machines, or beings on an anthropomorphic level? We asked participants to train an erroneous virtual agent on a cognitive task and to reward or punish it. The agent showed human-like emotional facial reactions for the experimental but not for the control group. We expected participants from the experimental group to give less harmful reinforcement and show more hesitation before punishing. Additionally, we hypothesised that participants with higher empathy show more compassion towards the agent and therefore would give more positive reinforcement and feel worse when punishing. The results indicate that the agent’s expression of emotionality is not the relevant factor for showing compassion towards it. Conversely, human empathy seems to be an important factor causing compassion for virtual agents.",>Laura Wächter>Barbara Kuhnert>Marco Ragni,>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0655/index.html
2017,Exploitative and Exploratory Attention in a Four-Armed Bandit Task,"When making decisions, we are often forced to choose between something safe we have chosen before, and something unknown to us that is inherently risky, but may provide a better long-term outcome. This problem is known as the Exploitation-Exploration (EE) Trade-Off. Most previous studies on the EE Trade-Off have relied on response data, leading to some ambiguity over whether uncertainty leads to true exploratory behavior, or whether the pattern of responding simply reflects a simpler ratio choice rule (such as the Matching Law or the Softmax Rule). Here, we argue that the study of this issue can be enriched by measuring changes in attention (via eye-gaze), with the potential to disambiguate these two accounts. We find that when moving from certainty into uncertainty, the overall level of attention to stimuli in the task increases; a finding we argue is outside of the scope of ratio choice rules.",>Adrian Walker>Mike Le Pelley>Tom Beesley,>UNSW Sydney>UNSW Sydney>UNSW Sydney,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0656/index.html

In this study, we used an online measure to look at the relationship between online parsing and the learning performance from the offline assessment of non-adjacent dependency learning.

Secondly, using basic functional circuits constructed a possible neural network for decision logic of animal’s behavior.

Extending this work, we measure the effect of prior exposure to the CRT in a sample of oil industry professionals. These engineers and geoscientists completed the CRT, seven bias tasks and rated their familiarity with all of these. Key results were that: familiarity increased CRT scores but tended not to reduce bias susceptibility; and industry personnel, even without prior CRT exposure, scored very highly on the CRT - greatly reducing its predictive power. Conclusions are that the standard CRT is not a useful tool for assessing bias susceptibility in highly numerate professionals – and doubly so when they have previously been exposed.",>Matthew Welsh>Steve Begg,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0659/index.html
2017,Desires influence 4- to 6-year-old children’s probabilistic judgments,"Research on wishful thinking suggests that desires bias adult’s probability judgments. Previous research has yet to explore if this extends to young children. In Experiment 1, 260 4- and 6-year-olds in the U.S. and Peru played a card game, where selecting a desirable card was unlikely. In Experiment 2, 200 4- to 6-year-old children were shown a bag of plastic eggs; a few contained desirable prizes. Children were asked to make predictions about what card / egg would be randomly selected. Answers were compared to control conditions in which probability was comparable, but children had no reason to desire a specific outcome. In control conditions, children tended to state that the majority card/ egg would be selected. In the experimental conditions, children were more likely to state that the desirable (and improbable) card/ egg would be selected. Results suggest that a desire bias extends to children as young as 4.",>Adrienne Wente>Mariel Goddu>Elyanah Posner>Teresa Garcia>María Fernández Flecha>Alison Gopnik,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0660/index.html
2017,The Interaction of Bayesian Pragmatics and Lexical Semantics in Linguistic Interpretation: Using Event-related Potentials to Investigate Hearers’ Probabilistic Predictions,"We contrast two views of how contextual influence on sentence meaning composition can be explained. The Semantic Similarity View maintains that discourse context affects sentence meaning mainly because of the semantic similarity between the words in the discourse context and the words in the sentence (as measured by Latent Semantic Analysis). The Free Pragmatic View, in contrast, defends the claim that also pragmatic aspects of the discourse context can affect sentence meaning composition. This effect can be quantitatively modelled by Bayesian Pragmatics. We introduce a Predictive Completion Task in which the hearer at every moment in a communicative situation has to generate a probabilistic prediction about how a discourse being uttered by the speaker is continued. We test the predictions of the two views in EEG using the well-established observation that the conditional probability of a word given a context is negatively correlated with the amplitude of its N400 component.",>Markus Werning>Erica Cosentino,>Ruhr University Bochum>Ruhr University Bochum,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0661/index.html
2017,The Neural Mechanisms of Relational Reasoning: Dissociating Representational Types,"The ability to reason about information is an essential human capability. It is less understood from the perspective of neuro-cognitive processes which can serve to constrain cognitive theories by implications from neuroscientific data. Despite some progress in the last decades, some disagreement about the experimental results and the cognitive processes of reasoning with abstract relations versus visuospatial relations persist. We conducted a cross-study meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies to determine the neural correlates of visuospatial and abstract relational reasoning. We analyzed 884 stereotactic data points from 38 studies and 692 subjects. We found that relational reasoning is mediated by the fronto-parietal network, especially the right precuneus and the left pars triangularis. Problems with abstract relations are processed by enhanced activation in the inferior parietal lobe, whereas visuospatial reasoning is promoted by prefrontal domains. Our results disentangle the neurocognitive mechanisms of different representational types of relational reasoning across study designs.",>Julia Wertheim>Marco Ragni,">University of Freiburg, Germany>University of Freiburg, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0662/index.html
2017,How the truth can make a great lie: An empirical investigation of the folk concept of lying by falsely implicating,"Is it possible to lie despite not saying something false? While the spontaneous answer seems to be ‘no’, there is some evidence from ordinary language that a lie does not require what is said to be false. In this paper, we will argue for a pragmatic extension of the standard definition of lying. More specifically, we will present three experiments which show that people’s concept of lying is not about the falsity of what is said, but about what is implied by saying it that way. We test the four Gricean conversational maxims. For each one of them we demonstrate that if a speaker implies something misleading, even by saying something semantically true, it is still considered lying.",>Alex Wiegmann>Pascale Willemsen,">University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany>Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0663/index.html

We examine this relationship between graphing and science by studying how students learn from interactive computer models with accompanying data graphs. The computer models provide an animated simulation that illustrates an unobservable phenomenon, while the data graph tracks one or more quantities over time. This ordering study, on middle school students learning about photosynthesis, indicates that engaging with novel graph concepts helped students interpret their data as they experimented with the computer model. The study also provided some support for the opposite direction: experimenting with the model first helped students make sense of the graphs.",>Eliane Wiese>Anna Rafferty>Marcia Linn,">University of California, Berkeley>Carleton University>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0664/index.html
2017,Counterfactual Conditionals and Normative Rules,"Counterfactual thinking is the consideration of how things could have turned out differently, usually taking the form of counterfactual conditionals. This experiment examined the psychological mechanisms that transform counterfactuals into deontic guidance rules for the future. We examined how counterfactual thinking translates into deontic guidance rules by asking participants to infer these deontic conclusions from the counterfactual premises. Participants were presented with a vignette and a counterfactual conditional, and assigned to either a control condition or a suppression condition in which they were additionally presented with conflicting normative rules. The presence of conflicting norms reduced the likelihood of positive deontic conclusions being endorsed and increased the likelihood of negative deontic conclusions being endorsed. Future intentionality and regret intensity ratings were reduced in the suppression condition. The same conditions that affect normative inference also affect regret and future planning, suggesting similar cognitive mechanisms underlie these processes.",>Meredith Wilkinson>Shira Elqayam>Valerie Thompson>David Over,">De Montfort University, United Kingdom>De Montfort University, Leicester, UK>Universify of Saskatchewan>Durham University, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0665/index.html
2017,Modality Differences in Timing: Testing the Pacemaker Speed Explanation,"A classic effect in the timing field is that “sounds are judged longer than lights” (Goldstone, Boardman & Lhamon, 1959). Recently, judgements for tactile durations have been found to fall between the two (Jones, Poliakoff & Wells, 2009). These modality differences are commonly interpreted within scalar timing theory as the work of a central pacemaker which runs faster for sounds, then vibrations, and slowest for lights (Wearden, Edwards, Fakhri & Percival, 1998). We investigated whether verbal estimates and temporal difference thresholds are correlated within each modality, but found this not to be the case. This suggests that differences in pacemaker speed may not be the main driver for modality differences in thresholds. In addition, we investigated sensory bias as an alternative to the pacemaker explanation, but this was found not to correlate with modality differences in timing.",>Emily Williams>Andrew Stewart>Luke Jones,>The University of Manchester>The University of Manchester>The University of Manchester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0666/index.html
2017,Modeling cognitive load effects in an interrupted learning task: An ACT-R approach,"Based on the established framework of Cognitive Load Theory, the presented research focuses on the inspection of cognitive load factors in an interrupted learning task. The task itself is inspired from basic cognitive research and demands participants to learn abstract symbol sequences of varying complexity. In addition, they have to deal with interruptions while performing the task. Experimental results indicate the influence of task complexity on how interruptions effect learning performance. However, questions on underlying learner cognition persist, rising the need for a more in-depth way of examination. For this purpose, a cognitive model within the cognitive architecture ACT-R is developed to clarify cognitive processes and mechanisms within different conditions of the task. Preliminary results from a first model for the easy task condition already indicate some fit between human and model data. Modeling work continues with adjusting the current model and implementing a model for the difficult task condition.",>Maria Wirzberger>Günter Daniel Rey>Josef F.

2017,Does Associative Memory Play a Role in Solving Physics Problems?,"Previous research has found that people frequently provide incorrect predictions about the path of moving objects when given an idealised physics problem to solve. The aim of this research was to explore whether these incorrect predictions are due to the application of an incorrect naïve physics theory, whether incorrect perceptions generated from past experiences lead to misconceptions of how moving objects behave, or whether it is a combination of both. Thirty-one participants volunteered to take part in the experiment which followed a two (experience congruent/incongruent with naïve physics theory) by two (carried versus free-moving object) within-subject design. The dependent variable was participant response (straight down or curved forwards). Results of the study revealed that participants provided answers both consistent and inconsistent with the naïve physics theory. This suggests that responses were primarily elicited through the retrieval of associatively-mediated memories of similar scenarios - some of which contain perceptual illusions.",>Katie Wood>Rossy McLaren>Ipl McLaren,>University of Exeter>University of Exeter>University of Exeter,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0668/index.html
2017,Sensorimotor Learning Modulates Automatic Imitation in Visual Speech,"People automatically imitate observed actions, including speech. Automatic Imitation (AI) is linked to observation-execution associations in the mirror neuron system (MNS). AI is measured using interference tasks, in which prompts (say ""ba"" or ""da"") are paired with congruent or incongruent distracters (video of someone saying ""ba"" or ""da""). Faster responses for congruent than for incongruent prompt-distracter pairings signal AI. Observation-execution associations for speech actions are thought to be inflexible, unlike associations for manual actions, which have been shown to be flexible. We trained participants to reinforce or abolish their AI response by providing them with compatible (say ""ba"" for a video of someone saying ""ba"") or incompatible training (say ""ba"" for a video of ""da""). After training, the AI response was reduced for participants who received incompatible training, thus showing that the MNS for speech actions is also flexible and subject to experience, like the MNS for manual actions.",>Yuchunzi Wu>Bronwen Evans>Patti Adank,">Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London, Chandler House, 2 Wakefield Street, London WC1N 1PF, UK>Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London, Chandler House, 2 Wakefield Street, London WC1N 1PF, UK>Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London, Chandler House, 2 Wakefield Street, London WC1N 1PF, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0669/index.html

Across two studies (including one pre-registered experiment), we used a preferential-looking task to find that infants as young as 12-17 months (mean: 14.8 months) successfully matched non-verbal vocalizations elicited by funny, exciting, adorable, sympathetic, and delicious images to their probable causes (Experiments 1 and 2). Do infants also posit unobserved causes of emotional expressions? In both exploratory and pre-registered experiments, an adult peeked into a box and made one of two distinct positive emotional vocalizations (Experiment 3: “Aww!” or “Mmm!”; Experiment 4: “Aww!” or “Whoa!”). Infants reaching into the box retrieved either a probable or improbable cause of the reaction. Infants were more likely to search again on incongruent trials.

To solve this challenge several different kinds of information about video clips are exploited. Traditional methods normally focused on single modality, either audio or visual. Later on some researchers tried to establish multi-modal schemes and spend a lot of time choosing and extracting features by different fusion strategy. In this research, we proposed an end-to-end model which can automatically extract features and target an emotional classification task by integrating audio and visual features together and also adding the temporal characteristics of the video. The experimental study on commonly used MediaEval 2015 Affective Impact of Movies has shown this method's potential and it is expected that this work could provide some insight for future video emotion recognition from feature fusion perspective.",>Siqi Xiang>Wenge Rong>Zhang Xiong>Min Gao>Qingyu Xiong,>Beihang University>Beihang University>Beihang University>Chongqing University>Chongqing University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0671/index.html
2017,Teaching Versus Active Learning: A Computational Analysis of Conditions that Affect Learning,"Researchers have debated whether instructional-based teaching or exploration-based active learning is better for decades with unsatisfying results. A main obstacle is the difficulty in precisely controlling and characterizing the pedagogical methods used and the learning conditions in empirical studies. To address this, we leveraged existing computational models of teaching and active learning to formalize the methods and the learning process. We compared the two pedagogical methods in a concept-learning framework and investigated their effectiveness under various scenarios. Our results show that when the learner and teacher are conceptually aligned, teaching is at least as effective as, and often much more effective than active learning, but when the alignment is broken, active learning can yield moderate improvement over teaching. We conclude by discussing our results' implications for the debate and the prospects of bringing computational models to bear on complex real-world problems that are resistant to simple experimental investigation.",>Scott Cheng-Hsin Yang>Patrick Shafto,>Rutgers University>Rutgers University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0672/index.html

Yet if we abandon classical (Bayesian) probability theory as an overarching framework for constructing cognitive models, what do we replace it with? In this contribution we outline a way to divide the space of possible computational level models of probabilistic judgment into a hierarchy of levels of increasing complexity, with classical Bayesian probability models occupying the lowest level.

2017,Evidence for overt visual attention to hand gestures as a function of redundancy and speech disfluency,"We investigated the effect of gesture redundancy and speech disfluency on listeners’ fixations to gestures. Participants watched a speaker producing a redundant or non-redundant gesture, while producing fluent or disfluent speech. Eye movements were recorded. Participants spent little time on a speaker’s gestures regardless of condition. Gesture redundancy and speech disfluency did not affect listeners’ percentage dwell time to a speaker’s gestures. However, listeners were more likely to fixate to a speaker’s gestures when they expected the gesture to be non-redundant. Listeners were also more likely to fixate to a speaker’s gestures when the speaker was disfluent. Thus, listeners allocate overt visual attention based on the expected usefulness of a speaker’s gestures, although evidence does not suggest that they spend more time fixating on these gestures. Furthermore, listeners are sensitive to disfluency in a speaker’s utterance and change how they attend to gestures based on qualities of the speech.",>Amelia Yeo>Martha Alibali,">University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States>University of Wisconsin - Madison, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0675/index.html

We recorded whether they used one hand or two hands to do so. In Experiment~2, we asked participants online to judge whether they think the person in the lab used one or two hands. We found a close correspondence between participants' actions in the lab, and the mental simulations of participants online. To explain participants' actions and mental simulations, we develop a model that plans over a symbolic representation of the situation, executes the plan using a geometric solver, and checks the plan's feasibility by taking into account the physical constraints of the scene.

2017,Three-Way Bindings in Associative Recognition,"To avoid interference among similar memory traces it is required to form complex memory structures that include multiple components of the event, which helps one to distinguish one event from another. In a laboratory setting, these complex binding structures have been studied through a paradigm where one has to form a memory structure that includes two items and the context together (i.e., three-way binding). However, despite the long history of the theoretical concept, its importance, and the existence of the laboratory paradigm, three-way binding structures have only been examined in recall paradigms. Moreover, not all memory models consider the ability to form three-way binding structures as a default. Therefore, the current study examined the use and formation of three-way binding structures in an associative recognition paradigm. Results provide evidence that three-way binding structures are used during recognition, which implies that it is critical for memory models to properly represent them.",>Hyungwook Yim>Adam Osth>Vladimir Sloutsky>Simon Dennis,>The University of Newcastle>The University of Melbourne>The Ohio State University>The University of Newcastle,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0677/index.html
2017,Emotional and Cognitive Interest: How Creating Situational Interest Affects Learning With Multimedia,"Situational interest is the positive affect and sustained attention triggered by particular contexts (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). Some studies show interesting information enhances learning while others find it hinders learning, producing the seductive detail effect. Limited evidence suggests the seductive detail effect is weakened if emotionally interesting information is relevant to main ideas. The present research shows the seductive detail effect occurs only under certain conditions. Harp and Mayer (1997) proposed that generating cognitive, rather than emotional, interest is more effective for improving learning by cueing relationships among concepts for easier processing. Hidi and Renninger (2006) argue distinguishing between the emotional and cognitive might be artificial. Present research found benefits from cognitive interest but no support as to whether cognitive interest is necessarily a distinct type of interest from emotional interest.

2017,"“I won’t lie, it wasn’t amazing”: Modeling polite indirect speech","Why are we polite when we talk to one another? One hypothesis is that people expect others to choose what to say based on their goals both to transfer information efficiently (an epistemic goal) and to make the listener feel good (a social goal). In our previous work, we found that when these two goals conflict, they sometimes produce white lies. In the current work, we expand on this theory to consider another prominent case of polite speech: indirect remarks using negation (e.g., ""It wasn't amazing""). With minimal extensions from our previous framework, our formal model suggests that a pragmatic speaker will produce more indirect remarks when the speaker wants to be informative and seem considerate at the same time. These predictions were borne out in a language production experiment. These findings suggest that the conflict between social and epistemic goals can account for a broad range of politeness phenomena.",>Erica Yoon>Michael Henry Tessler>Noah Goodman>Michael Frank,">Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0679/index.html

In this study, we examined how people process repetition and alternation in binary sequences. Across four paradigms involving estimation, working memory, change detection, and visual search, we found that the number of alternations is under-estimated compared to repetitions (Experiment 1). Moreover, recall for binary sequences deteriorates as the sequence alternates more (Experiment 2). Changes in bits are also harder to detect as the sequence alternates more (Experiment 3). Finally, visual targets superimposed on bits of a binary sequence take longer to process as alternation increases (Experiment 4). Overall, our results indicate that compared to repetition, alternation in a binary sequence is less salient in the sense of requiring more attention for successful encoding. The current study thus reveals the cognitive constraints in the representation of alternation and provides a new explanation for the over-alternation bias in randomness perception.",>Ru Qi Yu>Daniel Osherson>Jiaying Zhao,">Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia>Department of Psychology, Princeton University>Department of Psychology; Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, University of British Columbia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0681/index.html

However, previous models either lack a learning component or use limited, artificial data for simulations. To address these issues, we build a domain-general neural network model that learns to solve analogy tasks in different modalities, e.g., texts and images. Importantly, it uses word representations and image representations computed from large-scale naturalistic corpus. The model reproduces several key findings in the analogical reasoning literature, including relational shift and familiarity effect, and demonstrates domain-general learning capacity. Our model also makes interesting predictions on cross-modality transfer of analogical reasoning that could be empirically tested. Our model makes the first step towards a computational framework that is able to learn analogy tasks using naturalistic data and transfer to other modalities.",>Arianna Yuan,">Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0683/index.html
2017,Convincing Conversations: Using a Computer-Based Dialogue System to Promote a Plant-Based Diet,"In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a computer-based persuasive dialogue system designed to promote a plant-based diet. The production and consumption of meat and dairy has been shown to be a major cause of climate change and a threat to public health, bio-diversity, animal rights and human rights. A system promoting plant-based diets was developed, comprising conversational, motivational and argumentational elements. 280 participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions, each representing a particular combination of motivational and argumentational modules. Male participants showed higher intention scores in the motivational conditions compared to the argumentation-only or control condition. Female participants scored higher overall, unaffected by condition. These results suggest that men and women are differentially sensitive to persuasive strategies regarding the adoption of a plant-based diet.

Most research supports the hypothesis that hemispheric lateralization is the main reason for the persistent leftward bias in spatial tasks. Findings on the influence of reading direction, handedness and participant age are largely contradictory. As a result of brain maturation adults usually perform with significant leftward bias. However, both hemispheric activation and scanning habits exert an influence on space representation, which varies across age groups. Preschoolers, prepuberty children and adults were tested on the line and word bisection tasks and on house-person-tree drawing tasks.

Research on color-temperature correspondence and their interaction is quite scarce, and based mostly on subjective measures. It is still unknown whether and to what extent colors bear the thermal information. The current study explored the relationship between warm and cold colors (red and blue) and thermal aspects of the word semantics (sun, snow), using the Stroop paradigm in a color categorization task. It was hypothesized that if colors activate the thermal meaning then Stroop effect should occur. The results suggested a color-temperature compatibility effect – faster responses when associated color and thermal meaning corresponded (e.g. sun presented in red). This provides important information on the automaticity of thermal activation during word processing, and on the strength of conceptual associations in color perception. It was suggested that words induced mental simulation of the thermal concepts, together with the associated color.",>Yordanka Zafirova>Armina Janyan,">Department of Cognitive Science and Psychology, New Bulgarian University, Bulgaria>Research Center for Cognitive Science, New Bulgarian University, Bulgaria",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0686/index.html

However, this perspective fails to explain recent findings that suggest learning about a blocked cue is superior to a different type of redundant cue. We report an experiment designed to test the proposal that blocking is not a failure of association, but a performance effect arising from a comparator process (Denniston, Savastano, & Miller, 2001). Participants received A+ AX+ BY+ CY- training containing a blocked cue X and another redundant cue Y, before rating outcome expectancies for individual cues. These ratings were inconsistent with the association-failure view. After subsequent A- Y+ training, participants rated cues again. Ratings in the second test were inconsistent with the comparator theory. Our data suggest that neither perspective is likely to provide a complete account of causal learning.",>Tara Zaksaite>Peter M.

Recent work has suggested that a censored random walk on a semantic network resembles semantic fluency data because it produces optimal foraging. However, fluency data have rich structure beyond being consistent with optimal foraging. Under the assumption that memory can be represented as a semantic network, we test a variety of memory search processes and examine how well these processes capture the richness of fluency data. The search processes we explore vary in the extent they explore the network globally or exploit local clusters, and whether they are strategic. We found that a censored random walk with a priming component best captures the frequency and clustering effects seen in human fluency data.",>Jeffrey C. Zemla>Joseph L.

Our overall results showed that there were significant different impacts of the decision agency and granularity between High and Low students on learning performance. More specifically, for High students step level decisions can be more effective than problem level decisions; for Low students, they learned significantly better when they were making problem-level decisions than making step-level decisions, but no significant difference was not found when the decisions were made by the tutor. To our surprise, both High and Low groups showed strong decision-making preference for problem solving over worked example.",>Guojing Zhou>Min Chi,">North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States>North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0689/index.html
2017,Information Seeking as Chasing Anticipated Prediction Errors,"When faced with delayed, uncertain rewards, humans and other animals usually prefer to know the eventual outcomes in advance. This preference for cues providing advance information can lead to seemingly suboptimal choices, where less reward is preferred over more reward. Here, we introduce a reinforcement-learning model of this behavior, the anticipated prediction error (APE) model, based on the idea that prediction errors themselves can be rewarding. As a result, animals will sometimes pick options that yield large prediction errors, even when the expected rewards are smaller. We compare the APE model against an alternative information-bonus model, where information itself is viewed as rewarding. These models are evaluated against a newly collected dataset with human participants. The APE model fits the data as well or better than the other models. These results suggest that anticipated prediction errors can be an important signal underpinning decision making.",>Jian-Qiao Zhu>Wendi Xiang>Elliot Ludvig,">University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom>University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom>University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0690/index.html

2017,Simulation and heuristics in flexible tool use,"Humans are remarkably flexible tool users. We not only recognize a wide range of existing tools, but also produce new tools by seeing objects in new ways, or by making or repurposing objects to solve a problem confronting us. Here we study the cognitive processes supporting flexible tool use, including deciding what makes a good tool, and how it should be used. Participants played a video game which requires selecting an object from a set of options and placing it in a virtual physical scene in order to accomplish goals such as tipping another object over or launching it into a container. People appear to use a combination of simulation-based planning and experience-based heuristics: fast heuristics drive the initial selection and placement of a candidate tool, and that solution can then be refined by several rounds of mental simulation interspersed with trial-and-error experimentation to rapidly converge on goal-satisfying solutions.",>Kelsey Allen>Kevin Smith>Josh Tenenbaum,">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, US>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0692/index.html
2017,Predicting Preschool-Aged Children’s Behavior Regulation from Attention Tasks in the Lab,"One challenge in studying cognition over the lifespan is designing tasks that measure the same construct in different age groups and relate reliably to real-world outcomes. The current study confronts this challenge by testing a new paradigm to assess attention in preschool-aged children for comparison with other measures. Children completed the new “Pop-the-Bubbles” paradigm plus Flanker and Visual Search tasks, for comparison with parental reports of behavioral regulation. Correlations between behavioral regulation and measures from both Flanker and Pop-the-Bubbles suggest that children’s ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli in these lab tasks relates to their ability to behave appropriately in everyday situations. Further development of Pop-the-Bubbles for eye-tracking and a color version of Flanker are underway to test these relationships more extensively in young children.",>Chelsea Andrews>Emily Coates>Kristine Kovack-Lesh>Vanessa Simmering,>University of Wisconsin Madison>Ripon College>Ripon College>University of Wisconsin - Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0693/index.html
2017,Why do we punish negligent behaviors?,"Prior research suggests that negligent harms are punished because of the resulting negative outcomes. Under this account, negligent but completely harmless acts should not be punished. An alternative possibility is that negligence is punished as a way of modifying future thought and behavior. Across three studies we find support for this second proposal. Study 1 demonstrates that punishment is assigned to negligent agents, irrespective of whether or not a harm actually occurs. Study 2 demonstrates that non-negligent agents who cause harm are punished less than negligent agents who do not cause harm. Study 3 shows that the punishment of harmful negligent actions is only judged to be successful when it results in the agent ceasing to act negligently, and not when it results in the harm ceasing to occur. Together, these results suggest that a primary function of punishment in cases of negligence is modify future thought.",>Sarin Arunima>Cushman Fiery,>Harvard University>Harvard University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0694/index.html
2017,"When I say ‘Black Lives Matter,’ why do some people hear ‘Others Lives Matter Less’?","The statement ""Black lives matter"" is commonly construed as implying other lives matter less, even though the statement does not explicitly reference other lives. Bias is a common explanation for this construal. However, other factors may contribute. We hypothesized that the linguistic structure of “Black lives matter” plays an important role. ""Black lives matter"" takes the form of a generic, or statements in which a property is attributed to members of a set (e.g., “lions have manes”). Generics are often interpreted as implicit comparisons (e.g., “lions are more likely to have manes than other animals”). We report two experiments in which we find evidence that the statement “Black lives matter” is often construed as an implicit comparative claim, similarly to other generics. This research contributes to our understanding of generics, while providing a novel explanation for why when I say ""Black lives matter,"" some people hear ""Other lives matter less.""",>E.

2017,The Use of Ambiguous Messages as a Strategy to Appeal to Multiple Decision Makers,"Messages that are tailored to specific audiences (matched messages) are typically more persuasive compared to messages that are crafted for a general audience (Hirsh, Kang, & Bodenhauser, 2012). However, tailoring messages can have the effect that messages are less persuasive for audiences for which they were not tailored (mismatched messages; Sillince, Jarzabkowski, & Shaw, 2012). Eisenberg (1984) introduced the concept of strategic ambiguity to appeal to multiple audiences simultaneously. We systematically compared effects of matched/mismatched tailored messages with the effects of ambiguous messages on multiple-criteria choice behavior. We found evidence that ambiguous messages can be used under certain conditions to simultaneously appeal to multiple audiences within the context of credit card choices. Using the financial control typology developed by Shefrin and Nicols (2014) to define different audiences, the study (154 participants) provided some support for the use of ambiguity as a tool for tailoring messages to diverse credit-card holders.",>Devika Banerji>Torsten Reimer>Chris Roland,">Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States>Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States>Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0696/index.html

This experiment investigated differences in wayfinding decisions between individuals and groups and their dependence on environmental structure. Participants navigated through a train station with or without market stalls, either as individuals or as groups. There was a significant main effect of environmental structure on task efficiency, and an inconclusive interaction between environmental structure and group membership on task efficiency (p=0.05). Because of heterogeneity of variance, we conducted targeted t-tests. T-tests revealed that groups were slower than individuals with market stalls (p=0.02) but not without (p=0.91). There was significant main effect of the environmental structure on number of turns. The main effect of group membership on number of turns and the interaction were not significant.

2017,Projecting space into the future: peripersonal space remaps in anticipation of an object manipulation,"Manipulation planning relies on anticipatory processes, aimed at achieving the desired goal state, such as a grasp. This implies that peripersonal space is remapped to the anticipated grasp posture on the targeted object. Vibrotactile-visual interactions were probed at different times during a grasp-and-place task. Thumb or index finger were stimulated concurrently with a visual distractor on the to-be-grasped object. Object orientation (upright/upside down) afforded a thumb-up or thumb-down grasp, inverting the congruency between haptic and visual stimulation. Response times about which finger was stimulated show the expected crossmodal congruency effect already before motion onset, with shorter times when the visual distractor and the future position of the stimulated finger overlapped. Moreover, eye-tracking data show that the tactile stimulation influences the gaze in anticipation of the upcoming grasp. Thus peripersonal hand space is mapped into the future, predictively mediating between tactile and visual perceptions as a function of the final state.",>Anna Belardinelli>Johannes Lohmann>Martin Butz,>University of Tübingen>University of Tübingen>University of Tübingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0698/index.html

Such a conceptualization means: (1) the human and machine agents have a common goal or mission; (2) each agent may have different subtasks within the goal space; (3) they do not have a shared memory, but (4) they do have a means of communicating with each other. Process algebras, such as communicating sequential processes (Hoare, 1977), are formal languages for describing the ways in which two concurrent processes interact through message passing across information channels. In this research, we enumerate the ways in which human-machine interactions can be structured, such as strictly serial, parallel, and cascade-like architectures. We use process algebras to characterize the interactions in candidate architectures.

2017,Bottom-up attentional cueing in category learning in children,"Young children tend to differ from adults in how they learn new categories. In comparison to adults (who rely on selective attention and tend to form explicit rules), children distribute attention widely, forming similarity-based category representations. But, when attention is explicitly directed toward the rule with top-down feedback, children exhibit rule-based classification--though memory performance still indicates distributed attention. Little is known, however, how bottom-up attentional cueing affects the category representations that children form. In our experiment 4-year-olds learned to classify alien creatures composed of binary features. A single “deterministic” feature perfectly predicted category membership, while other features were probabilistically predictive. We manipulated the saliency of the deterministic feature, making it grow and shrink. This manipulation was remarkably effective at facilitating category learning and rule-based classification, but recognition memory still showed evidence of distributed attention. These results help elucidate the important role of attentional processes in the development of categorization.",>Nathaniel Blanco>Vladimir Sloutsky,>Ohio State University>Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0700/index.html

Control instructors did not receive PD or CS materials. In both experimental and control classes, CS knowledge was measured at the beginning and end of the semester; we also collected lesson plans where teacher-candidates explained their reasoning for each instructional decision. We saw no CS knowledge improvement, but teacher-candidates exposed to CS reduced their use of folk reasons (e.g., buzz words such as learning styles, concrete thinking, active learning, etc.) when planning lessons compared with peers in control classes.",>Julie Booth,>Temple University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0701/index.html
2017,Using Analogical Processing to Categorize Musical Patterns,"Participants often categorize musical melodies (“themes”) based on perceptual features (e.g. loudness, fastness) instead of structural or relational features (e.g. pitch, rhythm) (Lamont & Dibben, 2001; Ziv & Eitan, 2007). In the present study, we investigate whether within-category analogical comparison (Markman & Gentner, 1993) influences participants to categorize musical themes based on relational features, a prediction from structure-mapping theory (Gentner, 1983). Participants completed a forced-choice triad task where they had to choose whether one theme (relational match) or another (perceptual match) best fit the target theme. In a “no-compare” condition (between-subjects), participants heard one target theme. In a “compare” condition, participants heard and compared two target themes. Initial results indicate that participants who compared two themes chose more relational matches. We found this result for Western Classical themes and popular music chord progressions.

What if the context renders verb-predicate and noun-object interpretations equally plausible? We examined 14-15-month-olds’ capacity for linking semantic elements of scenes with simple bisyllabic nonce utterances. Each syllable either referred to the object, or the object’s motion. Infants heard the syllables in either a VS- or SV-consistent order. Learning was tested using 2AFC language-guided looking. Infants learned the nouns and verbs equally well, showing no bias favoring nouns. In all conditions, infants learned the meaning of the utterance-final syllable, but not the initial one, suggesting that noun or verb biases played a smaller role than utterance position when noun- and verb-learning were equally supported by context.",>Angelica Buerkin-Pontrelli>Daniel Swingley,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0703/index.html
2017,No Tranfer of Training in Simple Addition,"Several researchers have proposed that skilled adults may solve single-digit addition problems (e.g. 3+1=4, 4+3=7) using a fast counting procedure. Practicing a procedure often leads to transfer of learning and faster performance of unpracticed items. Such transfer has been demonstrated using a counting-based alphabet arithmetic task (e.g., B+4 = C D E F) that indicated robust RT gains when untrained transfer problems at test had been implicitly practiced (e.g., practice B+3, test B+2 or B+1). Here we constructed analogous simple addition problems (practice 4+3, test 4+2 or 4+1). In three experiments (n=108) there was no evidence of generalization for these items, but there was robust speed up when the items were repeated. The results are consistent with direct retrieval of addition facts from long-term memory rather than a counting procedure.",>Jamie Campbell>Yalin Chen,">University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada>University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0704/index.html
2017,Vowel Harmony as a Distributional Learning Problem,"Vowel harmony is a class of phonotactic restrictions in which vowels in a language are divided into two or more subclasses, and words must contain only vowels from only one such subclass regardless of intervening consonants. Languages worldwide (Turkish, Finnish, Mongolian, Warlpiri, but not English) exhibit vowel harmony. The opacity of such potentially long distance alternations poses a challenge for the learner. Nevertheless, infants are sensitive to vowel harmony alternations at as young as seven months. We present a computational model for vowel harmony acquisition. By normalizing transitional probabilities over the vowel tier, and making minimal assumptions about the phonology, we successfully determine which test languages have harmony processes and correctly categorize their vowels into harmonizing classes. Using universal typological patterns to inform the search space, we find that phenomena which appear opaque can be captured by simple distributional learning.",>Spencer Caplan>Jordan Kodner,">University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States>University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0705/index.html

This poster will compare the results of document classification using the word2vec skipgram model and the 20k sensorimotor word norms collected by the presenter and colleagues (Lynott & Connell 2013; Carney et al., in prep.) (These latter norms establish how concepts are processed by way of perceptual and motor schemes, and thus offer a useful proxy for human conceptual classification.) The results of the comparison will generate insights into the different ways in which higher-order concepts are inferred, and allow systematic biases in concept formation to be identified. It will also allow for machine learning processes to be finessed so as to more accurately reflect human-level modes of cognition.",>James Carney,">Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, Lancashire, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0706/index.html
2017,Mapping hand to world; Development of iconic representation in gesture and homesign,"In both gesture and sign, objects and events can be represented by reproducing some of their features iconically. Iconic gestures do not typically appear until well into children’s second year of life, suggesting that the cognitive and/or communicative resources required are not trivial. Here we investigate how manual iconicity develops in two different communicative systems. Using longitudinal video corpora, we compare the emergence of manual iconicity in 52 hearing children learning a spoken language (co-speech gesture) to a deaf child creating a manual communication system (homesign). We focus on the shape of the hand, asking how handshape use changes between age 1 and 5, and how handshape choice relates to semantic content. We find broadly similar patterns of handshape development in co-speech gesture and homesign. This suggests that the cognitive building blocks underlying children's ability to iconically map forms to meanings are shared across vastly different communicative systems.",>Erica Cartmill>Lilia Rissman>Miriam Novack>Susan Goldin-Meadow,>University of California Los Angeles>University of Chicago>Northwestern University>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0707/index.html

The overall accuracy was .47 with no effect of constraint or frequency. When the data were limited to those words the learners reported having no prior encounters with and those sentences they reported comprehending, the accuracy was .45.

2017,Comparing Human Use of Fast & Frugal Tree with Machine-Learning Tree,"Previous studies have shown that the predictive accuracy of fast and frugal decision trees (FFTs) is comparable to decision trees generated by machine-learning (Martignon et al., 2008). FFTs are thought to be useful decision tools that are cognitively plausible to internalise, as opposed to complex machine-learning algorithms. Nonetheless, there seems to be a lack of behavioural studies in the literature to support such a claim. In this between-group experiment, we examined the human use of an FFT versus a C4.5 algorithm tree when completing a car evaluation task. Participants had to learn the rules of their given tree before making evaluations based on their memory. Preliminary results show that FFTs may indeed be easier to use, even when the number of cues for both trees are the same. Interestingly, participants who were successful in using the C4.5 tree exhibited tree pruning strategies, resulting in a heuristic similar to an FFT.",>Yee Siang Chng,">UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, LONDON, LONDON, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0709/index.html
2017,Incorrect responses salience affects strategy use in a figural analogy task,"Previous studies of multiple-choice analogy problems suggested that some people use a more efficient but also harder constructive strategy (they build the complete representation of analogy), whereas others tend to use a less effective but simpler response elimination. We tested whether salience of incorrect options (five per figural analogy problem) affected strategy use. Salient options in 18 problems missed many features from the (sixth) correct option; options in 18 non-salient problems missed only few features. When controlling for working memory capacity, eye tracking yielded strongly correlating patterns of data that suggested, in line with previous reports, large individual variance in strategy use. However, participants overall spent 50% less time analyzing salient than non-salient options, suggesting that salience promoted the constructive strategy. This conclusion was supported by pupil size significantly predicting accuracy on problems with salient options, but not on those with non-salient options (which additionally yielded lower accuracy).",>Iwona Ciechanowska>Bartlomiej Kroczek>Adam Chuderski,">Jagiellonian University, Krakow>Jagiellonian University, Krakow>Jagiellonian University, Krakow",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0710/index.html
2017,Learning Object Names from Visual Pervasiveness: the Visual Statistics Predict,"Recent analysis of a corpus of infant-perspective head-camera images found an extremely right-skewed frequency distribution of objects present in 8- to 10-month-old infants’ visual environments (Clerkin, et al., 2017). Furthermore, the objects most pervasively present in these scenes have names normatively acquired first by learners of English. New analyses show that the names for these objects occur only sparsely in infants’ environments, and object name frequency is not correlated with object visual frequency. Therefore, we designed a simple associative model simulating word-object co-occurrence in order to investigate how visual pervasiveness without high-frequency naming could lead to learning of word-object correspondences. With random sampling from distributions reflecting the actual frequency of words and objects in infants’ environments, we find that the most frequent objects have a distinct advantage over less frequent objects in their conditional probability. This suggests visual experience with objects may be the principal predictor of early word-referent learning.",>Elizabeth Clerkin>Chen Yu>Linda Smith,">Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States>Indiana University>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0711/index.html

In biology, intuitive thinking can be characterized in terms of cognitive construals (anthropocentric, teleological, and essentialist thinking, Coley & Tanner, 2015). We examined relations between intuitive thinking and biological misconceptions, and how formal biology education might influence such relations. 137 biology and non-science majors completed measures of anthropocentric, teleological, and essentialist thinking, and indicated agreement/disagreement with common misconceptions and explained their responses. Teleological thinking (but not anthropocentric or essentialist thinking) predicted teleological misconceptions. Anthropocentric and teleological thinking (but not essentialist thinking) predicted anthropocentric misconceptions. Agreement with essentialist misconceptions was unrelated to intuitive thinking. Similar patterns for non-majors and majors suggests formal biology education may have little influence on relations between intuitive reasoning and misconceptions.

2017,A picture falls under many categories: How ancient mathematical marks became extinct,"The development of mathematical marking conventions from prehistory to the present is characterized by a trend from conventions with more iconic relationships to concrete structures of the physical world (such as more pictorial ancient land surveying marks) to marking systems with less-iconic relationships to physical structures (that represent numbers, operations, infinity, and other more abstract concepts). We propose how certain constraints of perception-cognition induced conventions that made more-iconic (pictorial) marks controversial. These became too conceptually ambiguous to convey more abstract conceptual categories during the formalization of mathematics: Iconic properties of ancient proto-mathematical conventions recruited lower level perceptual capabilities developed to perceive-act in a concrete world of occluded surfaces-edges and were suitable for conveying concrete structures (such as landforms during surveying). However, these were too conceptually ambiguous to convey more abstract conceptual categories that emerged when mathematics was formalized because a (pictured) concrete structure can fall under many possible conceptual categories",>Peter Coppin>Daemon Retren>Ambrose Li,">Perceptual Artifacts Lab, Faculty of Design, OCAD University and the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto>Perceptual Artifacts Lab, Faculty of Design, OCAD University>Perceptual Artifacts Lab, OCAD University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0713/index.html
2017,ANCHORING is amodal: evidence from a signed language.,"Modern linguistic theory posits the existence of universal constraints. But whether these constraints concern language structure, generally, or speech, specifically, is unknown. To address this question, here we ask whether the constraints identified in spoken languages transfer to sign languages. ANCHORING (McCarthy & Prince, 1993) is a putatively universal constraint on reduplication. ANCHORING requires that the final element of a suffixed reduplicant match the final element of the base (e.g., pana ‘chase’––>panana, ‘run’ not panapa). Here, we examine whether ANCHORING is likewise operative in a signed language. In our experiments, native ASL signers rated novel reduplicated forms: either ones consistent or inconsistent with ANCHORING (i.e., ABB vs. ABA, where A and B are syllables). Results showed that signers reliably favored ABB forms over ABA. These findings show for the first time that ANCHORING constrains a sign language. This conclusion is consistent with the existence of amodal linguistic principles.",>Qatherine Dana>Diane Brentari>Outi Bat-El>Iris Berent,">Dep. of Psychology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, United States>Dep. of Linguistics, University of Chicago>Dep. of Linguistics, Tel-Aviv University>Dep. of Psychology, Northeastern University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0714/index.html

Specifically, we measured proactive and retroactive interference effects in children and adults when learning multiple sets of contingencies, as well as individuals’ memory binding for the same contingencies. We measured proactive interference by examining memory for a second set of contingencies after learning a first set, and retroactive interference by examining memory for the first set of contingencies after learning the second set. We measured memory binding by presenting participants with partial information about each contingency and measuring their accuracy and pattern of errors when asked to identify the completed contingency. Results indicate that both children and adults experienced substantial interference effects, but children were more prone to interference and substantially worse at memory binding. Additionally, individuals’ memory binding abilities were predictive of the magnitude of interference effects, suggesting that memory binding is an important mechanism modulating memory interference.",>Kevin Darby>Vladimir Sloutsky,">The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0715/index.html
2017,Developmental Changes in Visual Scene Statistics,"Mature visual experience is tuned by inputs to the developing visual system. However, little is known about the low-level statistics of available visual input as infants interact with the world in rapidly changing ways. Recent studies of the contents of infant-perspective scenes (sampled from a corpus of over 5 million head camera images) indicate that these contents change dramatically over the first year of life. Faces, ceilings, wall edges, and high-contrast patterns characterize younger babies (below 3 months), while more crowded images characterize older babies. These differences suggest possible developmental changes in lower-level visual statistics. After analyzing a sample of infant-perspective scenes from 4- to 10-week-old infants, and from 28- to 34-week-old infants, we found that mean Feature Congestion and Subband Entropy—measures of visual clutter in natural scenes—increase with age.

Enriched adjectives (“real/fake”) highlighted or adjusted the noun’s meaning, whereas non-enriched adjectives (“white/flawed”) simply specified a property. Adjectives had positive (“white/real”) or negative polarity (“flawed/fake”). Upon the display of critical NPs, participants indicated by a series of key presses if the sentence was correct. For the SAT response function we computed the (i) asymptote (response accuracy as d’), (ii) rate (response speed) and (iii) intercept (point when accuracy departs from chance). Accuracy was significantly lower for semantically enriched vs. non-enriched NPs, suggesting that highlighting and adjusting certain properties during composition is costly. Polarity affected temporal dynamics with negative NPs showing a slower rate than positive NPs, indicating that negative information is processed in more depth.",>Diana Dimitrova>Brian McElree>Petra Schumacher,">University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany>New York University, New York City, USA>University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0717/index.html
2017,A Neurodynamical Model of How Prior Knowledge Influences Visual Perception,"Recent behavioral studies showed that prior knowledge can directly influence visual perception. In the current work, we offer an explanation of the observed findings based on the adaptive resonance theory (ART). The ART neural network was designed to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting during learning in non-stationary environment. In the ART, stability of learning is achieved by matching bottom-up sensory signals with top-down expectations. Resonant state that corresponds with conscious perception develops in the network when the bottom-up and top-down signals are closely aligned. On the other hand, mismatch produces global reset signal that clears the traces of erroneous top-down expectations. Therefore, prior knowledge can influence conscious perception only when it already closely matches with sensory signals. We performed computer simulations with real-time implementation of the ART circuit that confirm our analysis. Simulations also showed how observed behavioral findings arise from response bias.",>Dražen Domijan>Mateja Marić,>University of Rijeka>University of Rijeka,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0718/index.html
2017,Couples Emotion Dynamics During Conversations Involving Stress and Enjoyment,"While conversing face-to-face, romantic partners are thought to form a coupled and co-regulatory system, unintentionally shaping each other's emotional states on a moment-by-moment basis. What has been less explored, however, are the ways in which this coupling is modulated by high-level interpersonal factors, such as discussing topics that are stressful for one or both partners. We provide an initial exploration by examining the emotion ratings of 42 romantic, heterosexual couples during conversations involving stress or enjoyment. Ratings were generated via continuous dials (sampled every second) as participants watched video playback of their interactions. The resulting time series were assessed for time-lagged patterns of emotional coupling using cross recurrence quantification analysis. Initial results show that for topics that involved a mutual sense of stress or enjoyment, overall coupling was high, but this coupling was largely disrupted once the stress was more asymmetrically experienced.",>Nicholas Duran>Ashley Randall,>Arizona State University>Arizona State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0719/index.html
2017,Information Signatures in Children’s Language Environment,"In auditory statistical learning, children are sensitive to the transitional structure of their language environment. Variability and stability of utterances in the language environment are important properties of statistical learning but are currently understudied across laboratory and naturalistic research contexts. In this study, we quantify variability and stability in the language environment of children as measured by amount of information within the temporal structure of caregivers’ utterances. In this work we present a new method for understanding information signatures in the temporal structure of parent-child free play contexts and document information signatures of caregiver utterances at multiple timescales. Our results suggest information signatures of parental utterances increase across development (9-24 months), but decrease within individual play sessions (5-6 minutes). We speculate that the dynamics of information signatures varies across multiple timescales. Possible implications of the observed information signatures inherent in caregivers’ naming of objects to their young children are explored.",>Steven L. Elmlinger>Drew H. Abney>David W.

2017,The acquisition of verb morphology in Polish and Finnish: Model and experiment,"Usage-based approaches suggest that language acquisition is a function of the statistical properties of the input. We compare predictions from neural network models with results of two elicited-production experiments on verb inflection with children in the morphologically complex languages Polish and Finnish. Three-layer neural networks were trained to produce person/number-inflected present-tense verb forms in Polish and Finnish from phoneme representations of verb stems using frequency information from child-directed speech corpora. Simulated acquisition in both languages was affected by token frequency and phonological neighbourhood density (PND) as well as an interaction such that low-frequency forms benefited more from PND than high-frequency forms. Suffix errors showed overgeneralisation and substitutions of low-frequency forms with higher-frequency forms. The model predictions are consistent with our empirical findings, except for the frequency X PND interaction. We discuss the experimental and simulated data and their implications.",>Felix Engelmann>Joanna Kolak>Sonia Granlund>Ben Ambridge>Julian Pine>Anna Theakston>Elena Lieven,">University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom>University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom>University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom>University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom>University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom>University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom>University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0721/index.html
2017,What makes a joke funny: Analysing joke humor through single-word ratings.,"The appreciation of humor is a universal phenomenon and a key aspect of cognition. It has been studied in the context of jokes, where the incongruity in expected and observed context results in the perception of humor. The present study examines how the humor appreciation of single words relates to the humor of the whole joke – is a joke simply a sum of its parts? Using a novel dataset of single-word humor ratings, collections of jokes from the JESTER database were analyzed. A multiple regression analysis showed joke length and individual word arousal were the best predictors of joke funniness. Longer jokes with fewer individually arousing words were found funnier. Individual word humor did not contribute to the humor of the overall joke. These findings suggest the cognitive aspects of humor are likely driven by broader semantic context, whereas appreciating humor on a per-word basis links to separate factors.",>Tomas Engelthaler>Thomas Hills,>University of Warwick>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0722/index.html
2017,What’s on your wandering mind? The content of mind wandering during text- and film comprehension,"What do we think about when our mind wanders? We asked 88 students to read an instructional text and watch a film (each 20 minutes) and report whenever they found themselves zoning out. Each time they did, we asked them to report their thoughts and what, if anything, triggered them. We then categorized these thoughts (1208 in total) based on their content, and found that in contrast with previous studies, only 17% involved prospection whereas 33% consisted of autobiographical and semantic memory retrieval. This discrepancy might be driven by the rich content of stimuli: 71% of autobiographical and semantic retrieval was explicitly triggered by the text or film, compared to 28% of prospection. Latent semantic analysis revealed that memories were more similar to their triggers than prospective thoughts, suggesting that a substantial proportion of mind wandering is driven by the content of our environment.",>Myrthe Faber>Sidney Dmello,">University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States>University of Notre Dame",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0723/index.html
2017,Interaction with a robot changes human motor behavior,"Social judgments about other people are often made based on visual appearance. In this study, we investigated whether visual appearance of an interaction partner influences action coordination in social interactions. In a novel interactive augmented reality setup participants interacted (i.e. carried out a high-five) with a life-sized 3D avatar that was either human-looking or robot-looking. Importantly, the kinematics of the avatars were identical for both appearances. We examined whether motion trajectories of a high-five action and other motion trajectory parameters such as velocity, radial error, synchrony, and variability were modulated by the visual appearance of the avatar. Results showed that participants carried out the high-five faster and applied different motion trajectories for the human-looking than for the robot-looking avatar. These findings suggest that visual appearance does not only influence social judgments but also the immediate behavior towards the interaction partner.",>Laura Fademrecht>Tobias Meilinger>Stephan Streuber>Aurelie Saulton>Heinrich Bülthoff>Rouwen Cañal-Bruland>Stephan de La Rosa,">Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany>Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0724/index.html
2017,The differential effects of transmission and interaction on linguistic variation,"Variation in natural language is constrained: languages tend to lose competing variants over time, and where variation persists, its use tends to be conditioned on grammatical or sociolinguistic context. We had adult participants learn and communicate with artificial languages exhibiting unpredictable variation in plural marking. Using an iterated learning procedure, the languages produced by participants were used as training languages for other participants. We passed on either the language produced during a post-training recall test (Recall condition) or the language used while communicating with another participant (Interaction condition). We found that alignment during interaction leads to the elimination of variability: in Interaction chains, one plural marker typically came to dominate. However, in Recall chains, variation became conditioned on linguistic context, rather than being eliminated. This suggests that the pattern of restricted, conditioned variation in natural language reflects the combined influences of biases in learning, recall and interaction.",>Olga Feher>Kenny Smith,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0725/index.html

Conventionally, lexical effects in production tasks get interpreted as evidence of cascaded processing between central and peripheral levels. We compare mean and distribution of keystroke latencies within the same stem as it undergoes affixation in sets such as DEPRESS, DEPRESSION, DEPRESSIVE. Novel is the comparison of stems that differ with respect to number of affixes like SUPER, SUPERIOR, SUPERIORITY.

2017,Probability matching as a cognitive basis of cultural drift,"In the field of cultural evolution, cognitive agents are either seen as perfect imitators who reproduce cultural variants veridically (e.g. Boyd & Richerson 1985) or as imperfect imitators who transform the variants as they replicate them (e.g. Sperber 1996). In this poster, I explain how the transformative view of cognition applies to not only to the generation of variants, but also to the way we learn frequency distributions. Probability matching is a widely-observed human behavior where learners reproduce a frequency distribution over variants with a small amount of error and is equivalent to Wright-Fisher drift when the variance in error is binomial/multinomial. However, humans and learning algorithms can produce error distributions that are non-binomial/non-multinomial, which constitute a broader class of drift processes than those that exist in genetic evolution or in perfect-imitator models of cultural evolution.",>Vanessa Ferdinand,">Santa Fe Institute, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0727/index.html
2017,Is gender-fair langauge needed? How grammatical gender influences representations of discourse referents,"The use of gender-fair language is an important measure to boost gender equality. However, there is wide-spread scepticism as to the usefulness of avoiding male bias in language, even in gendered languages. For instance, in German all nouns carry grammatical gender, and role names are considered generic, even when their gender is masculine. We used a sentence-picture matching task to test whether male references in language induce gendered representations. After presenting a sentence with a role name, a picture of a person was shown. In 48 trials, the factors gender of the role name (masculine vs. feminine) and sex of the person in the picture (woman vs. man) were crossed. The results of 40 participants showed that women after masculine referents were more readily accepted than men after feminine referents, but reaction times increased. Thus, readers interpret some masculine forms as generic, but only with considerable cognitive effort.",>Evelyn Ferstl>Lena Dietsche,">Centre for Cognitive Science, University of Freiburg>Centre for Cognitive Science, University of Freiburg",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0728/index.html

With our framework studies can be implemented in an intuitive graphical user interface without programming. Second, the framework takes care about participant recruitment and third, it outlines options for data visualizations and statistical analysis. Additionally, the framework can be used for sharing not only the recorded data, but also the study design and the analysis.

Compared to risk communication in the medical domain, there is so far only limited evidence on how to best communicate uncertainty for continuous quantities, such as financial returns or wind speeds (Spiegelhalter et al., 2011). The poster presents results from a longitudinal study investigating this question within a real-life setting. We implemented different representations communicating probabilistic weather forecasts within an online information system operated by the German National Weather Service. The system is used by fire brigade coordination centers throughout Germany to prepare for severe weather conditions. By analyzing web usage and search behavior, we investigate which representations users rely upon under real operational constraints.

The results of the study show evidence of development in visual closure abilities across those two ages, suggesting that visual closure is a perceptual ability that continues to develop in the second year of life.

This study explores associations between EF and academic achievement for an ethnic minority sample aged 8–10 years, from high poverty, urban backgrounds. EF skills were measured using stop-signal (inhibition), continuous performance (sustained attention), task-switching (cognitive flexibility), spatial span (working memory) and Tower of Hanoi (planning). In addition, we included a popular standardized test of academic ability commonly used by schools to measure literacy, numeracy and science skills and the Raven’s Progressive Matrices task to measure general cognitive ability. EF is differentiated in this sample and is linked to academic achievement.

Local neural activities within a brain region during a symbolic communication task (Konno et al., 2013), where two participants try to establish a symbolic communication system from scratch, has been studied (Li et al, 2015). It is, however, not certain how information bindings between different brain regions is involved in a cognitive process associated with the establishment process. We analyzed EEG phase synchronization, as a measure of functional connectivity, of participants engaged in the symbolic communication task. We found the recruitment of fronto-occipital synchronization at 40 Hz frequency (gamma band), when a symbolic message was displayed, became fast when establishing a symbolic communication system. This finding suggests that frontal-occipital information binding by phase synchronization becomes efficiently used in the course of mutual understanding of symbolic messages.",>Masayuki Fujiwara>Takashi Hashimoto>Guanhong Li>Jiro Okuda>Takeshi Konno>Kazuyuki Samejima>Junya Morita,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Kyoto Sangyo University>Kanazawa Institute of Technology>Tamagawa University>Shizuoka University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0733/index.html

We carried out a questionnaire on the understandability and physical feasibility of various jumping actions in Japanese, and then conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to jump according to these instructions. After the physical performances the participants were asked to rate the easiness of the actions in a second questionnaire, and the results of the two questionnaires were compared. The results show that the understandability of the instructions and the participants’ beliefs about the physical feasibility of the instructions were closely correlated. However, the results of the two questionnaires did not correlate. The results suggest that although participants believe they can convert jump instructions into physical performances if the instructions are easy to understand, there are some gaps between the understandability of the linguistic instructions and the physical realization of them.",>Chie Fukada>Noriyuki Kida>Hiromichi Hagihara>Takatsugu Kojima,">Kyoto Institute of Technology>Kyoto Institute of Technology>Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University>Shiga University of Medical Science",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0734/index.html
2017,The Price of Fear: Developing a behavioural assessment of fear-related avoidance incorporating dynamic response measures.,"In economics, “willingness to pay” reflects subjective value which has been employed to price goods, and more recently, negative outcomes. The current project proposes a protocol for the behavioural assessment of fear-related avoidance based on how much an individual is willing to pay to avoid their fears. The proposed protocol consists of a “card game” interface in which participants make choices in several stages. During baseline, participants chose between two decks that provide differential point rewards. Across a series of experimental blocks, feared stimuli (e.g. a spider image) were presented in addition to rewards when the richer deck was chosen. Rewards were then manipulated, in a staircase fashion, to establish the value of the feared stimulus. Mouse and eye movements were tracked in an attempt to track cognitive processes during decision-making and avoidance.

Change-blindness in event description tasks is informative about the interrelation between visual perception and language planning,"The visual processing of complex event stimuli and the planning of utterances to describe them happen rapidly and partly overlap in time, posing a challenge to researchers on vision and language: How exactly do the processes interact? As a test case we investigate how sudden content-changes in visual scenes affect speakers of different languages. In a novel approach, we elicit event descriptions from naturalistic video stimuli of motion events consisting of two segments (240ms each), each followed by a mask (80ms). A potential change-blindness situation regarding the presence/absence of the goal of motion is created. We exploit typological differences between French and German regarding the verbal encoding of goal-orientation. Analyses of the linguistic data (content and timing) reveals a language-specific effect regarding how subjects accommodate to seemingly unnoticed changes (e.g., distribution of hesitations, temporal onsets of words).

However, we understand surprisingly little about the mechanisms through which these representations are acquired. What kinds of statistical relationships would learners need to compute to construct representations like those posited by linguistic theory? We created miniature languages containing patterns found in natural languages and also patterns not found in natural languages. We showed that complex word-order contingencies are acquired only when they correlate with morphological patterns like those in natural languages. We then asked how learning changes when the statistical evidence for these patterns is manipulated.

2017,Computational Modelling of Embodied Semantic Cognition: A Deep Learning Approach,"Barsalou’s (1999, 2003) perceptual symbol systems hypothesis describes how semantic knowledge is grounded in sensorimotor experience. According to the theory, knowledge is acquired through sensorimotor simulations. This challenges the classical view supported by the disembodied cognition hypothesis, which generally favours an abstract and symbolic system. We propose a unified perspective, in which, the embodied cognition hypothesis, with a particular focus on the semantic domain, is provided with a mechanistically tractable computational framework based on the parallel distributed processing (PDP) paradigm. A critical difference between the current approach and previous mechanistic accounts of embodied cognition is that the current approach avoids using hand-coded representations and instead, relies on an agent-based simulation with environmental interaction for the creation of situated inputs and outputs, supplemented with supervised and unsupervised deep learning mechanisms, from which semantic cognition emerges.",>Ajitesh Ghose>Rick Cooper,">Centre for Cognition, Computation and Modelling Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London Malet Street, London, WC1E 7HX, United Kingdom>Centre for Cognition, Computation and Modelling Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London Malet Street, London, WC1E 7HX, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0738/index.html
2017,The Perceived Duration of Vast Spaces,"Experiencing awe may make us believe we have more time (Rudd, Vohs, & Aaker, 2012). Awe can be evoked by encountering a vast experience (Keltner & Haidt, 2003), for example an endless ocean or large mountains (Klatzky, Thompson, Stefanucci, Gill, & McGee, 2017). Vast environments may lead to distortions in perceived time that are reported after awe experiences. Participants reproduced the perceived duration of images of natural environments that varied in vastness and estimated the degree awe they would experience in those spaces. Results show that as actual duration increased, perceived duration of the image decreased, whereas estimated awe increased. The perceived duration of highly vast images was underestimated less than other images. Participants reported they would experience more awe in highly vast images compared to low and medium vast images. These findings suggest that distortions of time associated with awe may be related to the vastness of the environment.",>Devin Gill>Jeanine Stefanucci,">University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0739/index.html

I will present findings from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies to highlight the importance of spatial skills as both longitudinal and concurrent predictors of mathematics. First, secondary data analysis of the Millennium Cohort Study indicates that spatial performance at both 5 and 7 years is a significant predictor of mathematics at age 7 (N = 12099). Second, cross-sectional findings from children aged 5-10 years (N=156), suggest that spatial skills explain 10-12% of the variation in standardised maths performance and approximate number sense, even after accounting for vocabulary skills. That is, spatial scaling was a significant predictor of mathematics for all age groups, while the role of mental rotation and mental folding varied with age. These findings have implications for the design of mathematics interventions customised for specific developmental stages.",>Katie Gilligan>Alex Hodgkiss>Michael Thomas>Emily Farran,">UCL Institute of Education, London, United Kingdom>UCL Institute of Education, London, United Kingdom>Birkbeck College, University of London>UCL Institute of Education, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0740/index.html
2017,Investigating the predictions of a memory-based account of statistical learning,"Statistical learning (SL) refers to the ability to extract statistical regularities from the environment. Many researchers believe that SL arises as a consequence of the way that information is stored and accessed in memory (Thiessen, Kronstein, & Hufnagle, 2013). Accordingly, manipulations that influence memory should have similar effects in SL experiments. In the current study, participants were presented with artificial languages that varied along two dimensions known to impact memory: number of distractors in the input and timing of presentation (e.g., spaced vs. massed). Participants' performance was clearly influenced by these manipulations; for example, the ability to segment a word (e.g., ""dupona"") differed as a function of whether there was one frequent competitor (e.g., ""dugalo"") or several less frequent competitors (e.g., ""dugalo,"" ""dufalu,"" ""dumiso"").

We investigated whether right-handers, who exert greater force with their right than left hands, judge candidate causes on the right side as more causal. In two experiments, subjects simultaneously learned about a moderately effective and an ineffective cause on a trial-by-trial basis. Subjects rated the moderately effective cause as more causal when it appeared on the right side of space. This effect was also present in subjects’ trial-by-trial predictions, but the effect reversed with a left-right reversal in the spatial-numeric mapping of the causal judgment scale. The results are not consistent with the notion that our understanding of causation is grounded in our ability to exert force.

2017,Comparison of directed gaze during vocalizations in bonobo and human infants,"A crucial step in language evolution was likely joint attention with alternating gaze between vocalizing individuals and an object. This triadic interaction likely formed a foundation for labeling of objects. We have argued that vocalizations used for “social glue” – flexible low intensity and low arousal vocalizations given during e.g. grooming, keeping in contact with the group, etc. – are a probable source of raw material for first labels. It is critical that these vocalizations be socially directed, by gaze contact. We longitudinally investigated directed gaze during vocalizations in low arousal interactions during the first year in three bonobo mother-infant pairs and compared them with 9 human mother-infant pairs. We found that bonobo infants directed their gaze to a conspecific during vocalizations only 8% of the time while human infants directed it 44% of the time.",>Ulrike Griebel>Josep Call>Eugene Buder>D.

Known as cross-situational learning, this ability is thought to be an important means of acquiring language. Proposed models of this ability range from hypothesis-testing accounts to associative accounts, but most formal models assume learners store one or more feasible word-referent mappings per experience, and that the correct mappings emerge through consistent co-occurrence. These theories would all predict that presenting unambiguous evidence for a correct pair would benefit learning, but recent evidence indicates the reverse is true: giving unambiguous evidence for incorrect pairs improves subsequent cross-situational learning (Fitneva and Christiansen, 2015). With some nuances, we replicate these results, and show why future models may need to include an error-driven learning mechanism to explain word learning.",>Chris Grimmick>George Kachergis>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>Radboud University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0744/index.html
2017,On the Detection of “Alternative Facts” in Environmental Messages: The Effects of a Sequential versus a Simultaneous Presentation Format,"Reasonable rational information processing is important in people’s in everyday decision-making. A number of features affect how environmental messages are processed, including the presentation format and the reliability of the information source. One way to measure the importance assigned to the source reliability is to frame the question in terms of Bayes’ theorem (Hahn & Harris, 2009). In two online experiments, we investigated how people process environmental messages in a Bayesian integration task where the participants rate the probability of an energy crisis. The information about the prior, likelihood ratio, and source reliability were presented either sequentially or simultaneously. The results showed that, as prescribed by Bayes’ theorem, participants integrated the sentences multiplicatively. However, with sequential presentation they assigned more weight to source reliability, and this effect remained when the source reliability was presented next to last, suggesting that participants assigned more weight to the source regardless of its position.",>Mona Guath>Peter Juslin,">Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden>Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0745/index.html
2017,Exploring inductive bias of visual scenes,"When people encode a representation of a scene, they do not necessarily represent the exact locations and orientations of the constituent elements. Instead, people rely on preexisting inductive biases to simplify their encoding of new scene configurations. We investigated people's inductive biases in their memory for configurations of simple 2D shapes (such as circles, triangles, etc.) using a serial reproduction paradigm (Bartlett, 1932). This paradigm establishes an iterative process in which information is transmitted through a chain of people (like the ""telephone"" game). In our experiment, we asked people to memorize configurations of simple shapes (which were either generated at random or by other participants) and then asked them to reproduce those configurations. In analyzing the final generation of reproductions, we found that people have strong preferences for the scale of individual shapes, as well as the alignment, distance, overlap, and relative rotation between pairs of shapes.",>Jessica Hamrick>David Bourgin>Thomas Langlois>Tom Griffiths,">University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0746/index.html
2017,Choosing while Losing: The Effects of Valence and Relative Magnitude on Decision Dynamics.,"Framing decision options as gains or as losses affects how we evaluate those options. The current study assessed the effects of gain- and loss-framing on the acquisition of outcome values across decisions and on the dynamics of computer mouse responses to those decisions. In a series of 36 decisions per block, four arbitrary symbols were presented, two of which were assigned high points (e.g., 20) and two of which were assigned low points (e.g., 5). Participants (N=86) learned to choose high values and avoid low values when values were positive and to choose low values and avoid high values when they were negative.

2017,"The Relationship between Anxiety, Mind Wandering and Task-switching: A Diffusion Model Analysis","The current study aims to examine the mechanisms underlying the negative impact of anxiety on task-switching. To do so, we employed a stochastic diffusion model analysis along with a thought-probe technique in task-switching paradigm. Across 152 participants, we found state anxiety was associated to higher switch costs in nondecision time but not drift rate parameter of diffusion model, implying that the locus of task-switching impairment in anxious individuals is pertinent to the efficiency of task-set reconfiguration but not proactive interference processes. Furthermore, we found boundary separation parameter – which quantifies conservative decisional styles – heightened as a function of anxiety, supporting the existence of compensatory strategy in anxious individuals. Lastly, we found that impaired performance by anxiety was not attributed to the frequency of worrisome thoughts during task-switching. These findings elucidate several theoretical assumptions on the relationship between anxiety and task-switching.",>Andree Hartanto>Hwajin Yang,>Singapore Management University>Singapore Management University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0748/index.html
2017,Do people behave dishonestly easily?,"This study examines whether dishonest behaviors occur easily. In 60 trials, 100 undergraduate students viewed 20 dots on a square divided into right and left sides and had to decide which side contained more dots within one second (developed by Gino et al., 2010). In with-reward condition, participants received 0.1 point for each left decision and 1 point for each right decision, and they received more sweets depending on points. Therefore, this asymmetrical payment structure triggered motivation to dishonestly report more right-side dots, even when there are actually more left-side dots. The results demonstrate that participants decided at greater frequencies that more dots were on the right side in with-reward condition than in without-reward condition, indicating dishonest behaviors occurred. Furthermore, participants with greater right-side frequencies in with-reward condition showed lower points on a morality scale. These results suggest dishonest behaviors occur easily and are related with a decline in morality.",>Hajimu Hayashi,>Kobe University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0749/index.html
2017,Hierarchical Processing of Response Production and Categorisation,"Early research on categorisation suggested that verbalizable and nonverbalizable category-learning are qualitatively different. Toward this end, the implementational-level model (COVIS--COmpetition between Verbal and Implicit Systems) of categorisation assumes that category-learning involves separate but parallel sub-systems. Specifically, for verbalizable tasks abstract category-labels are learned by a hypothesis-testing sub-system, while for nonvertbalizable tasks response position is learned by a procedural-learning sub-system. However, recent research has revealed that: 1) regardless of category structure, reversal learning is easier than learning novel categories; 2) qualitative difference between verbalizable and nonverbalizable tasks disappears when automaticity has developed; and 3) control of automatic categorisation is different from both proposed sub-systems. These challenges suggest a fundamental revision of the mechanisms of categorisation. Contrary to the separate, parallel-processing sub-systems theory, we argue that categorisation involves hierarchical-processing sub-systems of response-production and category-label association. This framework, when combined with Supervisory Attentional System theory, may facilitate the unification of human categorisation.",>Liusha He>Rick Cooper,">Centre for Cognition, Computation and Modelling Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London, London, London, United Kingdom>Birkbeck, University of London, London, England, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0750/index.html
2017,Where are you? The Effect of Uncertainty and its Visual Representation on Location Judgments in GPS-like Displays,"Two experiments revealed how non-experts interpret visualizations of positional uncertainty on GPS-like displays and how the visual representation of uncertainty affects their judgments. Participants were shown maps with representations of their current location; locational uncertainty was visualized as either a circle (confidence interval) or a faded glyph (indicating the probability density function directly). When shown a single circle or faded glyph, participants assumed they were located at the center of the uncertain region. In a task that required combining two uncertain estimates of their location, the most common strategy – integration – was to take both estimates into account, with more weight given to the more certain estimate. Participants’ strategies were not affected by how uncertainty was visualized, but visualization affected the consistency of their responses. The results indicate that non-experts have an intuitive understanding of uncertainty and that the best visualization method is task dependent.",>Mary Hegarty>Alinda Friedman>Alexander P.

2017,Semantic Bootstrapping in Frames: A Computational Model of Syntactic Category Acquisition,"Semantic Bootstrapping in Frames: A Computational Model of Syntactic Category Acquisition According to the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis, children map certain (prototypical) semantic concepts to syntactic categories (e.g., objects as nouns, actions as verbs), which are then used to learn other elements of language. We report a computational model of syntactic category acquisition that combines semantic bootstrapping with the distributional learning of language. The model has access to a small set of “seed” words, with labeled categories. It then iteratively constructs syntactic frames from the seeds; sufficiently frequent frames are used to categorize non-seeded words which then contribute to the construction of additional frames, including frames that incorporate category information. The model is online and effective. Simulation on child-directed English corpus shows that with only 100 seed words, classification precision exceeds 70%.",>John Hewitt>Charles Yang,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0752/index.html
2017,Tangible rhythm: Sensorimotor representations of metrical structure and learning musical rhythm with gesture,"When we listen to music, we can mentally control how we perceive the beat. This ability is thought to be subserved by sensorimotor imagery, having top-down effects on attentional-allocation and perception. Here, we examine whether imagined “up and down” gestures can support an internal generation of metrical accent in rhythmic sequences. We also examine how this type of motor imagery interacts with either metrically congruent or incongruent auditory imagery. This is explored using EEG with a frequency-tagging approach, quantifying the strength of metrical accent with the amplitude of beat-related SSEPs. Gesture supports our ability to think and learn by fostering an alignment between sensorimotor representations and more abstract conceptual structure. Therefore, the imagined gestures may act as a bridge between perceptual and action-oriented understandings of metrical structure and the more abstract conceptual ones that musicians struggle with in their training. These imagery strategies may then be beneficial to music education.",>Courtney Hilton>Micah Goldwater>Michael Jacobson,">The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia>The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia>The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0753/index.html

Previous research has proposed that a common sense engine implementing probabilistic programming is used to build an internal model of the environment, and simulations of that internal model are used for inferences. Battaglia et al.(2013) have demonstrated an application of this formulation in physical scene understanding and stability judgment in the case of block tower. Here we augment this formulation by including the subjects’ eye movements as a process of sampling the environment, and propose that the underlying common sense model guides gaze toward sampling the features of the space with relevant information for the judgments about stability. We compare a base probabilistic model with one that takes the statistics of the saccades into account, and argue that the additional information improves the model predictions about subjects’ judgment.",>Eghbal Hosseini>Eli Pollock>Tobias Gerstenberg,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0754/index.html
2017,Data Driven Eye Gaze Path Segmentation,"The first stage of analyzing eye-tracking data is commonly to code the data into sequences of fixations and saccades. This is usually automated using simple, predetermined rules for classifying ranges of the time series into events, such as ``if the dispersion of gaze samples is lower than the threshold, then code as a fixation.'' More recent approaches incorporate additional eye-movement categories in automated parsing algorithms, particularly glissades, by using time-varying, data-driven thresholds. We describe an alternative approach using the beta-process auto-regressive hidden Markov model (BP-AR HMM). The BP-AR-HMM offers two main advantages over existing frameworks. First, it provides a statistical model for eye movement classification rather than a single estimate. Second, the BP-AR-HMM uses a latent process to model the number and nature of the types of eye-movements and hence is not constrained to predetermined categories. We present comparisons between BP-AR-HMM parsing and standard analyses on multiple datasets.",>Joseph Houpt>Mary Frame>Leslie Blaha,">Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio, USA>Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, USA>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0755/index.html

The results indicated that at the age of 2, Mandarin preschoolers exhibited abstraction of syntax in these four constructions. These results went against the predictions of accounts derived from the structure mapping account and from the competition model.

However, studies have rarely explored the RAP processes. The main purpose of this study was to record eye movements while solving RAP. The results show that: (1) The mean fixation duration increases throughout the problem-solving process, which indicates that more problem solvers encounter impasses. This result supports the “impasse encounter” phase of insight. (2) During the initial period of problem solving, individuals display more regression counts in the fixation region than in the key region, which supports that the impasses are caused by inappropriate initial representation. (3) During the middle period of the process, the time individuals spend gazing at the key region increases, while the time spend at the fixation region decreases. This supports the “impasse resolution and insight” phase of insight.",>Po-Sheng Huang>Shu-Ling Peng>Jon-Fan Hu,">Hsuan Chuang University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.>National Cheng Kung Univeristy, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC>National Cheng Kung Univeristy, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0757/index.html
2017,Processing of Filler-gap Dependency in Island Constraints and its Relation to Working Memory for Non-native Speakers of English,"Whether non-native speakers’ on-line processing can be native-like remains a hot issue. Recently many have shown that qualitatively native-like processing is attainable, especially for learners with high proficiency. However, most of the studies recruited learners who had been immersed to the English-speaking country. The current study investigated processing of filler-gap dependency and island constraints for Chinese learners of English as a second but foreign language. We also attempted to look into individual differences by taking different variables into account. The results showed that native-like active gap-filling strategy positively correlated with L2 proficiency, native-like island effect negatively correlated with age of acquisition, but neither one correlated with working memory capacity. These findings lent more support to the grammar-based account for island effects, though future studies adopting more precise measure of working memory would be needed.

Participants were shown haikus in Chinese and the corresponding English translations and were asked to rate the translation quality. The English translations ranged from literal to free style and differed in two source text factors — phrase order and lexical choice. Results indicated an interaction between translation style and language proficiency, with the high proficiency bilinguals giving free translations higher ratings. Furthermore, the analyses of eye movements revealed that, (a) in contrast to low proficiency bilinguals, high proficiency bilinguals tended to integrate discourse information regardless of intra-text re-ordering, and (b) among the good quality translations, the phrase order effect was more prominent than the lexical effect. These findings suggest the interplaying roles of language proficiency and linguistic factors in translation.",>Xin Huang>Wei (sophia) Deng>Defeng Li,>University of Macau>University of Macau>University of Macau,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0759/index.html
2017,How reactivation strength affects memory updating,"Memory reactivation induces plasticity, rendering reactivated memories susceptible to interference. The current study examined whether the method and strength of reactivation modulates retroactive interference effects. Two days after learning AB word pairs, memory for these pairs was either not reactivated, moderately reactivated (presentation of A cues in an unrelated task), or strongly reactivated (restudy of AB pairs or cued recall of B targets). Immediately afterwards, participants either learned AC word pairs, DE word pairs, or performed an unrelated distractor task. Cued recall of target words was tested two days later. Strong reactivation before learning new material protected memory from retroactive interference and intrusions, whereas moderate reactivation resulted in both. This finding suggests that strong reactivation enhances event-based distinctiveness, counteracting memory modification. Results are discussed in reference to the testing effect literature and the reconsolidation account, and implications for educational practice are outlined.",>Scully Iiona>Hupbach Almut,>Lehigh University>Lehigh University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0760/index.html

Lack of an interactive context for joint action particularly limited social neuroscience studies to simulated social contexts. Advances in portable brain imaging technologies have made it practical to simultaneously monitor the brain activity of two or more people in an interactive context to investigate neural correlates of social interaction. In this study, the relationship between behavioral synchrony and inter-brain coherence is investigated during simultaneous reading of matching and mismatching sentences in different auditory conditions. A dual-fNIRS hyperscanning setup was used to obtain simultaneous recordings of hemodynamic activity from the prefrontal cortices of the participants while they jointly read-aloud the sentences displayed on their screens.

We compared prediction and learning across groups by fitting their occipital cortex response (which we assumed to reflect the magnitude of the prediction error) to a reinforcement learning model with a dynamic learning rate.

However, this work has not compared endpoints to other potentially salient points in the internal temporal profile of events (e.g., midpoints). Building on the “picky puppet task” (Waxman & Gelman, 1986), we presented 4-to-5-year-old children and adults with a puppet that liked clips of events containing brief screen blanks that disrupted either the midpoint or the endpoint of the event. Both children and adults learned the puppet’s preferences better (as evidenced by their extension to novel events) when the puppet liked midpoint compared to endpoint interruptions.

2017,Dynamic and multiplexed networks for working memory,"Working memory (WM) provides the neurobiological infrastructure for human cognition. Dominant models posit that prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports WM by coordinating control over distributed memory representations. In two studies, multimodal electrophysiology data reveal that PFC control over WM is rhythmic, fundamentally dynamic, and not altogether necessary. Direct brain recordings (n=10) demonstrate that PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL) theta-band rhythms direct a complex system of higher-frequency neural activity across regions, uncovering initial support for bidirectional PFC-MTL interactions related to WM demands. Then, data from patients with unilateral PFC damage (n=14) challenge dominant models on the central role of PFC (note 8% accuracy decrease in patients). In healthy controls (n=20), delta-theta-band rhythms precess from PFC toward parieto-occipital sites, concurrent with alpha-beta-band rhythms precessing in the opposite direction. All PFC effects are diminished with unilateral damage, revealing an independent posterior WM mechanism.

This effect has been shown in various domains and referred to as the law of minimum effort or demand avoidance. Kool and colleagues (2010, 2013) designed the demand selection task (DST) and showed that most of their participants exhibited clear demand avoidance. We attempted to replicate and extend their results in a series of three studies. Here we argue that DST confounds demand detection and demand selection, which weakens its ability to reliably measure demand avoidance in different populations. In our first study, most participants did not show reliable demand avoidance and those who showed it had higher working memory capacity. The following two studies aimed to de-confound the two processes.

The best practice set depends on the way people are learning. We describe two models people employ when learning arithmetic problems. We show that features of the task environment influence model use. When problems are presented in a purely symbolic format, people learn an item-specific model. When the task format linked problems to representations of magnitudes, people learn a continuous model. We also test the effects of different practice sets on learning. In both formats people learned the practice sets well with a few repeated examples. With a continuous magnitude format people showed better transfer with a wide variety of practice problems. Variety led to poor learning in the symbolic format.

There are some suggestions this averseness is due differences in the inferred prior distribution (Güney & Newell, 2015). In this study we investigated the relationship between prior distributions and information cues on decision making and participants’ judgments of underlying distribution. We used three different prior cues; a positive underlying distributional cue, a negative underlying distributional cue, and a neutral cue. We also used five different information cues which varied both the bias of the information and the degree of ambiguity. Whilst we found that both prior and information manipulations had the expected impact for participants’ judgments of underlying distributions, they only impacted the decisions participants made in some cases.

The actors in the dilemmas were represented by a series of silhouettes. Eye tracking data revealed that both manipulations had an effect on participants' gaze. Further analysis of utilitarian choices has shown that there were no framing effects of the prompting question when the dilemmas were impersonal. The data suggests that participants' subsequent gaze patterns are sensitive to both how the situation is described and the framing of their hypothetical actions.

The middle age (MA) group was worse in word retrieval (U = 23950.5, p = 0.003) and had less GM volume in a range of left fronto-temporal areas relative to the young group, but there were no statistically significant correlations between volumes of the regions known to be implicated in word retrieval and MA’s TOT scores. Thus, midlife word retrieval decline is not associated with GM volume reduction; more likely it is due to changes in connectivity.",>Vanja Kljajevic,">University of the Basque Country, Vitoria & IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0770/index.html

Their task was to choose questions relevant to links in the chain. Some explanations contained ""breaks"" in the chain, whereas others did not. Participants in three studies were able to detect the breaks, and preliminary data suggest that they assess explanations with breaks as less complete than those without breaks. Many participants also chose to ask questions about the initial event in a causal chain (e.g., A in the chain above), suggesting that such initial events are themselves seen as incomplete.

2017,Different alternative explanations can render different information relevant to explaining an event,"Scientific reasoning includes deciding whether information is relevant to explaining an event. In some cases, seeing information as relevant requires having a background theory or explanation that can make sense of the information. College students were shown a possible explanation for an event, along with two pieces of possibly relevant information (Info1 and Info2), and one of two possible alternative explanations (Alt1 or Alt2). Info1 was seen as more relevant when Alt1 rather than Alt2 was presented; Info2 was seen as more relevant when Alt2 rather than Alt1 was presented. In addition, relevance ratings of the information increased as did initial ratings of the Alternative. People from different backgrounds might bring with them different alternative theories that can hinder the understanding of why some information is relevant and other information not.

Atypical properties of objects are more likely to be included in referring expressions than typical ones. E.g., speakers are more likely to call a blue banana a “blue banana” and a yellow banana a ""banana"". A unified account of this phenomenon is lacking. When should a rational speaker mention an object’s color? Reference production is modeled within the Rational Speech Act framework. Utterances (“banana”, “blue”, and “blue banana”) are taken to have a graded semantics: rather than assuming all bananas are equally good instances of “banana”, we empirically elicited object-utterance typicality values for all possible utterances. Pragmatic speakers select utterances proportionally to the probability that a literal listener using a graded semantics will select the intended referent.

2017,Why Would 'Same' Go With 'Same'? Exploring New Factors Required For Relational Reasoning,"Relational Match to Sample (RMTS) is a common test of relational reasoning involving matching cards based on the relations “same” and “different”. Children below the age of five fail RMTS, even with corrective feedback. Given that success on RMTS depends on the ability to represent and compare ""same"" and ""different"", such failure has been interpreted as indicative of the absence of these abilities (Penn, Holyoak & Povinelli, 2008; Hochmann, Mody & Carey, 2016). In the current studies three, four and five-year-old children were provided explicit instructions on RMTS. Results show success in all groups, including three-year-olds - two years earlier than previous work. This suggests the ability to represent and compare ""same"" and ""different"" emerges significantly earlier than spontaneous success on RMTS, undermining previous interpretations.

2017,When reading is harder than a mother kucker: Top-down effects of the taboo-ness on novel word pronunciation,"When pronouncing novel/unknown words, readers often use prior experience with similar, neighbor words. Comparison to neighbors can be helpful for unknown or novel words (wug is like pug), but it can also lead to errors (pint is not like mint). We investigate whether pronunciation can be affected by top-down influences, specifically the perceived taboo-ness of a known neighbor. While orthographic similarity typically biases novel-word pronunciation to be similar to a known word, taboo-ness might bias pronunciation away from a likely one. Adults read aloud words from three lists– novel words that were neighbors to taboo words, novel words that were neighbors to benign words, and known control words. All known neighbors and controls were frequency matched. Results show differences in the correspondence between pronunciation of novel words and known neighbors depending on the relative taboo-ness of the known neighbor. Findings suggest that perceived taboo-ness has top-down influences on reading.",>Sarah Kucker>Lynn Perry,">University of Wisconsin Oshkosh>University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0777/index.html
2017,Effects of Variable Response-Stimulus Interval (RSI) On Sequence Learning,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of varying Response-to-Stimulus interval (RSI) on sequence learning by systematically varying it across three different groups (Group1: 0-300ms, Group2: 400-700ms and Group3: 800-1100ms) and to assess the implicitness and explicitness of the knowledge acquired through such learning. Serial Reaction time task followed by generation task and recognition task were used for this purpose. Results of the SRT task showed learning in all the three groups and the results of the free generation task and recognition task revealed that the sequence learning was implicit in Groups 1 and 2 while it was explicit in Group3. These results were discussed in the context of a recent theoretical framework that proposes conditions in which a switch from implicit to explicit knowledge acquisition is facilitated.",>Sneha Kummetha>Anuj Shukla>Raju Bapi,">Cognitive Science Lab, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India>Cognitive Science Lab, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India>Cognitive Science Lab, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India and School of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0778/index.html
2017,Object Understanding: Exploring the Path from Percept to Meaning,"This research addresses the generation of meaningful interpretations of real-world perceptual stimuli. According to a widespread framework we will call the features-first view, a stimulus is initially encoded via semantically-laden, symbol-like properties that are compared to stored category representations to find the best match. Alternative theoretical perspectives challenge the features-first view, but there has been no direct empirical test. In our experiment, participants were shown photographic images of everyday objects and asked to judge as quickly as possible whether a provided verbal descriptive matched the picture. We tested different levels of delay between image and descriptive and found evidence that basic-level category labels were verified faster than clearly manifested descriptions of physical or functional properties. Accordingly, people know the category of the stimulus before knowing its semantic properties. The present evidence suggests that the category is used to achieve a property-level description of the meaning of the stimulus, not vice-versa.",>Kenneth Kurtz>Daniel Silliman,>Binghamton University>Binghamton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0779/index.html
2017,Effect of Touch-produced Sounds on Surface Texture Perception,"Texture is an important source of information for distinguishing surface properties. We are able to perceive various textural properties of surfaces from tactile or visual inputs. However, it is unclear how touch-produced sounds influence the various surface texture perceptions. In this study, we examined whether the touch sounds produced by different surface textures influence the various surface perceptions. Consequently, the surface textures with high height and wide interval resulted in rough, bumpy, soft and cool perceptions and the surface textures with the low height and narrow interval resulted in smooth, flat, hard and warm perception. Also, there were statistically significant differences in these measures between two surface texture groups. Furthermore, significantly positive correlations were found in “rough – smooth”, “bumpy – flat”, “sticky – slippery”, “wet – dry” and “unpleasant – pleasant” measures between touch-produced sounds and actual touch. This indicate that the touch-produced sounds influence various surface perceptions.",>Jinhwan Kwon>Suguru Hata>Natsumi Komoto>Maki Sakamoto,">Department of Informatics, The University of Electro-Communications>Department of Informatics, The University of Electro-Communications>Department of Informatics, The University of Electro-Communications>Department of Informatics, The University of Electro-Communications",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0780/index.html
2017,Identifying Causal Direction in the Two-Variable Case,"One of the key characteristics of human cognition is the ability to learn causal structure from data. An influential thread of research into causal learning relies on causal graphical models as a theoretical foundation, and emphasizes the role of prior knowledge, interventions, and statistical independence as tools with which people learn causal structure. What if these sources of information are all absent, as in the problem of identifying causal direction from observations of just two variables? Most work has either ignored this problem or asserted that it is inherently unsolvable. However, recent machine learning algorithms can sometimes infer causal directionality in this setting, by exploiting simple assumptions about the relationship between causes and the noise observed in their effects (Mooij, et al 2016). We investigate whether humans are able to exploit these assumptions or others in order to infer the causal connection between two statistically dependent variables.",>Pablo León-Villagrá>Christopher Lucas,">University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0781/index.html
2017,Intolerance to uncertainty is associated with diminished exploration,"Across diverse cognitive and behavioral domains, humans confront a fundamental tension between exploiting current knowledge about the environment and exploring the environment in order to acquire new knowledge. Individuals differ idiosyncratically in how they balance this explore/exploit tradeoff, although the sources of these individual differences have not been systematically studied. In the current study, we sought to do so, in terms of trait-level affective phenotypes. Specifically, we investigated whether intolerance to uncertainty (IU), characterized by a negative disposition toward uncertainty, predicted both random and directed exploration in a two-armed bandit task which manipulated decision horizon. We found that greater IU was associated with diminished exploration, both random (p<0.001) and directed (p<0.05). These results suggest the importance of explicitly considering affective states and dispositions in human decision-making and also have psychiatric implications, to the extent that IU is a transdiagnostic dimension central to a range of anxiety-related disorders.",>Jennifer Lenow>Nathaniel Daw>Elizabeth Phelps,">Department of Psychology, New York University, New York, NY, USA>Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ>Department of Psychology, New York University, New York, NY, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0782/index.html
2017,Interplay between semantic and emotional information in visual scene processing,"We examined whether and how image’s semantics and emotion content interact during visual processing. In each trial, we briefly presented two emotional or neutral images (a scene context and an object), manipulating the semantic consistency and the emotional consistency of the pair. Participants categorised one image semantically or emotionally. Semantic categorisation was overall better than emotional categorisation, but reduced in emotional compared to neutral images, and especially in negative images. Emotional categorisation was better for positive than neutral or negative images; moreover, it was facilitated by emotional consistency and, for accuracy in context images, by semantic consistency. Our results show easiness of semantic compared to emotional categorisation. They suggest that semantic and emotion processes are interdependent, although emotional influence on semantic processing seems stronger than the counterpart, with in particular an interfering effect of aversive images. Conversely, image’s attractiveness seems beneficial when evaluating the quality of the emotional content.",>Anaïs Leroy>Sylvane Faure>Sara Spotorno,">Laboratoire d’Anthropologie et de Psychologie Cliniques Cognitives et Sociales, Université Côte d’Azur, France>Laboratoire d’Anthropologie et de Psychologie Cliniques Cognitives et Sociales, Université Côte d’Azur, France>Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0783/index.html
2017,The effect of binaural beats on inhibition,"A binaural beat is the perceptual experience that occurs when two tones of slightly different frequencies are presented dichotically, creating the experience of a third tone corresponding to the difference in frequencies. Many temporary cognitive effects have been linked to the presentation of a binaural beat, including increased working memory capacity. In the present study, a version of the flanker test was used to investigate the effect of short-term alpha wave binaural beat stimulation on inhibition processes specifically. Participants were presented with 10 minutes of either mid-alpha range binaural beats combined with a recording of waves or only the sound of waves. After this, participants completed a flanker test. The difference between reaction times of congruent and incongruent trials on the flanker task was significantly lower in the binaural beats condition than the wave condition, suggesting that even brief exposure to binaural beats aids in the inhibition of irrelevant stimuli.",>Kimery Levering>Molly Poinan>Kristin Jay,">Marist College, Poughkeepsie, NY>Marist College, Poughkeepsie, NY>Marist College, Poughkeepsie, NY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0784/index.html
2017,Perception of others: Representation of immigrant groups in newspaper articles,"Immigrants always have difficulties in integrating into a local society, and sometimes these difficulties come from the fact that they are subconsciously regarded as someone from the outside. How they are represented in the main stream media could reflect people’s perceptions towards the ‘otherness’ of different social members. We analyzed the representation of 29 US immigrant groups in newspaper articles in 2 related studies. The favorability of an immigrant groups is highly associated with its perceived social distance (reflected through usage of concrete language) in our research. To further understand what caused the positive or negative image of immigrants, we applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify topics associated with immigrant groups. We also investigated into how these news topics differ in terms of lingual social distance and favorability. The results provide both qualitative and quantitative insights in how the image of immigrants are reproduced in social media.",>Ying Li>Thomas Hills,>University of Warwick>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0785/index.html
2017,Modelling the dynamics of integrating context into perception: in good and in poor readers,"Individuals implicitly learn the statistics of environmental stimuli. We used ""contraction bias"", the tendency to perceive stimuli closer to the estimated mean of similar previous stimuli, to characterize the dynamics of these implicit inference processes. Using a simple auditory discrimination task we found that listeners build a rich representation of the distribution of past stimuli, and yet over represent very recent events. This combined pattern allows both learning of the stable environment, and flexibility to fast changes. We further characterized populations who have difficulties in acquiring specific expertise, i.e. specific developmental disorders, focusing on reading (dyslexia) and non-verbal communication (high functioning ASD, autism spectrum, individuals) disability, respectively. We found that the pattern of their perceptual inference differs from controls'. Both underweight previous events. However, dyslexics' implicit memory decays fast and they underweight earlier events, whereas ASD individuals underweight recent events. This pattern parallels, and perhaps underlies, their strengths and weaknesses.",>Itay Lieder>Vincent Adam>Maneesh Sahani>Merav Ahissar,">ELSC, Hebrew University>Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL>Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL>ELSC, Hebrew University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0786/index.html
2017,The Effects of Familiarity and Typicality on Naming Objects and Faces,"It is found that when we name an object or a face, we often use basic level name (e.g., dog) rather than a name at superordinate level (e.g., animal) or subordinate level (e.g., Labrador). In addition, although abundant evidence generally suggested that both familiarity and typicality influence object recognition, how each of the two factors involves categorization in terms of naming is not fully investigated yet. The present studies were performed to examine the familiarity and typicality effects on naming either an object or a face. Names for basic, superordinate, and subordinate levels were prepared for testing the speed and correctness of object/face identification. As a result, familiarity, not typicality, induced a down-shift pattern for naming. In contrast, typicality led to overall faster responses. The findings of the study indicated that familiarity and typicality have dissimilar effects on categorization by naming.",>Yu-Ching Lin>Jon-Fan Hu>Shu-Ling Peng>Shulan Hsieh,">National Cheng Kung Univeristy, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC>National Cheng Kung Univeristy, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC>National Cheng Kung Univeristy, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC>National Cheng Kung Univeristy, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0787/index.html
2017,The Effect of CSAL AutoTutor on Deep Comprehension of Text in Low-Literacy Adult Readers,"It is well documented that reading strategies of low-literacy readers are suboptimal when text requires deeper levels of comprehension. Deep comprehension demands causal or goal-oriented reasoning and functional conceptual knowledge. Alternatively, shallow comprehension entails recall of definitions or text features without necessitating a coherent understanding of the text. The Center for Adult Literacy (CSAL) AutoTutor is an interactive intelligent tutoring system designed to foster deep and shallow comprehension in low-literacy readers. The present work represents the first empirical study of the effect of CSAL AutoTutor on comprehension type in low- and high-literacy readers. Community members and students interacted with CSAL Autotutor and then were assessed on recall ability for the structure (shallow) and meaning (deep) of sentences from lesson text. Preliminary analysis suggests CSAL AutoTutor promotes comparable deep level comprehension in low- and high-literacy readers.

How do we develop priors that are general enough to apply in various contexts yet specific enough to maximize reward in a given context? We investigated this using the AX-CPT, a task in which a cue determines which button to press for a probe that appears seconds later. We manipulated the frequency of the probe given the cue across participants and built a diffusion model to estimate how the cue informs participants’ priors for the decision. We found that participants’ context-dependent priors were closer to each other and less extreme than those predicted by a model that maximizes reward rate given the true stimulus frequencies. However, participants’ priors were optimal given their subjective frequency estimates, which showed that they averaged response probabilities across cues when the cues made sufficiently similar predictions.",>Olga Lositsky>Michael Shvartsman>Robert C.

Sixty-five Chinese-speaking children between the ages of 4 and 6 recruited in Taiwan participated in the experiment. The results indicate that children can make generalization based on their understanding of classifiers instead of solely relying on classifier-noun associations. The results also show that the participants performed equally on both shape-based and feature-shared classifiers, which suggests that children not only use shape salience to learn Chinese classifiers, but are also sensitive to other relations between objects classified by the same Chinese classifier. Besides, the complex patterns in the results imply that in spite of the exposure to classifiers, the semantic transparency between classifiers and objects varies considerably in both semantic types of classifier, which might be the primary reason that some classifiers are more difficult for children to acquire.",>Yu-Han Luo>Jon-Fan Hu,">National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan, R.O.C>National Cheng Kung Univeristy, Tainan City, Taiwan, R.O.C",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0790/index.html
2017,Cumulative response probabilities: Estimating time course of lexical activation from single-point response times,"An aim of research on spoken word recognition is to characterize the influence of various lexical characteristics (e.g., word frequency, neighborhood size) on lexical access. Dynamics can be coarsely estimated from single-point measures like naming or more directly assessed using time course measures like fixation proportions over time in the visual world paradigm (e.g., Tanenhaus et al., 1995). We propose that cumulative response probabilities (CRPs) over time may allow a new characterization of the activation dynamics of lexical access from single-point measures. We assume that the timing of responses in a naming task reflects probabilistic sampling of underlying continuous activation dynamics that can be recovered by CRPs. We applied CRP analyses to visual word recognition data collected for 40,481 words from 472 participants (the English Lexicon Project; Balota et al., 2007) and report initial efforts to validate this new approach.",>Sahil Luthra>James Magnuson,">University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, USA>University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0791/index.html

In a pre-registered study, we developed and administered an immigration IAT to readers of the Daily Mail (typically anti-immigration) and Guardian (typically pro-immigration) newspapers. IAT Materials were constructed based on co-occurrence frequencies from each newspapers' website for immigration-related terms (migrant) and positive/negative attributes (skilled/unskilled). Target stimuli showed stronger negative associations with immigration concepts in the Daily Mail corpus compared to the Guardian corpus, and stronger positive associations in the Guardian corpus compared to the Daily Mail. Consistent with these linguistic distributional differences, Daily Mail readers exhibited a larger IAT bias, revealing stronger negative associations to immigration concepts compared to Guardian readers. This difference in overall bias was not explained by other variables, and raises the possibility that exposure to biased language contributes to biased implicit attitudes.",>Dermot Lynott>Michael Walsh>Tony McEnery>Louise Connell>Liam Cross,">Lancaster University, UK>University of Stuttgart, Germany>Lancaster University, UK>Lancaster University, UK>University of Buckingham, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0792/index.html
2017,How and when does the syllable become a reading unit? Developmental evidence in French children,"French beginning readers might rely on syllables during reading acquisition. However, no in-depth developmental study has been carried out to determine how and when the syllable becomes this prelexical and segmental unit used in the time course of reading acquisition. We recruited 800 French-speaking children distributed in grade 1-5. We used a lexical decision task in a visual masked priming paradigm and a visual identification task. We manipulated the initial syllable frequency, the initial bi/trigram frequency, and the initial syllable structure (CV; CVC). Our main results describe a clear developmental course. The syllable-based effects are early (G1) and sustainably observed (G5), and primarily depend on the syllable frequency. From G2, we found the systematic, automatic use of the syllable as prelexical and segmental unit but the syllable frequency has facilitatory syllable-based effects in the task with lexical access, while it has inhibitory effects in the task without lexical access.",>Norbert Maïonchi-Pino>Virginie Loiseau,">Université Clermont Auvergne - LAPSCO - CNRS UMR 6024, Clermont-Ferrand, France>Université Clermont Auvergne - LAPSCO - CNRS UMR 6024, Clermont-Ferrand, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0793/index.html
2017,Epistemically Suspect Beliefs can be partly explained by individual’s propensity towards contradiction,"Studies on epistemically suspect beliefs (ESB) have suggested that individual’s analytic cognition suppresses unwarranted beliefs, however, our previous studies also showed that an inhibitory effect of analytic cognition was higher among Westerners than Easterners. Rather, intuitive cognition was a common predictor of beliefs between two cultures. Among several cultural differences in cognitive style, we suspect that tendency towards dialectic thinking, i.e., tolerance for contradiction may contribute cultural differences on ESB. The present study aimed to explore this possibility and investigated the association between beliefs and other cognitive measures including individual’s cognitive abilities, thinking dispositions, personality traits and propensity towards dialectic thinking. The results showed that the ESB resulted from our intuitive cognition for the most part, and that the effect of culture diminished whilst controlling individual’s tendency towards dialectic thinking and style of causal cognition.

2017,Practicing an auditory working memory task recruits lower-level auditory areas in a task-specific manner,"We studied the impact of the trained auditory task on the pattern of behavioural improvement, and its relation to the underlying neural mechanisms. Specifically, we asked whether training with tone retention and manipulation (working memory, WM) transferred to pitch discrimination and vice versa, and whether training modified the brain areas that underlie task performance. Training substantially improved performance, but did not transfer across tasks, even when using the same stimuli. Pre and post training fMRI scans revealed that WM training enhanced activity in bilateral auditory cortices, but not in frontal areas that are initially associated with higher cognitive functions. These results suggest that training-induced improvement is associated with back-tracking along the reverse hierarchy in a task specific manner, as predicted by the Reverse Hierarchy Theory of perceptual learning (Ahissar & Hochstein, 2004). Thus, low-level areas are recruited, but there is no general upgrade in WM or in auditory skills.",>Tamar Malinovitch>Philippe Albouy>Merav Ahissar>Robert Zatorre,">Hebrew University of Jerusalem>Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal>Hebrew University of Jerusalem>Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0795/index.html
2017,Do Relationality and Aptness Influence Conventionalization?,"The conventionalization of figurative comparisons is one source of lexical evolution. For example, anchor once only meant a device for mooring a ship, but may now be used to describe any source of stability or confidence. Our goal is to understand this process. Following the Career of Metaphor framework, figurative mappings are interpreted through a structure-mapping process, rendering common structure salient. As figurative terms become conventionalized, (1) the figurative sense becomes associated with the base term; and (2) there is shift from simile form to metaphor form. In two studies we investigated psycholinguistic properties that may influence this process: relationality and aptness. We use relative preference for the metaphor form as an estimate of degree of conventionalization; by determining the preferred form for a set of figuratives, we find evidence that both aptness and relationality influence this process. We speculate that figurative comparisons may give rise to new relational terms.",>Francisco Maravilla>Dedre Gentner,">Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States>Northwestern University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0796/index.html
2017,Mutual Exclusivity Revisited – When Pragmatics overrides Novelty,"Children typically apply a novel label to a novel object, rather than to a familiar object; a phenomenon called Mutual Exclusivity (Markman et al., 2003). A recent explanation is that children tend to associate novel stimuli together (Horst et al., 2011). We show that pragmatic factors may override novelty. In our study two-year-old children first played with a novel object together with E1. Then E1 left the room and E2 brought another three novel objects for the child to manipulate on his/her own. Finally, E1 came back and requested the child to give her the ‘Bitye’. Most children chose the first object, with which they had a common history with E1, even though it was the least novel. This suggests that children understand a novel word by considering to which object the speaker is most likely to have intended to refer.",>Hanna Marno>Dan Sperber,">Central European University, Budapest, Hungary>Central European University, Budapest, Hungary; Institut Nicod, Paris, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0797/index.html

All existing self-report measures are based solely on recognized emotions. To understand the influence of recalled emotions, we developed a new method to recover human emotional states based on emotional free association, in a task we call the emotional fluency. The present work investigated the differences between recall and recognition in human emotional states. We compared the emotional fluency task with self-report measures, including PANAS, WEMWBS, and the Emotional Intelligence Scale. Using language statistics computed from the emotional fluency task, we developed multiple models for predicting self-report measures. We find that while recalled emotions can predict recognized emotions, they highlight important problems with existing recognition measures, including emotional coverage and the difference between availability and accessibility.

In the current study, we asked 10- and 12-year-old children to look at two columns of numbers (framed as the distances two golfers drove a golf ball, when doing so repeatedly), and to choose which golfer hit the ball farther. We examined reaction time, accuracy, and eye movements, in addition to self-reported strategy use. We found children reasoned using some of the same summary characteristics as adults, though less consistently, and had more varied strategy uses. For example, some children focused only on one number in each set, a pattern not seen in adults. These findings suggest that instruction building on these intuitions may help develop children’s numerical cognition skills.",>Amy Masnick>Bradley Morris>Christopher Was,">Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, US>Kent State University, Kent, Ohio, USA>Kent State University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0799/index.html
2017,Attention Modulation Effects on Visual Feature-selectivity of Neurons in Brain-inspired Categorization Models,"Most Brain-inspired Visual Object Recognition Models(BVORMs) do not consider local and global reciprocal connections in visual pathway. We addressed this weakness and implemented an attention modulation mechanism based on feedback connections in BVORMs, where feature-selectivity is shaped and modulated by categorization of objects based on their visual features. This modification is inspired by the top-down neuromodulatory signals that make changes in post-synaptic activities of the feature-selective neurons. We also incorporated an implicit memory unit in BVORMs to accumulate recent Hebbian synaptic plasticity’s of the neurons in each task. This mechanism guides the top-down feature-based attention modulation to retrieve the interrelated feature-selectivity pattern for each task.HMax and CNN models were used as two BVORMs and tested on a visual categorization problem: natural versus artificial objects in CALTECH-256.

2017,Simple and Complex Working Memory Tasks Allow Similar Benefits of Information Compression,"Because complex span tasks were designed to create a demanding concurrent task, the average span is usually lower (4 ± 1 items) than in simple span tasks (7 ± 2 items). One possible reason for the higher span of simple span tasks is that participants can take profit of the spare time to chunk a few stimuli into 4 ± 1 groups. It follows that the respective spans of these two types of tasks could be equal (at around 4 ± 1) when regularities are absent. We therefore predicted an interaction between task and chunkability, supporting a single higher span for a simple span task using chunkable items. However, observation of the spans in the non-chunkable vs. chunkable series refuted the idea that chunking is important solely in simple spans. Indeed, information compression processes contributed to performance levels to a similar extent in simple and complex span tasks.",>fabien mathy>mustapha chekaf>Nelson Cowan,">Université Côte d'Azur>Université Côte d'Azur>University of Missouri, Columbia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0801/index.html
2017,Causal asymmetry and the intuitive physics of collision events,"In the Michotte (1963) launching scenario, an object (X) moves toward a resting object (Y), eventually colliding with it. In the moment of contact, X stops und Y starts moving - creating the strong impression that X caused Y’s motion and that X exerted a force on Y (but not vice versa). These asymmetries contradict the (symmetrical) laws of Newtonian mechanics, which are at the heart of the popular “noisy Newton” theories of intuitive physics. As an alternative, we propose that inferences in physical scenarios operate over pre-Newtonian representations that are based on the asymmetrical concept of impetus, a motive force that keeps objects moving and that is transferred and reflected in object collisions. We present a formal model of impetus and show that, unlike noisy Newton theories, it provides an explanation of asymmetrical judgments. Other related findings can also be modeled (e.g., biases in mass judgments).",>Ralf Mayrhofer>Michael Waldmann,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0802/index.html
2017,The development of interpersonal regret and its relation to prosocial choice,"We examined whether children feel regret when their failure to make a prosocial choice negatively affects a peer. Five-to-six-year-olds and 7-to-9-year-olds played a game in which they completed a sticker sheet to win a prize. Children then decided whether to donate a spare sticker to another child; most children did not donate. Children discovered that the next child did not have enough stickers to win a prize, and rated their emotions. At this point, children did not know whether the next child could have been able to win the prize if they had donated the sticker in question. This counterfactual information was then provided, and children rated whether they felt happier, sadder, or the same as before. Only the 7-to-9-year-olds’ responses suggested that they experienced interpersonal regret. We also showed that experiencing interpersonal regret in the sticker task resulted in children making more prosocial choices in a separate task.",>Teresa McCormack>Brian Uprichard,>Queen's University Belfast>Queen's University Belfast,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0803/index.html
2017,"Interactive and embodied repair: Displaying, recognizing, and negotiating misalignment in an emerging language context","As problems of understanding arise in conversational interaction, we must find a means to indicate to our interlocutor the reason for our misunderstanding. However, we are simultaneously constrained by social interactive practices that limit face threat and adhere to epistemic rights. Thus, the challenge is to communicate our own misunderstanding - as specifically as possible - while avoiding explicitness. This challenge may be increased in contexts of language emergence in which alignment is necessary to promote communicative efficiency and conventionalization. Participants in novel communication tasks relied on certain gesture-driven other-initiated repair strategies to gain interactive alignment.

2017,Misalignment increases abstraction of referring expressions,"A central finding in dialogue research is that interlocutors rapidly converge on referring expressions which become progressively contracted and abstract. However there is currently no consensus on which mechanisms underpin convergence: The interactive alignment model (Pickering and Garrod, 2009) favours alignment processes, the grounding model (Clark, 1996) prioritizes positive feedback, while Healey (2002) demonstrates the importance of miscommunication in identifying differences of interpretation. To investigate convergence we report a variant of the maze-task in which both participants are given misaligned instructions: One participant is primed with instructions that conceptualize the maze as consisting of horizontal vectors (e.g .""4th row, 2nd square""); the other is primed with instructions that conceptualize the maze as consisting of vertical vectors (e.g .""3rd column, 2nd square""). Compared with a baseline, misaligned dyads converged on more abstract referring expressions. We argue this pattern is due to participants interactively combining their perspective with that of their partner.",>Gregory Mills>Gisela Redeker,">University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands>University of Groningen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0805/index.html
2017,The spontaneous creation of systems of conventions,"We used a non-linguistic experimental paradigm to explore the instantaneous creation and adaption of novel communicative systems of conventions. Groups of participants played a computer game, in which they sent and interpreted minimal signals to obtain shared rewards within a virtual scene. Within groups, trials manipulated the space of possible signals that could be sent, and the set of meanings to be expressed (the range of cases for the locations and quantities of rewards). Between groups, initial conditions were manipulated through early exposure to different sets of communicative cases. We observed participants spontaneously develop systems of conventions that were adapted to the full range of signal-meaning mappings encountered. Groups favoured systems optimised to their particular initial learning environment. These systems become entrenched and transferred to new signal-mapping environments to which they were not adapted.",>Jennifer Misyak>Nick Chater,">University of Warwick, Coventry, UK>University of Warwick, Coventry, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0806/index.html
2017,Refining the cognitive semantic web: The tensor method to represent the topographic emplacement of different word categories,"A central problem concerning the organization of the cognitive semantic web is to understand how different categories of words are stored in the brain with a well-defined topographical organization. This topography is a natural construction that plausibly is strongly related with the syntactic and semantic organization of natural languages. An eloquent experimental evidence of the existence of a continuous semantic representation of object and action categories in the human brain has been published by Huth et al (Neuron 76:1210, 2012). One of the ways to explain the emergence of a topographical organization in the brain cortex using neurocomputational models, is by means of Kohonen’s self-organizing maps. Here we show that these topographies can be operationally represented with associative memories spatially organized by tensor contexts. We illustrate formally and numerically this fact. In addition, we show that, consistently with evidence from pathology, different semantic categories can be specifically damaged.",>Eduardo Mizraji>Andrés Pomi,">Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay>Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0807/index.html
2017,Picture book reading in the lives of 18-30 month old children: A diary study,"Picture book reading is a common activity in the lives of many children. This work describes the frequency and character of picture book reading in American homes. Seventy-seven monolingual English-speaking families with children between the ages of 18-30 months took part in a 5-day diary study in which caregivers recorded details about picture book reading activities. This sample is characteristic of some laboratory samples but less nationally representative; 92.2% of caregivers held a college degree. Relative to previously reported averages, caregivers reported reading to children more often (6.8x/day), reported beginning reading at a younger age (2.2 months) and reported more books in the home (111.1 books). Caregivers reported both reading the book text and discussing the pictures with their children. These numbers suggest an extremely high upper-limit to the amount of language input some children receive from picture book reading. Consequences for language environments and language development will be discussed.",>Jessica Montag>Linda Smith,">University of California, Riverside>Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0808/index.html
2017,Resemblance among similarity measures in semantic representation,"Similarity measures, extent to which two concepts have similar meanings, are key to understanding how concepts are represented, with different theoretical perspectives relying on very different sources of data from which similarity can be calculated. Experiential/embodied theories use verbal features or property ratings; distributional/relational ones use co-occurrence. Similarity may also be estimated from tasks like word-association, priming, and other rating studies. Often the different theoretical perspectives are placed in opposition; here we test the extent to which similarity representations based on different measures converge. We used Representational Similarity Analysis and multidimensional scaling on 31 similarity measures. Similarity in age-of-acquisition and word-length were related to similarity in naming and priming; and affective similarity and co-occurrence were also related. More importantly, representational resemblance was shown among embodied, distributional and association-based representations, demonstrating that different data sources are employed in a similar way in building meaningful conceptual representation.",>Maria Montefinese>David Vinson,">Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London, London, UK>Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London, London, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0809/index.html
2017,Effects of Question Format on Test-Taker Cognition,"Technology-based, interactive test questions are common in large-scale assessments, yet how alternative question formats influence test-taker cognition is not well understood. In a series of studies, we investigated test-taker performance on isomorphic questions using alternative presentation layouts and modes of responding. Adult participants solved math problems in three formats, each of which regularly appear in many large-scale assessments: 1) forced-choice (explicit True-False options) presented in a table format, 2) check-all-that-apply (implicit True-False options) presented in a table format, and 3) check-all-that apply presented as separate questions. Participants’ solution time and affirmative selection rate suggested different cognitive processes for the question formats, particularly when they were uncertain of their answers. We propose a cognitive model to account for the results and predict the impact of alternative question formats on test-takers. We discuss how principles of cognitive science and human-computer interaction provide direct implications for designing assessment questions and understanding test-taker cognition.",>Jung Aa Moon>Irvin Katz>Madeleine Keehner,>Educational Testing Service>Educational Testing Service>Educational Testing Service,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0810/index.html
2017,Magnitude of metaphor and its effect on reasoning about immigration,"Metaphor is replete in discourse about immigration. Recent work shows that metaphoric framing can influence attitudes toward immigration (e.g., Landau et al., 2009). However, we know little about how and when specific information in the source domain drives this effect. Our study takes a novel approach, examining how varying intensity of information in the source domain frame influences attitudes toward immigrants and immigration in the U.S. We analyze various metaphors but we focus especially on intensity effects in the conceptual metaphor IMMIGRATION IS FLUID TRANSFER. For the FLUID TRANSFER source domain, we investigate how varying intensity of flow (e.g., rate) influences attitudes about immigration, including whether immigrants should have access to social services and what type of wall should be built, if at all. Our results make a valuable contribution to metaphor research by revealing what information within the source domain has the most (or least) robust effects on reasoning.",>Karie Moorman>Teenie Matlock,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0811/index.html
2017,Investigating the Impact of Sleep on Eyewitness Memory,"How sleep impacts the accuracy of identifications that eyewitnesses make from lineups is unknown. For a comprehensive understanding of eyewitness performance, two types of eyewitness ID accuracy are considered: discriminability (the ability to distinguish innocent from guilty suspects) and reliability (the probability that the identified suspect was the offender). The well-known role sleep plays in memory consolidation should apply to an eyewitness’s ability to discriminate, but not necessarily their reliability. That is what we investigated in a large-scale forensically-relevant experiment. We compared discriminability and reliability from sleep (sleep occurs between witnessing a crime and lineup test) and wake (remains awake between crime and lineup) conditions. Furthermore, theorists have long been using signal-detection models to understand recognition memory, but its use is new to the field of eyewitness ID research. Thus, we compared signal-detection models with different decision rules. Our findings shed light on the impact sleep has on eyewitness IDs.",>David Morgan>Jakke Tamminen>Laura Mickes,">Royal Holloway, University of London>Royal Holloway, University of London>Royal Holloway, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0812/index.html
2017,Impact of testimony and prior knowledge on children’s beliefs about category homogeneity,"Previous work has shown that preschoolers—in comparison to older children and adults—tend to view categories as homogeneous, generalizing properties of individuals broadly to all category members (e.g., this dax has wings, so all daxes do). Here, we explore whether the testimony used to describe category individuals as well as children’s prior knowledge of categories attenuates their homogeneity expectations. Using a novel induction task, 4 to 7-year-olds were asked to predict the distribution of properties among members of familiar/unfamiliar animal categories based on a single exemplar. Exemplars were introduced as “special” to half of participants. Preliminary findings (N = 71) suggest that prior knowledge may contribute to beliefs about category homogeneity: responses for familiar animals varied appropriately given the real-world prevalence of each property whereas children overestimated the property’s prevalence for unfamiliar animals. The complete dataset will speak to how language choice in testimony shifts children’s beliefs about homogeneity.",>Kelsey Moty>Amanda Brandone,>Lehigh University>Lehigh University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0813/index.html
2017,Learning to Consider Alternative Causes: Can Practice Make Us More Aware of Our Imperfection?,"In hindsight bias, upon learning an outcome, one is overly confident that one would have “known it all along.” Several researchers have been able to neutralize hindsight bias by prompting participants to consider alternative outcomes, but can we learn to avoid bias for novel outcomes, without prompting? Foresight participants read brief summaries of five psychology studies, and learned the mean performance of one group in each study. They estimated the other group’s performance—reflecting their sense of the effect size—stated possible causes, and then learned the other group’s mean performance. Hindsight participants learned both groups’ mean performance at the outset, then indicated what they would have estimated. We asked whether (1) participants would show superior estimation and/or consideration of alternative causes for novel stimuli one week later, and (2) whether Foresight participants would benefit more given the feedback they received on the accuracy of their estimates.",>Edward Munnich>Ana Maria Hoffmann>Nancy Ortega>Emma Weinberger>Dana-Lis Bittner>Jacqueline Tiongco>Jasmine West,>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco>University of San Francisco,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0814/index.html
2017,Bidirectional effect of emotional contagion for pain during face-to-face interaction,"The automatic contagion of emotion is considered crucial in interpersonal communication. In face-to-face interactions, people could be both the receiver and sender of emotional content. Thus, contagion may have bidirectional influences on the emotional states of individuals. However, many studies have mainly dealt with unidirectional contagion, such that the expression of pain in a target entails a reaction of pain in the observer. In this study, we demonstrated bidirectional emotional contagion in the experience of thermal pain during interaction. Firstly, we showed that the physiological responses of dyad members were correlated with each other when they could interact compared to when they were impaired to see each other. Further, we demonstrated that individuals showed higher or lower physiological responses when their partners experienced stronger or weaker stimuli respectively. Thus, people can develop similar physiological responses through interactions, and this effect seems to induce a change in the responsivity to stimuli.",>Aiko Murata>Tatsuya Kameda>Katsumi Watanabe,>Waseda University>The University of Tokyo>Waseda University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0815/index.html
2017,Agent’s symmetry elicits egocentric transformations for spatial perspective-taking,"Spatial perspective-taking is an ability to understand in which direction an object is located relative to an agent (e.g., another person or a chair). Previous studies showed that left/right judgments prompted an egocentric transformation strategy (i.e., mental rotation of the self) whereas front/behind judgments prompted other strategies (e.g., tracing a line of sight). To examine whether the symmetrical shape of an agent could affect the choice of strategies, we used as an agent a cuboid which has a prong on one of its sides. We labeled the prong side as the front (Experiment 1) or right (Experiment 2) of the agent, about which participants made left/right and front/behind judgments. The results revealed that egocentric transformations were more favored for judgments about directions along symmetrical than asymmetrical axes of the agent, regardless of whether the judgment was about left/right or front/behind. This suggests similar processing underlies left/right and front/behind judgments.",>Hiroyuki Muto>Soyogu Matsushita>Kazunori Morikawa,">Graduate School of Human Sciences, Osaka University

To be a moral agent is to bear its own responsibility which others cannot take for it. We will argue that such an irreplaceability consists in its having an inner world --- one which others cannot directly experience, just as pleasure and pain. And personality of a moral agent, which is to be irreducible to a mere difference of traits or features of individuals, is firmly rooted in such an inner world. We will support our theses by referring to our experiment in which humans and robots interact with each other doing a coordination task. This experiment will provide an empirical analysis of the human-robot relationship with regard to learning mechanism, moral judgement, and the ascription of the inner world.",>Shoji Nagataki>Masayoshi Shibata>Tatsuya Kashiwabata>Takashi Hashimoto>Takeshi Konno>Hideki Ohira>Toshihiko Miura>Shinichi Kubota,>Chukyo University>Kanazawa University>Keio University>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Kanazawa Institute of Technology>Nagoya University>University of Tokyo>Kanazawa University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0817/index.html
2017,Iconicity vs. Systematicity in Artificial Language Learning,"A foundational assumption in linguistics has been that words and their meanings are arbitrarily related; however, this position has been challenged recently. Experiments have shown that both systematic (where similar objects have similar labels) and iconic (words ‘resemble’ the objects they label) associations between words and objects facilitate learning. However, these two literatures remain confounded: the degree to which increased learnability is driven by iconicity rather than systematicity has not been disentangled. Here we present the results of two studies testing the differences in learnability between artificial lexica that are either conventionally systematic, or both systematic and cross-modally iconic. In the first study we find that both conventional and iconic systematic lexicons are equally learnable, but iconic mappings provide an early learnability advantage. In the second study we find that the presence of sound-symbolic associations for one dimension can interfere with the learning of conventional associations on another dimension.",>Alan Ks Nielsen>Julia Simner>Simon Kirby>Kenny Smith,>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>University of Sussex>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0818/index.html
2017,"The space and time of contamination: Complete, continual, spreading effects","People sometimes report feeling “totally” different (complete affectedness) and that “they’ll never be the same again” (continual affectedness) after negative events. It’s been proposed that complete, and continual negative effects characterize contamination or impurity. Meanwhile, whether impurity is a legitimate moral domain apart from harm has been debated in moral psychology. We address these matters using novel approaches from cognitive linguistics. First, according to a prominent theory of verb semantics, verbs that convey impurity (contaminate, taint) belong to a class that implies complete affectedness (the “fill” class), such that contaminated entities are seen as completely contaminated. Second, people rated perpetrators equally, and highly, “contaminated”, “contaminating”, and “injuring”, whereas victims were rated straightforwardly “injured” (Turk; n=126, replicated twice). For ""contaminated"" perpetrators, the taint carried on -- they were continually ""contaminating"". In sum, impurity is distinct from harm: the process underlying impurity, contamination, involves inferences of complete, continual negative effects that spread.",>Laura Niemi>Liane Young,">Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA>Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0819/index.html

In order to support the users of such tools who are untrained in design, it is necessary to develop a support system that makes it possible to use expert knowledge on designing products. For this study, we selected 26 items from the values that are considered important for design (e.g., unique, modern; Inomata et al., 2016), and investigated the design activities for realizing these values. Eighty professionals in design participated in the survey. Many design activities concerning shapes and colors were observed as ways to realize the values.

2017,Indirection Explains Flexible Tuning of Neurons in Prefrontal Cortex,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is broadly seen as supporting cognitive flexibility - quickly adapting behavior in response to changing circumstances. Some PFC neurons appear to actively maintain rule-like information associated with the current task, with firing changing with task context. Some PFC neurons, however, have been found to exhibit activity related to specific stimulus features or action options, but the tuning of these neurons appears to dynamically change with task shifts (Duncan, 2001). Short-term synaptic plasticity has been proposed as the primary mechanism for rapidly adapting the response profiles of these cells. Using a computational cognitive neuroscience model of hierarchical structure in PFC (Kriete, Noelle, Cohen, & O'Reilly, 2013), an alternative account is offered in which flexible neural tuning arises not from fast synaptic change but from a frontal representational scheme involving neurons that encode references to other PFC areas rather than directly encoding task relevant sensory/motor information.",>David Noelle,">University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0821/index.html
2017,Five-Year-Old Children Transfer a Metacognitive Strategy to a Novel Task,"Previous work has demonstrated that interventions like 1) giving in-the-moment performance feedback and 2) providing a strategy rule can improve children’s metacognitive learning. However, there is little evidence to suggest that this learning transfers to a novel task. We trained 5-year-olds’ metacognitive control in a task requiring participants to select the easier of two games to acquire the highest amount of points. Compared to a control group who received no training, children who were trained to control behavior (by selecting an easier dot discrimination task) showed greater evidence of transfer to a novel task (by selecting an easier line length discrimination task). This suggests that the learned strategy rule (i.e., to select an easier task) was not stimulus-specific, and was abstract enough to apply to a novel task with new stimuli. In sum, 5-year-olds were able to learn a strategy rule and spontaneously apply the strategy to a novel task.",>Allison O'Leary>Vladimir Sloutsky,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0822/index.html
2017,Do forgiving God primes strengthen support for state sanctioned punishment?,"Do forgiving God primes strengthen support for state-sanctioned punishment? Laurin et al (2012) found that beliefs in powerful, intervening Gods (both in general and when made salient) reduce people’s endorsement of state-sanctioned punishment. In light of this, we investigated whether the manner in which God intervenes (via forgiveness or punishment) influences people’s endorsement of state-sanctioned punishment. Across four studies we explored a) whether priming participants with a forgiving God and b) whether salient, forgiving God beliefs increase endorsements of state-sanctioned punishment. The rationale being that a forgiving God will lead people to view punishment as a responsibility that lies with them rather than one outsourced to God. Our results revealed no evidence for effects of forgiving God primes or salient forgiving god beliefs on endorsements of state-sanctioned punishment.

2017,Anticipatory Active Inference from Learned Recurrent Neural Forward Models,"We demonstrate that inference-based goal-directed behavior can be done by utilizing the temporal gradients in recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN learns a dynamic sensorimotor forward model. Once the RNN is trained, it can be used to execute active-inference-based, goal-directed policy optimization. The internal neural activities of the trained RNN essentially model the predictive state of the controlled entity. The implemented optimization process projects the neural activities into the future via the RNN recurrences following a tentative sequence of motor commands (encoded in neurons akin to recurrent parametric biases). This sequence is adapted by back-projecting the error between the forward-projected hypothetical states and desired (goal-like) system states onto the motor commands. Few cycles of forward projection and goal-based error backpropagation yield the sequences of motor commands that control the dynamical systems. As an example, we show that a trained RNN model can be used to effectively control a quadrocopter-like system.",>Sebastian Otte>Theresa Schmitt>Martin V.

Scientific knowledge about the brain is extensive, but there is still a lot to be understood about its functions. Cognitive functions are weakened in dyslexic children; this is reflected in highly individual problems regarding the reading skills. Reading is a process which consists of decrypting graphic characters (perceptual level) and understanding the meaning of words (cognitive level). These levels cannot be separated. An approach – fuzzy logic – is used in order to address this issue and create a model of the dyslexic user, based on which technologies can be individually tailored to a particular dyslexic. We discusse the possibilities of the use of the mathematical apparatus for the categorisation of users with regard to their ""black box"".

The small-scale intervention includes eight 30-minute sessions over 6 weeks, in groups of five children. Each session included: (1) shared storybook reading; (2) role-playing; and (3) review. During shared story-book reading the children were read two books with explicit phonological awareness and vocabulary instruction for 18 words in each book. Role-playing included providing the children with props, which allow for engagement in pretend play activities. Several measures were used pre- and post-intervention to evaluate children’s self- regulation and language skills.

Bayes factor analyses on these statistics indicated that the support of these results for the null-hypothesis is strong only in 4%, moderate in 70% and anecdotal in 26%. The results revealed that Bayes factor analysis can help researchers in interpreting nonsignificant results and also highlight that psychological studies with traditional sample sizes are unlikely to present strong evidence for the null-hypothesis.",>Bence Palfi>Aba Szollosi>Barnabas Szaszi>Marton Kovacs>Mark Zrubka>Peter Szecsi>Balazs Aczel>Eric-Jan Wagenmakers,">University of Sussex, Falmer, United King>University of New South Wales>Eotvos Lorand University>Eotvos Lorand University>Eotvos Lorand University>Eotvos Lorand University>Eotvos Lorand University>University of Amsterdam",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0828/index.html

Bounded rationality, or the idea that we are limited by the amount cognitive work we can perform, provides an appealing framework within which perceived control could be formulated. When modeling the world, the bounded-rational agent balances the trade-off between the utility and complexity of this constructed model in order to choose an optimal policy. Here, we present a novel formulation of behavioral control, bounded inference, which explicitly models control as the perceived constraint experienced by an agent during the inference process, employing a version of the free energy functional with an additional boundedness parameter as the variational principle of this constrained optimization. The utility of bounded inference is demonstrated in simulations that capture various characteristics of dysfunctional behavioral patterns as observed in a range of psychiatric disorders for which control beliefs play a central role.",>Saee Paliwal>Frederike Petzschner>Ekaterina Lomakina>Klaas Enno Stephan,">Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU), Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Zurich, Switzerland>Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU), Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Zurich, Switzerland>Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU), Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Zurich, Switzerland>Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU), Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Zurich, Switzerland",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0829/index.html

To address this challenge, this work leverages well-replicated cognitive science phenomena to promote people’s understanding of research found in journal articles. It forms the conceptual groundwork for a digital platform through which users can author and learn from interactive multimedia documents that communicate research more effectively. One of the many recommendations is to reduce the split-attention effect by integrating text and graphics in figures. Doing so may help readers understand complex visuospatial representations. Encouraging active processing via comprehension questions and responsive simulations of experimental procedures embedded in articles may boost learning even more. To promote the creative extension of research, evidence-based brainstorming prompts that trigger analogical reasoning and episodic specificity induction should be adopted.

Despite the widespread interest in metacognitive skills and their development, it is challenging to measure metacognitive skills in children. Some excellent qualitative and observational measures exist, but use metrics that are different from traditional metacognition tasks for adults. Some meta-cognition tasks of memory have been developed for children, but these only offer a narrow range of the skills involved in metacognition. Here, we compared performance on a meta-memory task for children with a new task of metacognition for problem solving. Our sample includes about 800 children aged 8-10 years who were part of a larger study exploring the development of thinking skills.

Kindergarten and university students completed symbolic and non-symbolic magnitude comparison tasks and a math skill measure. For children and adults, we calculated Chronbach’s $\alpha$ separately for each presentation format. All values were in the unacceptable range, indicating that the different indices were not measuring the same construct. For children, a multiple regression predicting KeyMath scores from symbolic and non-symbolic indices showed that only non-symbolic overall accuracy and symbolic overall RT were predictors.

This word gap predicts later school readiness outcomes and sets the stage for achievement gaps that can follow the child through life. Although parent speech has become a subject of increasing study and intervention, less is known about speech in childcare settings. We conducted a longitudinal study in an early-intervention classroom for 2-3-year-old children from low-income, at-risk backgrounds. We examine the relationship between language input from teachers and peers and children’s language skills over one year. Results show that vocabulary knowledge influences children’s talkativeness in the classroom, and talkativeness and the amount of language they hear positively relates to increases in their language abilities. Our application of automated measurement provides new insight into the dynamics of the classroom language environment and consequences for language development in at-risk children.",>Lynn Perry>Emily Prince>Adriana Valtierra>Camila Rivero-Fernández>Mary Anne Ullery>Lynne Katz>Daniel Messinger,">University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States>University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States>University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States>University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States>University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States>University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States>University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0833/index.html
2017,"Early Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) in Infant Siblings of Children with ASD, ADHD and Age-Matched Controls","Atypicalities in sensory perception are observed in individuals diagnosed with ASD and ADHD but have rarely been contrasted in experimental studies. In the visual domain, superior performance on visual search tasks and hypersensitivity to flickering lights have been cited as evidence of unusual sensory profiles. To measure a reliable visual response, black-and-white checkerboards were presented under free-viewing conditions to three groups of 10-month-olds: siblings of children with ASD (N=47), ADHD (N=21) and controls (N=18). Continuous EEG was recorded and VEPs time-locked to checkerboards presentation computed. Analysis of VEPs amplitude and latency revealed statistically significant group differences in the first 200ms post-stimulus onset. Early components were enhanced in amplitude (P100) and delayed in latency (P100-N100) in at-risk infants compared to controls (p<.05). Atypical VEPs to low-level information might index a domain-general aberration in at-risk populations. The nature of this atypicality will be further investigated by analyzing its association with background EEG.",>Elena Serena Piccardi>Mark H.

2017,How does social touch modulate arousal states? An investigation in early development.,"Caregiver-infant interaction through touch was shown to have long-term effects on child's cognitive development, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Our aim is to investigate how affective touch (slow gentle caressing) affects arousal states in young infants. Previous work showed that slow-touch decreases heart rate in 9-month-old infants. We tested two groups of 6-months-old (n=26) and 9-months-old infants (n=23). We measured heart rate and saccadic reaction time while infants performed a visual orienting task, where speed of re-orienting from a central fixation to a peripheral target was measured. During the experiment, infants received either slow or fast-touch on their back in blocked trials. We found no effects of touch on heart rate in either age-group, and only marginal effects of slow-touch on reaction times in 9-month-old infants. We are currently testing 2 months-old infants to investigate if these effects are observed earlier in life; these new results will be discussed.",>Laura Pirazzoli>Emily Jones>Teodora Gliga>Mark H.

2017,"Hand, spoon or toothbrush? Towards the understanding of the neural underpinnings of affective touch in 5 months-old infants.","It is known that affective touch leads to broad cortical activations including posterior STS, key region of the social brain. Our goal is to discover if a similar pattern of activation can be observed in 5-months-old infants, or whether the development of this cortical specialization results from extensive postnatal experience. Over two studies we used functional-Near-InfraRed-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to compare social touch (a human caress) to non-social touch (a caress performed with a spoon in study1 -n=22- or with an electric toothbrush in study2 -n=17-). In study1 we found similar patterns of activation to the social and non-social stimulus. In study2 we report broad responses to the non-social stimulus, but, to our surprise, we found no activations to the human caress. In light of these results we conclude that it is possible that at this age discrimination between social and non-social touch in the posterior temporal lobe is still undergoing specialization.",>Laura Pirazzoli>Sarah Lloyd-Fox>Mark H.

2017,Do we see things better when we know grammar?,"Language affects perception. But how? Recent findings (Boutonnet & Lupyan, 2015; Bocanegra, Poletiek & Zwaan, submitted) suggest a dissociation between perception that is mediated as compared to not mediated by language. One explanation is that language –that is combinatorial in nature- stresses the separate features of objects. We investigated the effect of combinatorial (two words) and non-combinatorial (one word) labels on the perceptual separation of features in visual recognition. Participants were trained to categorize meaningless objects with two dimensions: shape and height. Each category had either a one word name; or a two words name reflecting its features. Participants then were tested on new objects . Combinatorial labels enhanced categorization performance as compared to single labels. This suggests that language, by decomposing objects into parts, might drive dimension separation in vision as well.",>Fenna Poletiek>Maartje Van de Velde,>Leiden University>Leiden University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0837/index.html
2017,Patterns of Cortical Activation Correlate With Speech Understanding After Cochlear Implantation,"Cochlear implantation is a standard intervention for deafness, yet the ability of implanted patients to understand speech varies widely. To better understand this variability, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to image auditory cortex activation in response to different classes of sound and compared that to behavioral measures of speech perception. Both control and implanted participants with good speech perception exhibited greater cortical activity to natural speech than to unintelligible speech. In contrast, implanted participants with poor speech perception produced pronounced cortical activation across stimulus classes. Moreover, the ratio of cortical activation in response to normal speech relative to that of scrambled speech directly correlated with their comprehension scores, though not with auditory threshold, age, side of implantation, or time after implantation. Because implanted adults with low speech perception scores produced indistinguishable cortical activation across stimulus classes without preferential response to speech, we interpret this as demonstration of compensatory processing effort.",>Luca Pollonini>Heather Bortfeld>Michael Beauchamp>John Oghalai,">University of Houston>University of California, Merced>Baylor College of Medicine>Stanford University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0838/index.html

Instead of just telling people that fruits and vegetables are healthy, providing a compelling causal and teleological explanatory framework could increase both people’s conviction about their health benefits and commitment to increasing the amount and variety of fruits and vegetables they consume. Our brief intervention: (1) emphasizes that fruits and vegetables have thousands of health-promoting phytochemicals, well beyond just vitamins, (2) describes clear causal mechanisms by which these foods ensure cellular health, (3) draws an analogy between the benefits of plant-based foods and the power of plant-derived medicines, and (4) explains that plants contain abundant nutrients because they must manufacture these chemicals for their own survival. This novel intervention improved understanding and increased participants’ intentions to eat more fruits and vegetables, illustrating how intuitive theories can shape motivation for behavioral change.",>Derek Powell>Ellen Markman,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0839/index.html

In addition to bridge the discovery of complex strategies with higher SR ability, the finding also suggests the necessity to integrate rule discovery exercises in curriculum to 1- practice while 2- recognize valid reasoning procedures. Finally, inquiring about the middle schooler’s capacity to recognize the most effective strategy, will help to assess the class level as a whole.

2017,Neural responses decrease while performance increases with practice: A neural network model,"Why do neural responses decrease with practice? We used a predictive neural network model of sentence processing (St. John & McClelland, 1990) to simulate neural responses during language understanding, and examined the model’s correlate of neural responses (specifically, the N400 component), measured as stimulus-induced change in hidden layer activation, across training. N400 magnitude first increased and then gradually decreased over training while comprehension performance at the output steadily rose with practice. These results fit the developmental trajectory of N400 amplitudes. Importantly, they also address the reduction of neural activation with practice. In the model, the reduction is due to continuous adaptation of connection weights over training. As connection weights between hidden and output layer grow stronger, less hidden layer activation is necessary to efficiently modulate the output. This shift of labor from activation to connection weights might be an important mechanism contributing to the reduction of neural activation with practice.",>Milena Rabovsky>Steven S. Hansen>James L.

2017,Age-related top-down and bottom-up guidance on eye movements when searching in real-world scenes,"Efficient selection of targets is crucial in everyday activities across the lifespan. Studies reporting age-related decline have, however, typically utilised arrays of simple, unrealistic objects. Using real-world scenes, we investigated how reliability of scene semantics (consistent vs. inconsistent targets), target template specificity (name vs. precise picture) and target perceptual salience influence oculomotor search behaviour in older vs. young viewers. Aging resulted in slower search considering initial saccade latency, time and number of fixations to locate the target, and verification of object-template matching. No group differences emerged in accuracy and in search facilitation due to a pictorial template or a semantically consistent target. Target high salience enhanced efficiency in both groups, with stronger effects in older viewers. Aging seems therefore to lead to an overall search speed reduction not due to specific deficits in utilisation of scene semantic guidance or in target recognition, and possibly reduced by enhancing target perceptual guidance.",>Hanane Ramzaoui>Sylvane Faure>Sara Spotorno,">Laboratoire d’Anthropologie et de Psychologie Cliniques, Cognitives et Sociales, Université Côte d’Azur, France>Laboratoire d’Anthropologie et de Psychologie Cliniques, Cognitives et Sociales, Université Côte d’Azur, France>Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0842/index.html
2017,The Long and Short of It: The Role of Verb Stem Vowel Duration in Sentence Processing,"When native English speakers say active and passive sentences, verb stems are longer in passive sentences than in their active counterparts (Stromswold et al., 2002; Rehrig et al., 2015) because phrase-final lengthening and polysyllabic shortening cause the verb stem vowel to be longer in passives (Aveni et al., 2016; Mayro et al., 2016). Eye-tracking and gating studies of unaltered sentences revealed that listeners are able to predict whether a sentence is active or passive prior to hearing the inflection on the verb (Stromswold et al., 2002; 2016). To examine whether listeners use vowel duration in online sentence comprehension, we lengthened the vowel in half of the active verb stems and shortened it in half of the passive verb stems. Reaction times were longer for sentences with altered verb stem vowels (p < .001), consistent with listeners using verb stem vowel duration as a predictive cue in online comprehension.",>Gwendolyn Rehrig>Sten Knutsen>Nicolaus Schrum>Paul de Lacy>Karin Stromswold,>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Rutgers University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0843/index.html

Likewise, it is expected that more trash items can be found in isolated compared to paired recycling bins. We conducted a field study that involved systematic comparisons of matched locations and focused on behavioral data that were obtained through systematic audits of trash and recycling bins.

Neurocomputational self-organization exhibits unique characteristics, including non-deterministic epigenetic (post-genetic) behavior, which enable direct functional and structural comparisons with the neocortex more than most existing relevant computational mechanisms.

We propose that one possible cause of under-exploration is present bias, whereby immediate rewards (like those gained from exploitation) loom larger than future rewards (like those gained from exploration). This possible cause of under-exploration is not addressed by past studies, in which choices generally yield token rewards that are converted to money at the end of the experiment, removing the inter-temporal aspect of the decision-making process. To address this issue, we developed an exploratory choice task with immediately-consumed rewards. We then tested whether whether imposing a temporal delay before the consumption of rewards increased exploration by decreasing present bias, and report on our results.",>Alexander S Rich>Todd M Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0846/index.html
2017,Everyday object affordance enhances automatic inhibitory control: an ERP study,"High affordance stimuli are associated with an enhancement in the activation of the corresponding motor programs. Such over-activation of motor programs may imply a decrease in performances based on inhibitory control. However, recent data suggest that high affordance stimuli are associated with a widespread privileged neural activation that goes beyond motor representations. In this case, we can expect that high affordance objects will be associated to a higher level of flexibility in an oddball task with Go-NoGo procedure. By measuring ERPs, we observed that, in the case of high affordance objects, the amplitude of the N200 is decreased when the inhibition of the motor response is more difficult. Data suggests that high affordance objects facilitate inhibitory control, probably due to a higher activation of automatic attentional resources.",>Stefania Righi>Giorgio Gronchi>Lapo Pierguidi>Maria Pia Viggiano,>University of Florence>University of Florence>University of Florence>University of Florence,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0847/index.html

In the present investigation, we expand research on the metacognitive monitoring of performance to this domain. Specifically, we examine participant’s ability to accurately monitor their performance in tasks that require them to rely on only their internal processes (e.g., short term memory to remember a series of letters) and tasks that require them to rely on both (e.g., paper and pencil to remember a series of letters).

However until recently, neuroimaging research largely focused solely on how people acquire categories defined by features. In the current electroencephalography (EEG) study, we examine how relational and feature-based category learning compare in well-matched learning tasks. Building on a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study by our laboratory, we capitalise on the rich temporal information offered by EEG. Focusing on the neural dynamics of how people learn category memberships over individual trials in an experimental task, we investigate how these single trial dynamics modulate computational estimates from decision-making modelling frameworks. Specifically, by sorting participants’ individual trials by their position in the experimental sequence we observe striking relationships between EEG dynamics (e.g., frontal theta oscillations and P300 component) and feature-based and relational categorisation behaviour.",>Gareth Roberts>Micah Goldwater>Evan Livesey>Josue Giron>Tyler Davis,">School of Psychology, University of Sydney>School of Psychology, University of Sydney>School of Psychology, University of Sydney>School of Psychology, University of Sydney>Department of Psychological Sciences, Texas Tech University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0849/index.html

In the present work, we developed a computational model of question generation. Based on a corpus of questions collected from online participants playing an information-seeking game, we designed a “grammar of questions.” The grammar is powerful enough to represent all human questions we collected and thus defines the “question space.” Given a particular context (game scenario), people are more likely to ask (generate) some questions that others. Our computational model predicts these likelihoods, that is, a probability distribution over the question space. In addition, the model can generalize to novel contexts.

2017,Shifting backward to say what’s front? Spatial referencing of dorsal object arrangements,"When referring to spatial arrangements of two objects in the visual field, German native speakers prefer reflection as a subtype of the relative frame of reference. Whether this preference transfers to objects in one’s back and whether a mental turn has to precede such dorsal references (turn hypothesis), has recently been explored in studies implementing questionnaires. However, the results hardly supported the turn hypothesis and rather suggested backward projection as an alternative strategy for dorsal references. To test the two assumptions more rigorously, a series of experiments implemented dorsal object arrangements in interview situations and induced dorsal perspectives via turning, shifting or reflecting the actual view of participants. Across experiments and conditions, backward projection consistently emerged as the preferred referencing strategy and only a small proportion of dorsal references accorded with the turn hypothesis. Participants’ retrospective descriptions supported this pattern and suggested backward projection to be involved in dorsal referencing.",>Annelie Rothe-Wulf>Andrea Bender>Julia Fischer>Nadine Lobmüller>Sieghard Beller,">University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany>University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway>University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany>University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany>University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0851/index.html
2017,The time course of Intentional Binding,"Environmental stimuli caused by actions (i.e., effects) are perceived earlier than stimuli not caused by actions. This phenomenon is termed intentional binding (IB), and serves as implicit measure of sense of agency. We investigated the influence of effect delay and temporal predictability on IB, measured with the classic clock procedure as the bias to perceive the effect as temporally shifted towards the action. For short delays, IB increased with delay (Experiment 1: 200 ms, 250 ms, 300 ms) and this initial increase declined for longer delays (Experiment 2: 100 ms, 250 ms, 400 ms). These results extend previous findings showing IB to decrease with increasing delays for delay ranges of 250 ms to 650 ms. Further, the indication that IB, that is, sense of agency, might be maximal for different delays depending on the specific characteristics and context of action and effect, has important implications for human-machine interfaces.",>Miriam Ruess>Roland Thomaschke>Andrea Kiesel,">Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, Freiburg i.

During one week, participants of the positive (neutral) group, had to choose the three most accurate positive (neutral) sentences (among 22) to describe their day. After this week, they had to estimate the probability of being 60, 70, 80, or 90 years old (traditional measure) and to situate themselves on a line representing their lifetime (spatial based measure).

In repeated binary choice tasks, human behave according to the theoretical basis of ""probability matching"" (Shanks et al., 2002), which has been advocated in several studies. However, the quality of reward may influence their choice-behavior. It is acknowledged that the sensitivity of values for gains or losses differs among individuals because of risk aversion (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). We conducted a series of experiments to investigate how participants' choices change when the ratio of hit-items was set up. Virtual rewards, -3/0, -3/+3, and 0/+3 point for each choice, were given to participants. The results showed that the choice-ratio of the weighted correct side was higher in conditions involving losses, suggesting that participants’ choices indicate risk aversion even though rewards were virtual.

For example, Japanese has no equivalent of the distinction between American English /r/ and /l/ and native speakers of Japanese have a hard time discriminating between these two sounds. Here, we ask whether standard Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems trained on large corpora of continuous speech can make correct quantitative predictions regarding such non-native phonetic category perception effects. By training an ASR system on language L1 and evaluating it on language L2, we obtain predictions for a native L1 speaker tested on L2 phonetic contrasts. Using a variety of L1 and L2, we show that ASR models correctly predict several well-documented effects. Beyond the immediate results, our evaluation methodology, based on a machine version of ABX discrimination tasks, opens the possibility of a more systematic investigation of computational models of phonetic category perception.",>Thomas Schatz>Francis Bach>Emmanuel Dupoux,">LSCP (ENS/EHESS/CNRS), Département d'Etudes Cognitives, Ecole Normale Supérieure, PSL Research University, France>SIERRA Project-Team (ENS/INRIA/CNRS), Département d'Informatique, Ecole Normale Supérieure, PSL Research University, France>LSCP (ENS/EHESS/CNRS), Département d'Etudes Cognitives, Ecole Normale Supérieure, PSL Research University, France",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0855/index.html

Medical tests differ not only in the type of information they provide, but in their financial costs and physical risks to a patient. We develop a model that combines informational and cost constraints, describing specific medical scenarios of a patient with realistic symptoms. We then define a finite number of existing medical tests that are available in this situation. The tests differ in their sensitivity and specificity concerning different possible underlying diseases as well as in their financial costs and the physical risks they pose to a patient. Combining these, we compare the utilities of the different tests if performed alone as well as if performed in combination. We show how purely informational considerations are not adequate for the analysis of such a scenario; test costs and patient outcomes must also be taken into account.",>Clara Schirren>Stefanie C.

2017,Intuitive system control: Challenging the standard model of dynamic decision making,"Dynamic decision making (DDM) is usually operationalized in a way that subjects explore and control computer-simulated dynamic systems consisting of interconnected variables. Most authors in the field agree on a “standard model of DDM” that assumes that decision makers have to learn the causal structure of the system through appropriate explorative behavior before they can bring the system to given goal states. This strategy draws heavily on cognitive ressources, such as working memory. The standard model predicts that performance in DDM, as well as structural knowledge should be severely impaired when a second cognitive task has to be executed while exploring the system. An experiment with a dual task as the main factor revealed no differences in knowledge and performance between the conditions. Participants in both conditions appeared to rely on rudimentary structural knowledge and adopted intuitive strategies.

2017,Learning Temporal Generative Neural Codes for Biological Motion Perception and Inference,"We introduce a modular recurrent neural architecture, which learns distributed, generative temporal models of biological motion. It encodes modal visual and proprioceptive (angular) biological motions separately by means of autoencoders, structuring respective postures, motion directions, and motion magnitudes separately. The submodal encoders are interdependent by predicting each other’s next autoencoder states temporally. As a result, distributed attractor states can develop from self-generated motions. We show that the architecture is able to synchronize its activities across modalities towards overall consistent action-encoding attractors. Moreover, the developing spatial and temporal structures can complete partially observable actions, e.g., when only providing visual information. Furthermore, we show that the network is capable of simulating whole-body actions without any sensory stimulation, thus imagining unfolding actions. Finally, we show that the network is able to infer the visual perspective on a biological motion. Thus, the neural architecture enables embodied perspective taking and action inference.",>Fabian Schrodt>Martin V.

2017,The Sufficiency Principle: Predicting when children will regularize inconsistent language variation,"Children exposed to inconsistent language variation regularize this variation in their productions (Hudson-Kam & Newport, 2005). Existing demonstrations of regularization observe this behavior when the signal-to-noise ratio is greater-than-or-equal-to 40%, but whether regularization occurs when the dominant form is less widespread has not been investigated. A recent computational model, the Sufficiency Principle, quantifies when a pattern is widespread enough to generalize (Yang, 2016): Let R be a generalization over N items, of which M are attested to follow R. R extends to all N items iff: N-M<N/ln(N). To test this model, we exposed children to artificial languages in which the dominant form occurred either above or below this threshold for generalization. We found that, as predicted, children regularized only under circumstance in which the Sufficiency Principle threshold for generalization is met. Thus, regularization may be governed by a basic principle of generalization that is well captured by this model.",>Kathryn D. Schuler>Jaclyn E. Horowitz>Charles Yang>Elissa L.

But it has also been found that tonal-language experience compensates the deficit in certain scenario, reducing prevalence rate of amusia in speakers of a highly complex tonal-language – Cantonese. Thus it remains unclear whether lexical tone perception, especially its phonological processing, is impaired in Cantonese-speaking amusics. This study investigated the categorical perception of a continuum of lexical tone stimuli and pure tone analogues in Cantonese-speaking amusics and controls. The amusics showed reduced discrimination peak across the categorical boundary compared to controls in lexical tone condition, suggesting impaired categorical perception; in pure tone condition, the amusics showed inferior performance on both between- and within-category discriminations, suggesting a deficit in auditory pitch processing. These findings indicate that phonological processing of tone is impaired in Cantonese-speaking amusics, despite possible compensation effect.",>Jing Shao>Xunan Huang>Caicai Zhang,>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0860/index.html
2017,Discovering kinds of future-oriented thought using automated machine-learning techniques,"Humans have a remarkable ability to think about the future. Our abilities to think about the future are essential for the level of goal construction, planning, and execution of plans that is only observable in humans. Thinking about the future has also been found to be important for the development of sense of self and for health and well-being. In spite of the importance of future-oriented thought, very little empirical work has been conducted on the nature of future-oriented thought. In this research, we demonstrate how automated methodologies can be used to identify references to the future from natural text (Study 1) and how machine-learning techniques can be used to identify categories of future-oriented thought (Study 2). We also demonstrate how the categories that emerge from these analyses can help us better understand the relation between future-oriented thought and many of the positive outcomes associated with future-oriented thought (Study 3).",>Jason Shepard>Aiming Nie>Bridget Copley>Phillip Wolff,>Agnes Scott College>Stanford University>CNRS/Universite Paris 8>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0861/index.html
2017,The influence of word-order harmony on structural priming in artificial languages,"Structural priming occurs when interlocutors copy the syntactic structure of their partners’ utterances, and is diagnostic of their underlying representations. We trained adult participants on an artificial ‘alien’ language in which nouns appeared with adjectives or numerals in two-word phrases; participants then used that language to communicate with an alien interlocutor. Input languages had variable word-order with the two modifier types tending to appear on the same side of the noun (harmonic) or on different sides of the noun (non-harmonic). Participants in all conditions acquired the dominant order of their input; however, structural priming only occurred within modifier types (e.g. encountering Numeral-Noun primed Numeral-Noun order only, not Adjective-Noun), even for participants exposed to harmonic input where both modifier types patterned the same way. This suggests that the abstract representations tapped by structural priming in rapidly-learnt artificial languages encode distinctions that are not based purely on distributional properties of the input.",>Kenny Smith>Olga Feher>Jennifer Culbertson,>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0862/index.html
2017,Recently rewarded task-irrelevant stimuli do not distract 2-year-olds during visual search,"In adults, stimuli associated with reward capture attention, even when task-irrelevant, resulting in distraction (Awh et al., 2012). Here we examine whether rewarded stimuli capture attention in 2-year-old children. Toddlers (N = 46, mean age: 28;10, range: 19;16 - 36;18) performed a visual search task where the target switched between blocks. Search arrays consisted of the current target, a previous target, and six feature conjunction distractors. On each trial, the current target was cued, and following a fixed search period, rotated as a reward. We used a Tobii T120 eye-tracker to record toddlers’ eye-movements. Following a target switch, toddlers fixated the current target before the previous target, despite the previous target’s recent reward history F(1, 44) = 31.183, p < 0.001).

2017,Disambiguating Disfluencies: What Do Speech Disfluencies Tell Us About Speech Production?,"Speech disfluencies occur frequently in spontaneous speech but their source is unclear. Disfluencies can take several forms, most commonly as verbalized disfluencies such as “um”, “uh”, and “so”, as well as silent pauses. In the present exploratory study we examined the relationship between disfluencies as distinct entities, individual differences in working memory capacity, and linguistic markers of complexity. We found that disfluencies diverge in their relationship with these variables. The “um” disfluency was most closely related to working memory capacity and linguistic complexity. The “uh” disfluency was associated with infrequent word production. The “so” disfluency predicted of the number of words produced. Silent disfluencies were not related to working memory capacity. However, micro-pauses were related to word production, and macro-pauses were negatively correlated with the “so” disfluency. Results are discussed in terms of potential relationships between disfluencies and speech production processes.",>Mikhail Sokolov>John Logan,>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0864/index.html
2017,Phonological Competition during Spoken-Word Recognition in Infants and Adults,"An ongoing debate concerns whether spoken word recognition happens in an incremental or continuous manner (Marslen-Wilson & Zwitserlood, 1989; McClelland & Elman, 1986). In the current study, participants (31 adults and 49 infants aged 24-30months) were presented with four images while they heard a sentence like “Look at the cat”. Among the images was one object that rhymed with the spoken word, one object that shared its onset and two phonologically unrelated objects. Growth curve analysis of eye-tracking data revealed that adults preferentially fixated onset competitors over unrelated objects soon after word onset but did not preferentially fixate rhyme competitors. Fixations of the onset competitors were modulated by the degree to which the onsets of the three remaining competitors were phonologically similar to the spoken word. Infants showed no preference for either type of phonologically related competitor. The absence of a rhyme effect contradicts continuous theories of spoken word recognition.",>Marlene Spangenberg>Kim Plunkett,">University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom>University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0865/index.html
2017,Word order rules in business name binomials,"Naming practices offer a window onto linguistic processes of productivity that rely on input from interacting streams of information. Previous studies have looked at proper personal names and binomial combinations of proper personal names to show that phonological features such as rhythm, semantic features such as gender, and corpus features such as word frequency play an important role in naming and ordering of names. In comparison to personal names, business names tend to be more diverse in terms of constituent structure, often incorporating binomial constructions that may or may not consist of proper names themselves. In this study, we investigate whether the ordering of binomials in business names reflects the features identified in previous work, with a focus on the following: syllable count, metrical stress, animacy, concreteness, word frequency, and binomial frequency.

2017,The time course of colour guidance in realistic scene search,"Colour is a source of attentional guidance and object segmentation when viewing a scene. In an eye-tracking study, we examined its role during search of targets placed in consistent or inconsistent locations within realistic scene contexts. Both the target template and the whole scene were presented in full colour or grayscale. Colour presence did not influence early search, considering latency, direction or gain of the first saccade, but affected later phases, with longer scene scanning and more fixations required to locate the target in the grayscale condition, which also lengthened verification of template-object matching. These effects were enhanced in inconsistent scenes. Our results suggest that observers may not utilise colour cues when initiating scene inspection during search but also that colour information modulates efficiency of the search process in terms of attentional selection and object recognition, in particular when the context of the scene does not provide reliable high-level guidance.",>Sara Spotorno>Ben Tatler,">University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom>University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0867/index.html
2017,Perceptual decision making from correlated samples,"The optimal perceptual decision making strategy for weighting serially presented information depends on the degree of sample dependence. Uniform weighting produces optimal estimates from independent samples, but increases in autocorrelation should be matched by increasing and symmetric overweighting of early and late samples in order to maintain optimal performance. In the current experiment, participants (N = 30) observed briefly presented sequences of eight dots and were asked to estimate their center of mass by dragging the cursor. The autocorrelation of the series was manipulated in two distinct blocks (either 0 or .7). Preliminary results show that the weight assignment to uncorrelated inputs did not differ significantly from the optimal uniform allocation. In contrast, in the high-dependence block participants used different weighting profiles - overweighting the first and/or last samples of the sequence. This suggests that humans flexibly adapt to changes in statistical structure in the predicted direction of optimality.",>Oana Stanciu>Mate Lengyel>Daniel Wolpert>Jozsef Fiser,">Central European University, Budapest, Hungary>University of Cambridge>University of Cambridge>Central European University, Budapest, Hungary",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0868/index.html
2017,Optimality of visual search under ambiguous stimuli,"A hallmark of optimal decision making is that cues are weighted by their reliability. Previous studies have reported evidence for reliability weighting in several human perceptual decision-making tasks in which sensory noise was the only possible source of errors. Here we use a target detection task to test whether optimality generalizes to situations where stimulus ambiguity is an additional source of uncertainty. Target and distractor orientations were drawn from distributions with different means and the level of ambiguity was varied through the amount of overlap between the two distributions. In line with previous studies, we found clear evidence for sensory reliability-weighting, regardless of the level of ambiguity. However, using a richer set of models than before, we also found that the estimated weights deviated from the optimal ones. Finally, we found no effect of ambiguity level on task efficiency, which suggests that subjects optimally accounted for this source of uncertainty.",>Elina Stengård>Ronald van den Berg,">Department of Psychology, Uppsala, Sweden>Department of psychology, Uppsala, Sweden",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0869/index.html
2017,"It is new, but will it be good? Context-driven exploration of novel options","How do people decide whether to try out novel options? We argue that they utilize contextual information to efficiently generalize from learned functional relations in order to decide between known or novel options. In a contextual multi-armed bandit task, in which rewards are a noisy function of observable features, we assess participants' preferences for newly introduced options. We show that participants preferably choose a novel option if its features indicate high rewards, but shun the option if its features indicate low rewards, a behavior that can only be explained by functional generalization. Moreover, we assess people's preferences for novel options that have medium rewards to test whether they prefer options less similar to experienced options, consistent with choices guided by uncertainty. Given that novel options normally come with observable features, we argue that contextual learning is a parsimonious yet powerful explanation of behavior in the face of novelty.",>Hrvoje Stojic>Eric Schulz>Maarten Speekenbrink,">University College London, London, London, United Kingdom>University College London, London, London, United Kingdom>University College London, London, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0870/index.html

2017,"Speaking in English, sorting in Chinese: interaction in L2 can reinforce existing categories in L1","How does interaction affect categorization, and how might this vary between native and non-native speakers? When people use shared labels to categorize objects, they categorize more similarly to each other. We investigated whether interaction leads non-native speakers to categorize in the same way as native speakers. In six rounds, L1-English and L2-English/L1-Mandarin speakers individually categorized dishware using labels (BOWL, PLATE), then discussed their categories or an unrelated topic after each round. L2 speakers’ categories shifted following category-relevant interaction with L1 speakers, but their categories did not become more L1-like. Unexpectedly, category-relevant interaction reduced alignment within pairs and within language groups; however, this effect was weaker in the L2 than L1 group. Hence, L2 speakers showed a stronger tendency than L1 speakers to use categories that were similar to other speakers from their language group. This suggests that interaction in an L2 can reinforce L2 speakers' categories in their L1.",>Ellise Suffill>Holly Branigan>Martin Pickering,">University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, United Kingdom>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0872/index.html
2017,The effect of overt language use on category induction,"Successfully solving a problem should help people solve similar problems, but such generalization is often surprisingly limited. We investigated generalization performance when people explicitly verbalized solutions to open-ended category-induction ""Bongard problems"", compared to tacitly indicating that they had found a solution. In a Bongard problem people are presented with an array of items falling into two classes, and have to induce the basis for the classification by working out what (sometimes quite abstract) feature of the items is relevant, from a vast set of possibilities. We measured objective performance by testing people with new items, and observed how explicitly vs. tacitly expressed solutions affected generalization across concretely similar or abstractly similar problems. For the concretely similar problems, explicitness boosted transfer of correct solutions. For the abstractly similar problems, there was no evidence of transfer, though there was a general positive effect of explictness.",>Justin Sulik>Haily Merritt>Gary Lupyan,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA>University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0873/index.html

The results showed that the drawn object’s position in not only a concrete but also an abstract action sentence is changed before and after the action.

2017,A time-series eye-fixation analysis of the similarity-compromise effect in multi-alternative choice,"In decision-making tasks with two attributes and three alternatives, the similarity effect implies that, if the total expected utility is equal between two opposite alternatives (i.e., the target and competitor), the probability of the target being chosen decreases with the addition of the decoy similar to the target. This study demonstrated the similarity-compromise effect, wherein the probability of the target being chosen increased with the addition of the decoy, under the same conditions as the similarity effect, by setting all attribute values of three alternatives to broken numbers rather than rounded numbers. To determine the mechanism underlying this effect, we examined information acquisition patterns using eye-movement data collected from 37 undergraduates who made 10 hypothetical purchase tasks with two attributes and three alternatives. Time-series analysis of fixation time for the three alternatives revealed dynamic temporal features distinct from those of attraction and compromise effects observed in our previous research.",>Tsuzuki Takashi>Chiba Itsuki,>Rikkyo University>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0875/index.html

Through analyzing head-camera video frame by frame, we measured the rate of change of scene information in the natural world of children in this context, and found that the visual world from the child’s perspective changes continuously.

We investigated the effects of different prediction relations between delay duration and response requirements on user performance. In one experiment, delay duration predicted, to different degrees (50 % vs. 75 % vs. 100 %), the following system response. Predictability substantially increased users’ response speed, while adaptation was highly flexible, between different prediction regimes. In a second experiment, users’ responses predicted system delay duration. Compared to the first experiment, users’ response speed was moderately increased, while the adaptation was rather inflexible across different prediction regimes. In a third experiment, we directly compared both types of predictability. The results confirmed a stronger and more flexible adaptation effect when time predicted the system response, compared to when users’ responses predicted time.

A central challenge in the cultural evolution literature is to understand how the unique computational principles of human cognition scaffold the emergence of complex behavioural systems. I explore how the human ability to make inferences at higher order levels of abstraction can lead to cultural complexity, in two ways: by allowing initially independent behaviours to gradually acquire group-like structure as new learners repeatedly impose an expectation for statistical dependence; and by allowing inferences in one domain to be rapidly transferred to new domains which share features at higher-order levels of abstraction.

In this research, we examined the evolvability of recursive combination in combinatorial space parametrized by kinds of elemental materials and the number of elements per product. Recursive combination evolved in the region of low kinds of elemental materials and large number of elements per product. This region may be compared with the situation of the middle stone age when invented diversified tools with limited kinds of materials such as stone, bone, and woods.

Using a Visual World paradigm, we then measured relations knowledge as the degree to which children looked at related versus unrelated distractors when asked to look for targets.

2017,Predicting Future Performance in an ITS system via Gradient Boosting Classification,"Gradient Boosting Classification (GBC) models are well known to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Having the ability to predict user performance is imperative to the outcomes and purpose of an intelligent tutoring system. The Center for the Study of Adult Literacy (CSAL) intelligent tutoring system aims to improve reading comprehension in low-literacy adult learners. A GBC was applied to preliminary data gathered from high-literacy adult readers (N =1800 observations). Our model was shown high accuracy in predicting users’ correct/incorrect responses to our multiple choice items. Specifically, users’ reaction times and order of question presentation are important features of the model to consider. Less important features are difficulty of the item and the users reading ability. Our next steps are to apply GBC to high-literacy college students, followed by low-literacy readers, as a test set. Our eventual goal is to predict correctness prior to scoring.",>Breya Walker>Anne lippert>Raven Davis>Zhiqiang Cai>Cheng Qinyu>Genghu Shi>Arthur Graesser,">University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, United States>University of Memphis, Memphis, TN>University of Memphis, Memphis, TN>The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN>The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN>The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN>The University of Memphis",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0890/index.html
2017,"Interactivity, Stereotype threat, and Working memory","The purpose of the current study was to investigate the role of interactivity (the use of pen and paper) in defusing the impact of stereotype threat on difficult mental arithmetic tasks, covering all four operations of mathematics. Eighty-four 16-year-old girls from secondary schools in South East England (UK) participated in this study. Participants carried out (in an educational setting) difficult, multi-digit mental arithmetic tasks in a stereotype threat or control condition, crossed with interactivity or no interactivity. The primary dependent variables were the overall performance of the participants in accuracy, latency to solution, working memory, and mathematics anxiety. Increased interactivity enhanced mental arithmetic performance. Girls in the stereotype condition performed worse in the working memory test than the participants in the control condition. However, there was no causal role of working memory in reduced mathematics performance under stereotype threat. Reasons for this finding and recommendations for future studies are discussed.",>Anna-Stiina Wallinheimo>Harriet Tenenbaum>Adrian Banks,">University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom>University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom>University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0891/index.html
2017,Judging Magnitude: Is there a Common Cognitive System for Different Types of Magnitude Judgments?,"It has been suggested that a common cognitive system is employed in magnitude judgments across multiple modalities (Walsh, 2003). To test this theory, we examined whether performance on magnitude judgments of number, surface area, duration, and loudness correlated with each other in both magnitude comparison (e.g., determine which is more), and magnitude estimation (e.g., if magnitude 1 value = 100, estimate the value of magnitude 2) tasks. For magnitude comparison, significant correlations were observed between number, surface area, and loudness (but not duration) tasks (percent correct measured). Similar results were observed for magnitude estimation (mean absolute percent deviation of value estimates from correct measured). These results are indicative of a common cognitive system for at least some magnitude judgment modalities, and suggest that such a system may play a role not only in more-than/less-than magnitude judgments, but also in the process of assigning numerical values to magnitudes.",>Rylan J.

2017,Effects of Auditory-Feedback Delays and Musical Roles on Coordinated Timing Asymmetries in Piano Duet Performance,"Recent research in human behavioral dynamics has demonstrated that co-actors often successfully achieve joint goals by adopting functionally asymmetric patterns of behavior. To better understand the evolution of such patterns in a naturalistic musical context, the current study examined how auditory-feedback delays and individual musical roles affect collective temporal stability and relative adaptability during duet performance. The delays between pianists were short (10-40 ms), bidirectional, and remained constant during a single trial, simulating those typical in internet-mediated performance. Preliminary results show increasingly reduced collective stability for longer delays along with a distinct pattern of asynchronies across the points where temporal synchrony would be expected, in which individuals exhibited consistent alternation between playing before or after their co-performer. Furthermore, asynchronies became greater when the two musical parts were less similar. Thus, emerging coordinative dynamics appear to be shaped both by asymmetries in co-performers’ assigned roles and external constraints on shared information.",>Auriel Washburn>Matthew Wright>Takako Fujioka,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0893/index.html
2017,What influences the impact of warning labels in decisions from description-plus-experience,"Warning labels can be considered as descriptions added to repeated decisions-from-experience. Limited research so far has looked at the theoretical integration of decisions from descriptions and decisions from experience when the two are available concurrently. We explore how the presence and timing of such warning labels influence behaviour. We expected the provision of warning labels to subsequently reduce risk taking, and that more prior experience before the appearance of such labels would lead to stronger habit formation and reduce their behavioural impact. Instead, we show how the appearance of descriptions warning against risks can have a perverse effect of increasing risk taking. And counter-intuitively, we also observe that the amount of previous experience prior to the appearance of descriptions does not impact behaviour. Briefly presented warning labels also have the same effect as constantly present ones. All of these findings have strong implications on the design of effective warning labels.",>Leonardo Weiss-Cohen>Emmanouil Konstantinidis>Maarten Speekenbrink>Nigel Harvey,">University College London, London, London, United Kingdom>University of New South Wales>University College London>University College London, London, London, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0894/index.html
2017,Later lexical development in bilinguals,"We investigated object naming in Dutch-French bilingual children to determine the developmental trajectory of the cross-language convergence in naming patterns shown by bilingual adults. We collected name choices for nearly 200 common household containers from French-Dutch simultaneous bilinguals of 6 different age groups, along with monolingual control groups. Multidimensional scaling analysis on a group level suggests that convergence is present in bilinguals at all ages. On the individual level, pairwise between-subject correlations show that monolingual naming patterns in different languages show a remarkable correspondence at younger ages. Between age 5 and adulthood, the naming patterns of monolingual children demonstrate increasing divergence as they learn the language specificities of their L1. Bilingual children, however, maintain a fully converged naming pattern up till age 10. They start learning some language-specific idiosyncrasies from age 12 onwards, but never to the extent of monolinguals. We propose a gradual divergence perspective for bilingual lexical development.",>Anne White>Barbara Malt>Steven Verheyen>Gert Storms,">KU Leuven - University of Leuven>Lehigh University>Institut Jean-Nicod, PSL Research University, École Normale Supérieure>KU Leuven - University of Leuven",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0895/index.html
2017,An immersive binaural horizon for sonic data analytics,"Accessible data analytics—that can be experienced through vision, hearing, and touch—poses a challenge to interaction design. It is also a human rights requirement because many societies mandate that all individuals have the right to experience products and services, yet not every individual accesses media visually. As more data is presented through visualization, accessibility for populations who do not access data through vision decreases. Guidelines that claim to make visual media accessible through text fail to translate the iconic properties of visual shapes, thus subtracting affordances for pattern recognition. Non-linguistic sonication can be a means for non-visual pattern recognition. Hearing is optimized for detecting locations on a horizontal plane, and our approach for presenting data analytics recruits this optimization by using an immersive binaural horizontal plane. We will demonstrate our approach via two case studies: A sonic translation of a map and a sonic translation of a computational fluid dynamics simulation.",>Richard Windeyer>Dan MacDonald>David Steinman>Ambrose Li>Peter Coppin,">The Centre for Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies, University of Toronto and the Perceptual Artifacts Lab, OCAD University>Biomedical Simulation Lab, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto>Biomedical Simulation Lab, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto>Perceptual Artifacts Lab, OCAD University>Perceptual Artifacts Lab, Faculty of Design, OCAD University and The Department of Mechancial and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0896/index.html
2017,A model of cultural co-evolution of language and mindreading,"Language requires mindreading for entertaining communicative intentions, and mindreading in turn profits from language as a means for sharing mental states. Hence it has been hypothesised that the two skills have co-evolved. We present a Bayesian agent-based model to formalise this hypothesis. This model combines referential signalling with mental states, such that a speaker’s topic choice is probabilistically dependent on their perspective on the world. In order to learn the language, a learner has to simultaneously infer the speaker’s lexicon and perspective. Learners can solve this task by bootstrapping one with the other, but only if the speaker uses an informative language. We will present results of an iterated learning version of this model, showing that selection on communication results in the emergence of a fully informative lexicon from scratch. However, selection on perspective-taking alone also results in the emergence of partially-informative lexicons, which is sufficient for inferring others’ perspectives.",>Marieke Woensdregt>Simon Kirby>Chris Cummins>Kenny Smith,">University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh>University of Edinburgh",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0897/index.html

It sets out to test whether managing the process of silent reading might modify text complexity as perceived. The paper is a combination of two studies. The first study was the development and assessment of a reading comprehension test. The second study piloted an intervention for pre-adolescents. Item-by-item analysis of students’ performance in the post-test show changes in the perception of item difficulty after the intervention. Chinese EFL struggling readers were found to be weaker in lexical analysis. They also faced difficulties in decoding main ideas in compound/complex sentences. In response to the analysis, strategies were developed for automatic syntactic processing. The paper proposes seeing language as a process, rather than a product so that learner management skills might be prepared for reading intervention.",>Hing Yi Wong>Susanna Yeung>Wen Chung Wang>Chi Wing Yip,">The Education University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , Canton, China>The Education University of Hong Kong>The Education University of Hong Kong>The Education University of Hong Kong ",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0898/index.html
2017,Influences of the Matching Effects of Cognitive and Emotional Factors on Attitude Change,This research is aimed to study whether we will have the same attitude change when we have the same intensity of cognitive or emotional level for attitude. People who have higher involvement will be persuaded by central route and low involvement will be persuaded by peripheral route: the matching effect in attitude change. The present study controlled the intensity of both cognitive and emotional factor and instructed participants to express their initial attitude as well as attitude change under four experimental manipulations. Results showed that only matching effect of emotional factor was found but not cognitive factor. A connectionist model was therefore built to simulate the processes and found that there would have different thresholds for cognitive and emotional routes and the threshold of cognitive route should be higher than emotional route.

2017,Is infants’ mutual exclusivity response based on preference to novelty or non-name of an object?,"Although “mutual exclusivity (ME)” is the term to refer to the behavior that infants map a novel label onto a novel object rather than a familiar object, two studies, using preferential looking paradigm, aimed to investigate whether infants’ ME is based on preference to novelty or non-name of an object. In Study 1, 18-month-olds were tested on 2 conditions: familiar-object/novel-object trials with known label and familiar-object/novel-object trials with unknown label. The infants preferred to novel objects before naming but no naming effect found for both conditions. In Study 2, 18-month-olds in the same two conditions as Study 1 were pre-familiarized to both of novel and familiar objects. The results showed that the naming effects were found for both conditions, indicating that ME occurred. The findings of the present studies suggest that pre-familiarization could be used to validate if 18-month-olds’ ME response is based on non-name preference of an object.",>Qinmei Xu>Ye Tao>Yuyan Wang>Jon-Fan Hu,">Center for Learning and Cognitive Science, College of Education, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China>Department of Special Education, Zhejiang Normal University, Hangzhou, China>Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China>National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0900/index.html
2017,Children's Attention to Semantic Content versus Emotional Tone: Differences between Two Cultural Groups,"People from varied cultural backgrounds differ in their attention to particular aspects of emotional cues. Whereas semantic content explicitly expresses feelings, vocal tone conveys implicit information regarding emotions. This study examined the attention to different emotional cues in European-American and Chinese children. Participants were 121 European-American and 120 Chinese children (4-9 years old). They played two games in which they listened to spoken words and judged the pleasantness of the word meaning while ignoring the vocal tone (meaning game) or judged the pleasantness of the vocal tone while ignoring the word meaning (tone game). Preliminary results showed that European-American children paid more attention to word meaning than did Chinese children. Additionally, older (8-9 years old) Chinese children attended more to vocal tone than did their European-American counterparts. The results suggest that children acquire culturally specific attention bias by 8-9 years old.",>Yang Yang>Li Wang>Qi Wang,">Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States>Peking University, Beijing, China>Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0901/index.html
2017,Knowledge partitioning in forecasting,"In this study, we would like to examine whether the learned forecasting function can be separated for use by context. The participants were asked to learn to forecast the position of a target, defined as a sine function of trial number. A context cue was paired with the moving of the target systematically and randomly in two conditions. The learning performance was quite good in both conditions. In the transfer phases, in the systematic-context condition, some participants learned to rely on context to direct their prediction (i.e., knowledge partitioning), whereas some others and those in the randomized-context condition learned to rely on the concept about the function for forecasting. However, contrary to the precedent knowledge partitioning studies, the variety of using context or not was found within participants across transfer phases.

In experiment one, forty native Cantonese listeners were recruited to participate in two tasks (1) a Chinese version reading span task (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) to measure their WM capacity and (2) a cross-modal priming task (Yip, 2015). In experiment two, another group of native Mandarin listeners were recruited to participate in the same two tasks in Mandarin. The results revealed that sentence context had an early effect on the disambiguation processes for both high- and low-WM span groups and the underlying mechanism of the disambiguation process for the high-WM span group seemed to be in an inhibitory nature.",>Michael Yip,>The Education University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0903/index.html
2017,"Impact of Polarity, Rationality, and Math Ability on Numerical Magnitude Knowledge","Previous research has shown that numerical magnitude knowledge is related to current mathematic abilities and predictive of future mathematics performance. Much of this early research examined magnitude knowledge of positive whole numbers, more recently this has been extended to positive rational numbers. However, research about negative number magnitude knowledge is less abundant. The present study aims to understand how different types of magnitude knowledge relate to one another and whether performance differs according to the type of number line scale. Thirteen number line scales were used to assess 7th grade students’ (N=180) magnitude knowledge of positive and negative, whole and rational numbers. Correlational analyses illustrate that performance on most scales are significantly related. Further analyses reveal that students’ performance differed depending on the scale’s polarity and the number type of the scale. Moreover, performance differences were found to vary according to students’ mathematics classroom ability level.

2017,Global consequences of local complexity: evidence from recall of visually presented nonwords,"There is extensive evidence that structural regularities affect the processing of visually-presented words. However, it is not known whether the processing consequences of an orthographic violation are limited to the offending subpart (e.g., an unattested onset cluster) or apply more globally (e.g., to the entire word). We provide evidence of global disruption from the recall of briefly-presented nonwords that were manipulated for degree of orthographic markedness and length. Error rates were higher for both the initial and final portions of nonwords beginning with more marked onsets; symmetrically, report of marked onsets was degraded in words with longer endings. These effects suggest that, as in other visual tasks, the fidelity with which one element can be represented depends on the overall stimulus complexity. We present a modified version of rational models of visual word perception in which global effects result from the distribution of a limited processing resource over letter positions.",>Mackenzie Young>Colin Wilson,>Johns Hopkins University>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0905/index.html

In the “footprints” task children were shown a geometric solid, such as a pyramid or a prism, and asked to select which shape the solid would make if it were dipped in ink and stamped on a piece of paper. Through a latent class analysis of children’s errors we found children differed significantly in their misconceptions about object structure. Three distinct classes of children emerged: children who could only match visible faces, children who believed solids have an ‘essential’ face irrespective of rotation, and children who differentiated faces based on a solid’s rotation. We examined the characteristics of children in each of these classes using a battery of spatial tasks and numeric tasks. Our results suggest errors found in older children’s and adults’ reasoning about geometric concepts develop prior to formal schooling.",>Christopher Young>Alana Foley>Susan Levine,">University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States>University of Chicago>University of Chicago",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0906/index.html
2017,"Relevance Theory, Pragmatic Inference and Cognitive Architecture","Relevance Theory (RT: Sperber&Wilson;, 1986) argues that human interpretative processes maximize relevance and postulates that there is a relevance-based procedure that a listener follows when trying to understand utterances. However, Mazzone (2013) points out that RT fails to explain how speaker-related information, such as the speaker’s abilities or preferences, is incorporated into pragmatic processes. He proposes that situational or goal schemata, with the speaker represented as a component, are sufficient to activate the hearer’s speaker-related knowledge and further asserts that human communication is driven by goal management and action rather than relevance maximization. Yet Mazzone cannot fully explain how linguistic meaning and speaker-related knowledge are integrated within a modular system. Based on RT’s cognitive requirements and contemporary cognitive theory, we argue that this integration is realized within working memory via production-like conversational rules with which the constructed utterance interpretation should be consistent, and present a simple model of this process.",>Wen Yuan>Richard Cooper,">Beihang University, Beijing, China>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0907/index.html

The experiment used a fictive retrieval system (searching onomatopoeia), and the virtual assistant character looked up for suitable words for the user (success), or failed to find the words (mistake). There were three sessions, differing by the task of character’s mistake; two tasks were successes and one was a failure in each session. The results showed that the group of people who had low expectation from its first appearance, formed negative impressions after the final mistake, significantly. Consequently, final mistake influenced the formation of negative impression more than other mistakes, thus showing that the final mistake in multiple times of assistance was associated with loss effect.",>Masahide Yuasa,>Shonan Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0908/index.html

The paper argues the novel approach to automated retrieval of information on temporal relations between events marked in the text. The data retrieved will provide additions to computer ontology which formally represents the actual events chronology. A system of linguistic algorithms for analyzing the contexts with specific verbal (or linguistic situations) inputs is suggested within the present approach.

2017,The Impact of Presentation Order on Category Learning Strategies: Behavioral Data and Self-Reports,"The presentation order in supervised categorization learning can influence the category representation. For example, the order can bias a rule-based approach focusing the identification of relevant features or an exemplar-based approach focusing the similarity of category members. In a blocked design stimuli can either be presented in a way that relevant features over stimuli become obvious or that two succeeding stimuli share as many common features as possible (cf. Mathy & Feldman, 2016). In an empirical study with 21 participants we investigated both orders for the 5-4 category structure (Medin & Schaffer, 1978) and assessed categorization behavior and self-reports in the first trials. Results suggest that the answer behavior and self-reports during the first trials can be influenced by the presentation order.

In mouse-tracking, an increasingly popular decision-making paradigm, difficult choices lead to increased curvature of the mouse trajectories towards the unchosen option. Here we explore whether traces of a decision process can be found in its motor output in a more naturalistic setting. Our subjects performed a series of choices between a smaller reward now and a larger reward at some delay. Using Kinect camera, we recorded subjects' walking trajectories when they moved towards their preferred option displayed in one of the corners across the room. We found that deviation of subjects' trajectories from the ideal trajectory increased with delay when they preferred the ""later"" option, and decreased with delay in trials where the ""now"" option was chosen.

In each trial, participants judged whether a test face had been among a small set of recently studied faces. We used a combination of hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) and multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decompose the neural signal into a sequence of latent stages. Analyzed separately, EEG and ECoG data yielded converging results on the durations of recovered stages. Combining these stages with the high spatial resolution of ECoG suggested that activity in the temporal cortex reflected item familiarity in the retrieval stage; and that once retrieval is complete, there is active maintenance of the studied face set in the medial temporal lobe (MTL).

However, it remains unclear the extent to which individuals believe that organization will help to improve task performance when they are asked to carry out mundane tasks in the real world. To examine this, individuals were asked to search through a pile of Lego building blocks for specific pieces. Prior to the search task, they were asked their preferred strategy for this task (e.g., organizing vs. not organizing the Lego pile prior to search) and to estimate how much time and effort each strategy would take for task completion.

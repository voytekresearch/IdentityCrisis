2011,Tutorial on Model Comparison Methods,The question of how one should decide among competing explanations of data is at the heart of the scientific enterprise. Computational models of cognition are increasingly being advanced as descriptions and explanations of behavior in the cognitive sciences. The success of this line of inquiry depends on the availability of robust quantitative methods to guide the evaluation and selection of these models. The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce methods of evaluating and selecting among mathematical models of cognition. Our goal in the tutorial is to provide a good conceptual overview of methods of model comparison with illustrative examples using selected models in cognitive science.,>Jay Myung>Mark Pitt,>Ohio State University>Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0001/index.html
2011,"PRE-CogSci 2011  Bridging the gap between computational, empirical and theoretical approaches to reference","The PRE-CogSci 2011 workshop is a follow up to the first workshop on the Production of Referring Expressions: Bridging the gap between computational and empirical approaches to reference (PRE-CogSci 2009), organised on 29 July 2009 as part of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2009) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Given the strong interest that the production of referring expressions has attracted on both occasions, another PRE-CogSci workshop seems timely, and will be organized as part of the 2011 Annual Meeting in Boston, MA. This workshop is similar to the first in its topic and overall structure, but this time we also emphasise the role of theoretical linguistic work, explore new directions (e.g., referring expressions in dialogue), and organise a panel discussion on the way in which different research communities can benefit from each others' expertise on the production of language.",>Kees van Deemter>Albert Gatt>Roger van Gompel>Emiel Krahmer,">University	of	Aberdeen>University of Malta

2011,ACT-R Tutorial,"ACT-R (Anderson, Bothell, Byrne, Douglass, Lebiere & Qin, 2004) is a cognitive theory and simulation system for developing cognitive models. It assumes cognition emerges through the interaction of a procedural memory of productions with a declarative memory of chunks and independent modules for external perception and actions. Since its release in 1993, ACT-R has supported the development of over 100 cognitive models, published in the literature by many different researchers. These models cover topics as diverse as driving behavior, implicit memory, learning backgammon, metaphor processing, and emotion. This tutorial will discuss the latest version of ACT-R, ACT-R 6.0, which is more interruptible, achieves greater across-task parameter consistency, has better mechanisms of production learning, and is more in correspondence with our knowledge of brain functioning than previous versions (Figure 1).",>Niels Taatgen>Jelmer Borst,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0003/index.html
2011,New Developments in the Cognitive Science of Religion. Hosted by the International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion (IACSR),"The International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion (IACSR) seeks to advance the naturalistic study of religion. The IACSR recognizes that the cognitive sciences encompass a wide array of disciplines and methods, including, among others, experimental research in psychology and neuroscience, computational modeling, ethnographic, historical, archaeological, and comparative studies of religious cognition, and the survey techniques of the social sciences. The main goal of the workshop is to introduce CSS members to topics that are cutting edge in the cognitive science of religion.

2011,"Tutorial on using the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) in the laboratory, the field, and the classroom","Laboratory and field research in cognitive science often uses computer-based tools to design experiments and collect data. Although researchers are typically happy to exchange the data obtained from such studies, sharing the actual software used to collect the data is more difficult. This partly stems from the widespread use of special-purpose proprietary software tools to collect data, which prevents exchange and review of the actual experiment specification (without purchasing costly licenses) and can at times even prevent researchers from accessing their own past experiments. Yet often, without a good understanding of the exact experiment, the data can be difficult to interpret. Furthermore, such systems are typically tied to a particular operating system platform, reducing the ability to exchange, modify, and evaluate details of an experiment.",>Shane Mueller,">Applied Research Associates, Inc.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0006/index.html

2011,"Workshop: The Psychology of Negotiation: When, Why and How","Economic conditions are placing unprecedented pressures on universities and funding agencies. For young scholars, this translates into fewer postdoctoral and faculty lines. For highly experienced senior scholars, it emerges as fewer opportunities for new programs of research and collaborations, and this in turn limits the options available to senior scientists for training young scientists. Research and economic analyses predict that the impact of the economic crisis to be more detrimental for females than for males (see, e.g., the 2009 ILO Report on Women and the Economic Crisis). Against this backdrop, reports that recent male PhDs are almost three times more likely than recent female PhDs to initiate financial negotiations assume immense significance (Babcock & Laschever, 2003).

2011,Perspective and Embodiment,"Embodied cognition is a rapidly expanding research program that emphasizes the formative role of interactions with the environment in how cognitive processes develop and function. A variety of theoretical accounts have been formulated in the different cognitive science sub-fields (cognitive development/psychology, cognitive robotics, psycholinguistics, social cognition, and philosophy of mind), enriching this interdisciplinary research arena and at the same time underlining the need for more dialogue across fields, theories, and methodologies. Recent research attempts to account for embodiment not only in terms of an individuals interactions with the environment but also with other minds and other bodies. This brings to the fore issues concerned with perspective taking, both in spatial and in more general conceptual terms. Indeed, much of the research in embodied cognition has a spatial dimension.",>Holly Taylor>Elena Andonova,>Tufts University>New Bulgarian University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0011/index.html
2011,How to use Mechanical Turk for Cognitive Science Research,"In this half-day tutorial we will describe a new tool that has emerged in the last 5 years for conducting online behavioral research: crowdsourcing platforms. The term crowdsourcing has its origin in an article by Howe (2006), who defined it as a job outsourced to an undefined group of people in the form of an open call. One of the main benefits of these platforms to behavioral researchers is that they provide access to a large set of people who are willing to do tasksincluding participating in research studiesfor relatively low pay. The crowdsourcing site with one of the largest subject pools is Amazons Mechanical Turk (AMT), so it is the focus of this tutorial.",>Winter Mason>Siddharth Suri,">Yahoo! Research

2011,Doing Cognitive Science by Hand: A Tutorial on Computer Mouse-Tracking,"Recently, the measurement of computer-mouse trajectories en route to choices on the screen has served as a window into the real-time dynamics of a wide range of cognitive processes. This mouse-tracking methodology is able to provide a sensitive, temporally fine-grained measure by which participants tentative commitments to various choice alternatives can be tracked semi-continuously over hundreds of milliseconds. Similar in spirit to the goals of eye-tracking methods, mouse-tracking may provide access to the micro-structure of perceptual, cognitive, and social decisions. Though both methodologies have their strengths, one advantage of mouse-tracking is that it relies on continuous streams of hand motion rather than discrete saccades, and it does so with nominal cost---needing nothing more than a computer and mouse. These qualities led Magnuson (2005, p.9996) to comment that the mouse-tracking technique [has] the potential to address not only specialized theoretical debates but also some of the biggest questions facing cognitive science.",>Jonathan Freeman>Rick Dale>Michael Spivey,">Tufts University>The University of Memphis>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0014/index.html

2011,"Space, Time and Causality: Some Neural Observations","Knowledge of events involves understanding the way that objects occupy space, exist in time, and relate to each other. I will consider behavioral, fMRI and lesion studies that explore how space, time and causality are structured and interact in our brains. Tentatively, I propose the following. 1) The perception and conception of space has a parallel organizational structure. Evidence for this claim comes from the finding that the distinction between path and manner of motion as expressed linguistically is also processed with an analogous dorsal ventral neural organization. 2) Perception of space and time can be tightly linked. Behavioral data show that we are spatial-temporal synaesthetes. The perception of spatial distance and the perception of temporal duration interact highly. 3) The right hemisphere is biased to process space and the left to process time despite bilateral overlap in neural underpinnings of these processes. This assertion is based on data from size discrimination and temporal order judgment tasks, which we regard as markers of space and time granularity. The hypothesis also bears out in data examining the contributions of space and time to perceptual causality. 4) Time, compared to space, has a privileged relationship to causality. In making judgments about perceptual causality, people are more sensitive to temporal offsets than to spatial deviations. When listening to short narratives with sequential events, the neural circuits engaged by causality subsumes neural circuits engaged by time much more so than the neural circuits engaged by space. Investigating interactions between space, time, and causality can reveal the rich texture of events.",>Anjan Chatterjee,">University of Pennsylvania

2011,Finding your way: The cognitive science of navigation,"One overarching research question in cognitive science concerns how information from perception and memory is processed and integrated in order to achieve robust, efficient, and adaptive behaviour in space, as is necessary in wayfinding. Examining this integration is quite complicated, entailing an understanding of learning strategies, spatial memory representations of static and dynamic relations, perceptual and attentional processes that direct the encoding and maintenance of select information, reasoning and planning processes, communication of spatial information via language or other representational media, the influence of background knowledge, and the development of navigation plans. Due to the complexity of the problem, research in navigation cuts across a diverse set of disciplines, including cognitive psychology, linguistics, computer science, robotics, environmental psychology, developmental psychology, and geography, and ranges from basic research questions to practical applications. This symposium presents research from across these disciplines, and provides a diversified overview of the range of issues involved.",>Benjamin Kuipers>Neil Burgess>Russell Epstein>Verner P.

2011,Does Teaching Experience Help? Differences in the Assessment of Tutees Understanding Between Teacher Tutors and Student Tutors,"Tutors often have difficulty in accurately assessing their tutees understanding. However, it is unclear how tutors professional experience influences their assessment accuracy. Therefore, we conducted a study with N = 46 tutor-tutee dyads and compared the accuracy with which teacher tutors and student tutors assessed a tutees understanding of the human circulatory system at the level of mental models. Results showed that both groups of tutors faced similar difficulties in assessing a tutees understanding. However, whereas teacher tutors assessment accuracy remained constant in the course of tutoring, student tutors assessment accuracy decreased. Moreover, teacher tutors more accurately self-assessed their assessment accuracy than student tutors. Although teacher tutors process diagnostic information more accurately than student tutors, both groups of tutors seem to be overwhelmed by processing all information making up a tutees mental model. Hence, regardless of their professional experience, tutors need to be supported in assessing a tutees understanding.",>Stephanie Herppich>Jörg Wittwer>Matthias Nückles>Alexander Renkl,">Institute for Science and Mathematics Education at the University of Kiel>University of Göttingen, Educational Institute>University of Freiburg, Department of Educational Science, Instructional and School Research>University of Freiburg, Department of Psychology, Developmental and Educational Psychology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0019/index.html
2011,Measuring Learning Progress via Self-Explanations versus Problem Solving - A Suggestion for Optimizing Adaptation in Intelligent Tutoring Systems,"Prior studies have shown that learning by problem solving in intelligent tutoring systems can be even more effective when worked examples are added compared to problem solving alone. Introducing self-explanation prompts additionally improves learning. Furthermore, recent findings indicate that fading out worked examples according to students performance during learning (i.e., adaptive fading) is even more beneficial than fading worked examples in a predefined procedure (i.e., fixed fading). In this contribution we investigate the relationship between potential indicators for learning progress and learning outcome. We found a stronger relationship of learning outcomes to self-explanation performance than to problem-solving performance during learning. Additionally, self-explanation performance is a stronger predictor for learning outcome than prior knowledge. Hence, adaptation, not only of the example fading procedure but potentially of other aspects of student learning might better be based on self-explanation performance and not (only) on problem-solving performance, as it is typical of ITS.",>Christine Otieno>Rolf Schwonke>Alexander Renkl>Vincent Aleven>Ron Salden,>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0020/index.html
2011,Exploring the Assistance Dilemma: The Case of Context Personalization,"Context personalization, the practice of matching features of an instructional component to a learners interests and experiences, has been framed in the literature as a means by which to improve learning by enhancing motivation. However, a related perspective could consider personalization a form of instructional assistance, with the potential to support the learning of new concepts. In this paper, the assistance dilemma, known to be ""a fundamental unsolved problem in cognitive science"" (Koedinger, Pavlik, McLaren, & Aleven, 2008, p. 2159), is investigated for context personalization. Two research studies explore whether personalization can be considered a form of assistance, and how this intervention mediates performance measures.",>Candace Walkington>Keith Maull,>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Colorado - Boulder,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0021/index.html
2011,An Investigation of Accuracy of Metacognitive Judgments during Learning with an Intelligent Multi-Agent Hypermedia Environment,"Research suggests that students are rather dysregulated in their learning. One major source of dysregulation is the inaccurate metacognitive judgments made during learning. This study investigated learners accuracy and confidence in metacognitive judgments made in the context of learning about the human circulatory system with MetaTutor, a multi-agent intelligent hypermedia learning system. 83 participants took part in this study, and their interactions within MetaTutor in the two-hour learning session provided data for this study. In general, the results revealed that learners were overconfident to differing degrees in their JOLs and FOKs. Moreover, receiving timely prompts and feedback from the artificial agent in MetaTutor improved the accuracy of metacognitive judgments. Learners in Prompt and Feedback condition (PF) were less overconfident than those in other conditions (Prompt Only [PO] and Control). Finally, analyses indicated that learners in PF condition attained significantly better learning efficiency scores than learners in Control and PO conditions.",>Reza Feyzi Behnagh>Zohreh Khezri>Roger Azevedo,>McGill University>McGill University>McGill University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0022/index.html
2011,Modeling Abstract Numeric Relations Using Concrete Notations,"Abstract relational reasoning is a core component of human thinking, and the formal algebraic equation is among the most powerful and general mechanisms for representing relations. It has often been assumed that the means by which expressions represent relations are purely semantic, and are encoded in an abstract syntax that governs the use of notation without regard to the details of its physical structure (Anderson, 2005; Hegarty, Mayer, & Monk, 1995). In contrast, we propose an image of equation construction that highlights the role of concrete physical relations in mediating the interpretation of equations. In this account, construction processes involve a structural alignment across representation systems. Alignment biases reasoners toward the selection of representations that maintain the concrete structure of source representations. We demonstrate that this approach accounts naturally for a variety of previously reported phenomena in equation construction, and correctly predicts several new phenomena.",>David Landy>David Brookes>Ryan Smout,>University of Richmond>Florida International University>University of Richmond,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0023/index.html
2011,Modeling Multitrial Free Recall with Unknown Rehearsal Times,"Quantitative models of human memory often rely on assumed latent memory processes, such as patterns of rehearsal of the words on a study list. Consequently, the application of memory models that assume latent rehearsals typically make use of overt rehearsal data. However, these data are not always available in some settings where the application of memory models has proven useful (e.g., clinical assessments of memory performance). In this paper, we show Bayesian statistical methodology can be used to infer the latent pattern of rehearsals needed to successfully apply a temporal model of memory to a clinical data set. We discuss the relevance of this research for those interested in neuropsychological assessment as well as cognitive psychologists interested in basic memory research.",>James Pooley>Michael Lee>William Shankle,">Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine>Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine>Medical Care Corporation",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0024/index.html
2011,Criterion Setting and the Dynamics of Recognition Memory,"A major puzzle in recognition memory has been the process by which participants set reasonable old/new decision criteria when the study and test lists are comprised of items of widely varying types, with differing degrees of baseline familiarity and experience (e.g., words vs. random dot patterns). We present a model of the recognition process that addresses this issue. Its core assumption is that recognition decisions are based not on the absolute value of familiarity, but on how familiarity changes over time as features are sampled from the test item. We model recognition decisions as the outcome of a race between two parallel accumulators: one that accumulates positive changes in familiarity (leading to an ""old"" decision) and another that accumulates negative changes (leading to a ""new"" decision). Simulations with this model make realistic predictions for recognition performance and latency regardless of the baseline familiarity of study and test items.",>Gregory Cox>Richard Shiffrin,">Indiana University, Bloomington>Indiana University, Bloomington",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0025/index.html

We analyzed the accuracy and reaction time data of participants performing of an adaptive n-back training task and developed a computational model to describe this performance. Application of our model to n-back training data suggests that performance is consistent with a two-stage, familiarity and recollection account. Furthermore, our results suggest that interference resolution is an important determining factor for task accuracy, especially when responding to targets.",>J. Isaiah Harbison>Sharona M.

2011,Construction in Semantic Memory: Generating Perceptual Representations With Global Lexical Similarity,"The literature currently contains a dichotomy in explaining how humans learn lexical semantic representations for words. Theories generally propose either that lexical semantics are learned through perceptual experience, or through exposure to regularities in language. We propose here a model to integrate these two information sources. The model uses the global structure of memory to exploit the redundancy between language and perception in order to generate perceptual representations for words with which the model has no perceptual experience. We test the model on a variety of different datasets from grounded cognition experiments.",>Brendan Johns>Michael Jones,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0027/index.html
2011,Does retrieval require effort? Effects of memory strength on pupil dilation.,"This study investigates the relation between retrieval effort and relative memory strength by measuring phasic pupil dilation during retrieval tasks. The facts were studied once and tested during four repetitions in one of two repetition-interval conditions. We hypothesized that retrieval effort will decrease as the relative strength of a memory trace increases. Analysis of the phasic pupil response in the experiment shows a significant main effect of repetition interval. Furthermore an interaction effect between the number of repetitions and repetition interval was found, indicating that the difference in effort between short and long repetition intervals decreased as the number of rehearsals increased. These findings largely confirm our hypotheses and the assumptions of theories that assume that increased retrieval effort increases learning gains.",>Jelle R.

2011,"Apparent Paradoxes in Moral Reasoning; Or how you forced him to do it, even though he wasnt forced to do it.","The importance of situational constraint for moral evaluations is widely accepted in philosophy, psychology, and the law. However, recent work suggests that this relationship is actually bidirectional: moral evaluations can also influence our judgments of situational constraint. For example, if an agent is thought to have acted immorally rather than morally, that agent is often judged to have acted with greater freedom and under less situational constraint. Moreover, when considering interpersonal situations, we judge that an agent who forces another to act immorally (versus morally) uses more force. These two features can result in contradictory response patterns in which participants judge both that (1) a forcer forced a forcee to act and (2) the forcee was not forced by the forcer to act. Here, we characterize potential psychological mechanisms, in particular, moral focus and counterfactual reasoning that account for this paradoxical pattern of judgments.",>Jonathan Phillips>Liane Young,>Yale University>Boston College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0029/index.html
2011,A Comparison of Nepalese and American Childrens Concepts of Free Will,"Recent work finds that children as young as four years old have an intuitive belief in free will. To what extent is this early-developing intuition universal, and to what extent culturally situated? We surveyed school-aged children (4-11) in two countries (Nepal and the United States) about their beliefs about peoples free will to follow personal preferences; break physical and mental constraints; and break social constraints. Results showed both universal and culturally-learned beliefs in free will. Children across cultures shared the early-developing intuitions of free will and constraint, though American children were more likely construe actions as choices. While American children were more likely to believe in the free will to break social constraints as they aged, Nepali children showed the opposite pattern. These findings show that while a basic notion of free will is present and early-developing across both cultures, construals of choice are also culturally learned over time.",>Nadia Chernyak>Tamar Kushnir>Katherine Sullivan>Qi Wang,>Cornell University>Cornell University>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0030/index.html
2011,Is Instinct Rational? Are Animals Intelligent? An Abductive Account,"The concept of abduction can be useful to clarify the conflict instinct vs. inference in cognitive science. The resulting idea that abduction is partly explicable as a biological instinctual phenomenon and partly as a more or less logical operation related to plastic cognitive endowments of all organisms naturally leads to stress that many animals  traditionally considered mindless organisms  intelligently make up a series of signs and are engaged in making, manifesting or reacting to a series of signs. An important effect of this semiotic activity is a continuous process of hypothesis generation that can be seen at the level of both instinctual behavior, as a kind of hardwired cognition, and representation-oriented behavior, where nonlinguistic pseudothoughts drive a plastic model-based cognitive role. Another important character of the abductive model-based cognitive activity above is the externalization of artifacts that play the role of mediators in animal languageless thinking.",>Lorenzo Magnani,">Department of Philosophy, University of Pavia

The argument is based on Searle's concept of ""direction of fit"" and the conditions of satisfaction of an intention. The conditions of satisfaction of an intention differ from those of a perception. If the intention involved in action is conscious, that conscious mental state cannot be exclusively perceptual.

In this way researchers have tried to assess the extent to which we can think rationally, and of course how we deviate from normative conventions. The fruit flies of this domain have been the Wason selection task (Wason, 1966), and Syllogistic reasoning tasks (Johnson-Laird, 1984). The field has advanced in helping us to understanding the influence of context on the kinds of inferences we tend to make, and we have gained significant insights into the kinds of situations in which our biased thinking is aligned with normative thinking and the situations in which it conflicts with it.",>Magda Osman>Wim De Neys,">Experimental Biology and Psychology Centre, Queen Mary University London

2011,Agency and Rhythmic Coordination: Are We Naught but Moving Dots?,"There is contention in perceptual-motor research concerning the degree to which observing biological and non-biological movements have equivalent effects on movement production. This issue results from the proposal that action observation and production share neural resources (i.e., mirror neurons) particularly sensitive to actions performed by other agents (i.e., beings with goals/intentions). In support of this claim, several discrete and rhythmic action-observation studies found that action production is only affected when participants believed that observed actions were produced by an agent. Here we present data from two experiments investigating whether similar agency manipulations also affect spontaneous movement synchrony. Collectively, the results suggest that belief in the agency of an observed movement does not affect the emergence and stability of rhythmic movement synchrony. These results question whether the actions of other agents are truly privileged across all scales of coordinated activity, particularly with respect to the lawful dynamics underlying movement synchrony.",>Charles Coey>Manuel Varlet>Richard Schmidt>Michael Richardson,">Center for Cognition, Action, and Perception, University of Cincinnati>Movement to Health, EuroMov, Montpellier University>Department of Psychology, College of the Holy Cross>Center for Cognition, Action, and Perception, University of Cincinnati",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0036/index.html
2011,Distributional and Temporal Properties of Eye Movement Trajectories in Scene Perception,"Eye movements gather visual information from the environment for various purposes and goals. Spatial patterns of eye movements vary depending on the layout of visual information, and intentions of the observer. However, despite this variability, basic principles of visual information gathering may be reflected in lawful properties of eye movement trajectories that hold across various stimulus and intentional conditions. Two experiments are presented analyzing eye movement trajectories during scene perception across pictures with varying spatial frequency distributions (Expt 1), and across two different task conditions, ""finding"" versus ""counting"" tasks (Expt 2). Results show that, in all conditions, distributions of saccade amplitudes are heavy-tailed and nearly identical in shape, and fixation fluctuation series are long-range correlated with nearly identical spectral slopes. While a small effect of task intention was found, the broader conclusion is that eye movements during scene perception exhibit general statistical characteristics that models have yet to address.",>Theo Rhodes>Christopher Kello>Bryan Kerster,>UC Merced>UC Merced>UC Merced,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0037/index.html
2011,Optimal Models of Human Multiple-Target Visual Search,"Unlike laboratory experiments, real-world visual search can contain multiple targets. Searching for an unknown number of targets creates a unique set of challenges for the observer, and often produces serious errors. We propose a Bayesian optimal foraging model to predict and describe behavior in such search scenarios, and investigate whether people adapt their search strategies based on complex statistics of target distributions. Separate groups searched arrays drawn from three target distributions with the same average number of targets per display, but different target-clustering properties. As predicted, participants searched longer when they expected more targets to remain and adjusted their expectations as searches unfolded, indicating that searchers are sensitive to the target distribution, consistent with both an optimal foraging framework and an ideal Bayesian observer. However, compared to the ideal observers, searchers systematically under-adjusted to the target distribution, suggesting that training could improve multiple-target search in radiology and other crucial applications.",>Matthew S.

2011,An Ideal Observer Model of Visual Short-Term Memory Predicts Human CapacityPrecision Tradeoffs,"We develop an ideal observer model of human visual short-term memory. Compared to previous models that have posited constraints on memory performance intended solely to account for observed phenomena, in the present research we derive the expected behavior of an optimally performing, but limited-capacity memory system. We develop our model using ratedistortion theory, a branch of information theory that provides optimal bounds on the accuracy of information transmission subject to a fixed capacity. The resulting model provides a task-independent and theoretically motivated definition of visual memory capacity and yields novel predictions regarding human performance. These predictions are quantitatively evaluated in an empirical study. We also demonstrate that our ideal observer model encompasses two existing, but competing accounts of VSTM as special cases.",>Chris R. Sims>Robert A. Jacobs>David C.

2011,Infants Use Social Signals to Learn from Unfamiliar Referential Cues,"Infants are bombarded with a bewildering array of events to learn. In such an environment, referential cues (e.g., gestures or symbols) highlight which events infants should learn. Although many studies have documented which referential cues guide attention and learning during infancy, few have investigated how this learning occurs. The present eye-tracking study provides clear evidence for a social scaffolding process: When preceded repeatedly by communicative signals (i.e., a face addressing the infant), 9-month-olds learned that arbitrary cues predicted the appearance of an audio-visual event. Importantly, the arbitrary cues continued to guide learning of these events, even after the face disappeared from the screen. A control condition confirmed that learning from arbitrary cues alone was unsuccessful, and that eventual success was not just due to extended practice. These results are discussed in terms of a theory of cue scaffolding.",>Rachel Wu>Natasha Kirkham>Kristen Swan>Teodora Gliga,">Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London>Birkbeck, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0040/index.html
2011,"Toddlers understanding of prediction, intervention, and means of transmission: When psychological outcomes are easier than physical ones","Adults recognize that if event A predicts event B, intervening on A might generate B. Research suggests that although preschoolers draw this inference much like adults, toddlers do not (Bonawitz et. al, 2010). Here we look at whether toddlers failure is domain-general (i.e., they lack an adult-like concept of causality that integrates prediction, intervention, and agency) or domain-specific (i.e., toddlers have trouble recognizing some physical processes as causal but might succeed with psychological events). We showed toddlers (24 months) a block moving into a base, after which an effect occurred; we then gave children the block and asked them to generate the effect. Toddlers performed the intervention and predicted the outcome when the effect was psychological (a puppet laughing) but, replicating previous studies, not when the effect was physical (a toy activating). Experiment 2 showed that this was not due to the relative saliency of the psychological effect.",>Paul Muentener>Daniel Friel>Laura Schulz,">Brain & Cognitive Sciences

2011,Ghosts of Theories Past: The Ever-Present Influence of Long-Discarded Theories,"When individuals replace their naïve theories of natural phenomena with more accurate, scientific ones, what happens to the original theories? Are they overwritten or merely suppressed? We investigated this issue by asking college undergraduates to verify two types of statements as quickly as possible: statements whose truth value was the same across naïve and scientific theories of the phenomena at hand (e.g., The moon revolves around the Earth) and statements whose truth value differed across those theories (e.g., The sun revolves around the Earth). Participants verified the former more quickly and more accurately than the latter, though this difference was smaller for early-developing domains (fractions, germs, inheritance, matter, physiology) than late-developing domains (astronomy, evolution, mechanics, thermodynamics, waves). These findings suggest that intuitive theories survive the acquisition of a mutually incompatible scientific theory, coexisting with, or even competing with, that theory for many years to come.",>Andrew Shtulman>Joshua Valcarcel,>Occidental College>Occidental College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0043/index.html

This code is obtained by computing the similarity between speech sounds and a large number of stored syllable-sized templates. We show that this code yields a better linear separation of phonemes than the standard MFCC code. Additional experiments show that the code is tuned to a particular language, and is able to use temporal cues for the purpose of phoneme recognition. Optimal templates seem to correspond to chunks of speech of around 120ms containing transitions between phonemes or syllables.",>Emmanuel Dupoux>Guillaume Beraud-Sudreau>Shigeki Sagayama,">Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris

2011,Multisensory Associative-Pair Learning: Evidence for Unitization as a specialized mechanism,"Learning about objects typically involves the association of multisensory attributes. Here, we present three experiments supporting the existence of a specialized form of associative learning that depends on unitization. When multisensory pairs (e.g. faces and voices) were likely to both belong to a single object, learning was superior than when the pairs were not likely to belong to the same object. Experiment 1 found that learning of face-voice pairs was superior when the members of each pair were the same gender vs. opposite gender. Experiment 2 found a similar result when the paired associates were pictures and vocalizations of the same species vs. different species (dogs and birds). In Experiment 3, gender-incongruent video and audio stimuli were dubbed, producing an artificially unitized stimulus reducing the congruency advantage. Overall, these results suggest that unitizing multisensory attributes into a single object or identity is a specialized form of associative learning.",>Elan Barenholtz>Meredith Davidson>David Lewkowicz,>Florida Atlantic University>Florida Atlantic University>Florida Atlantic University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0045/index.html
2011,The inception of simulation: a hypothesis for the role of dreams in young children,"In the present paper, we present an argument and an initial model connecting research into the functional role of dreams with simulation theories. Traditionally, although theories that describe the refinement of simulations exist, the origin of these simulations is not considered in detail. Similarly, research into the functional role of dreams tends to focus on adults, with less regard to the dreams of young children. Here, we suggest that a functional role of dreams in infants through to early childhood may be the inception of these simulations. We show that the proposed model can present a unified explanation for functions of both the phenomenological experience of dreaming as well as other aspects of brain activity during sleeping, e.g. the processing of memories. Additionally, it explicitly provides an account for the development of simulations in early childhood, hypothesising that an initial function of dreams is the inception and development of simulations.",>Serge Thill>Henrik Svensson,>University of Skövde>University of Skövde,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0046/index.html

These measures are total cue validity, feature possession score, and category utility. We compare these measures experimentally using stimuli from the Leuven Natural Concept Database (de Deyne et al., 2008). We find the measure developed from feature possession score, collocation, best captures human associations between concepts and features, followed by the measure developed from category utility, and finally the measure developed from total cue validity. We discuss how these results can be applied to open questions in categorization and similarity judgment such as domain differences in representation and modeling the effects of context.",>Matthew Zeigenfuse>Michael Lee,">Department of Psychology

We present two incremental models of category acquisition -- one probabilistic, one graph-based -- which encode different assumptions about how concepts are represented (i.e., as a set of topics or nodes in a graph). Evaluation against gold-standard clusters and human performance in a category acquisition task suggests that the graph-based approach is better suited at modeling the acquisition of natural language categories.",>Trevor Fountain>Mirella Lapata,>The University of Edinburgh>The University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0050/index.html

It is argued that the salience of information plays a crucial role in these effects. The present study investigates how different factors of salience affect speakers lexical and prosodic behaviour. Results indicate that those factors affect lexical use and prosody in different ways and, crucially, that adjectives signalling leaked information are prosodically more prominent, as measured by both by acoustic analysis and prominence ratings.",>Constantijn Kaland>Emiel Krahmer>Marc Swerts,">Tilburg centre for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), The Netherlands>Tilburg centre for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), The Netherlands>Tilburg centre for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), The Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0051/index.html

In the present study, insight problem solving was investigated with matchstick algebra problems. Participants were split in two groups. In the first, the paper group, they examined a static two-dimensional representation of the false algebraic expressions and told the experimenter which matchstick should be moved. The non-interactive procedure was similar to the one employed in Knoblich, Ohlsson, Haider, and Rhenius (1999). In the second group, the interactive group, participants manipulated a concrete three-dimensional representation of the false equations. Solution rates for participants in the interactive group were significantly higher than in the paper group. Problem solving success in the paper group was best predicted by performance on a numeracy test, whereas in the interactive group, it was best predicted by performance on a visuo-spatial reasoning test.",>Frederic Vallee-Tourangeau>Anna Weller>Gaelle Villejoubert,>Kingston University>Kingston University>Kingston University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0053/index.html

We test the benefits and costs of direct interaction with a mental arithmetic task in a computerized yoked design in which groups of participants vary in their interactive mode (move vs. look) and the initial configuration of coins (pseudo-random vs. another movers final layout). By assessing performance and conducting a microgenetic analysis of the strategies employed we argue that the purpose of movement is the result, rather than the process of moving. Participants move coins in order to sort, rather than to mark, and select them by value, rather than by location. They spontaneously create remarkably smart solutions, thereby incidentally creating physical configurations that can help other problem solvers.",>Hansjörg Neth>Stephen J.

Can we see systematic organization in the childrens behavior, and by extension, their cognition? Based on an account of cognition as embodied, situated, and culturally mediated, this research illustrates how some cognition can be directly observed, manifested through interactions among modalities, people and objects in a distributed cognitive system. This study uses micro- and macro-analyses of behavior recorded on video to discover organizing structure in childrens behavior and cognition, evidenced in allocation of visual and haptic attention, manipulation of objects, and use of written, spoken, and gestured language. At micro- and macro-scales, perceptual engagement with concrete objects precedes engagement with abstract concepts, as evidenced in motor behavior and content of speech and gesture. In this context, we describe learning as a process of adaptive coordination, rather than a product to be measured.",>Nancy Owens Renner,">University of California San Diego, San Diego Natural History Museum",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0055/index.html

How the pretest affects subsequent learning of other information is less clear. In three experiments, we examined the consequences of taking a multiple-choice pretest on the later recall of both pretested and non-pretested related information, finding that pretesting improved recall of pretested information without impairing recall of non-pretested information. In addition, we compared a pretest condition to conditions in which subjects were told to memorize the questions and in which subjects studied facts prior to reading. Although taking a pretest was not significantly more effective than memorizing questions or studying facts for the pre-exposed information, it did not impair the learning of related information, whereas studying facts did. Thus, even when a multiple-choice pretest takes time away from study, that pretest appears to make subsequent study more effective than other types of activities that pre-expose students to to-be-tested information.",>Jeri Little>Elizabeth Bjork,>UCLA>UCLA,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0058/index.html

Several approaches for designing learning materials to foster transfer of principles have been proposed including learning a generic instantiation, comparing instantiating concrete cases, and learning multiple representations. However, these approaches have rarely been tested against each other nor have they been examined by a broad range of transfer tasks. We evaluated the transfer potential of the different approaches separately (Experiment 1) and in combination (Experiment 2) by teaching undergraduates the principles of propositional logic. Students were tested on an extensive transfer test one week after learning. The best transfer performance resulted from the simultaneous comparison of a generic instantiation with two concrete cases.

We identified three types of comparison that are commonly utilized in mathematics instruction and learning: (1) problem-to-problem comparisons, (2) step-to-step comparisons, and (3) item-to-abstraction comparisons. Of these three types, only the effects of problem-to-problem comparisons on learning have been well documented.

The participants were 42 junior high school students who were assigned to a condition with peer instruction opportunities (experimental) or without (control). The peer instruction opportunities were designed to facilitate students diagram use in communication. The results revealed that, in post-instruction assessments, the experimental participants spontaneously used more diagrams and were more successful in problem solving. No differences were found in the timing with which participants started using diagrams. However, the experimental participants used more appropriate types of diagrams that also incorporated more relevant information. The findings therefore indicate that opportunities for peer communication with diagrams facilitate not only enhanced spontaneity in diagram use but also the construction of more appropriate, detailed diagrams, and these in turn likely contribute to better problem solving performance outcomes.",>Yuri Uesaka>Emmanuel Manalo,>The University of Tokyo>Waseda University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0061/index.html
2011,Functional Biases in Language Learning: Evidence from Word Order and Case-Marking Interaction,"Why do languages share structural properties? The functionalist tradition has argued that languages have evolved to suit the needs of their users. By what means functional pressures may come to shape grammar over time, however, remains unknown. Functional pressures could affect adults' production; or they could operate during language learning. To date, these possibilities have remained largely untested. We explore the latter possibility, that functional pressures operate during language acquisition. In an artificial language learning experiment we investigate the trade-off between word order and case. Flexible word order languages are potentially ambiguous if no case-marking (or other cues) are employed to identify the doer of the action. We explore whether language learners are biased against uncertainty in the mapping of form and meaning, showing a tendency to make word order a stronger cue to the intended meaning in no-case languages.",>Maryia Fedzechkina>T.

Words' distributional and phonological properties contribute to both adult and infant learning of grammatical categories. Here we investigate the contribution of semantic cues to the acquisition of grammatical categories using grammatical gender. Grammatical gender is traditionally considered a semantically arbitrary category, however there may be finer-grained correlations between semantic categories and gender classes. We taught adult native English speakers an artificial language with two gender-like classes, created via distributional, phonological and semantic properties. We demonstrate that the participants' performance on both an implicit and an explicit task is influenced by the semantic regularities in the two genders.

2011,Multimodal Transfer of Repetition Patterns in Artificial Grammar Learning,"Extending learned patterns to previously unseen ones is a key hallmark of complex cognition. This paper presents evidence that learners are able to generalize learned patterns to novel stimuli with very different surface properties within and across modalities. Using a statistical learning paradigm, adult learners were exposed to a repetition (reduplication) pattern in which the first element of a three-element sequence repeated (e.g., AB→AAB). The pattern was presented as either spoken repetition (e.g., bago, babago) or a non-linguistic visual analogue (i.e., repetition of non-nameable shapes). Learners showed significant transfer from a non-linguistic repetition pattern to a linguistic reduplication pattern, and vice versa. However, we found a small bias towards linguistic reduplication, as responses to linguistic patterns were numerically higher. This suggests that while learners are able to extend learned patterns to novel patterns in other domains, factors such as familiarity and naturalness may privilege linguistic patterns over non-linguistic analogues.",>Sara Finley>Morten Christiansen,>University of Rochester>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0064/index.html
2011,Storage and computation in syntax: Evidence from relative clause priming,"In morphology, researchers have provided compelling evidence for the storage of compositional structures that could otherwise be computed by rule. In syntax, evidence of storage of fully compositional structures has been less forthcoming. We approach this question using syntactic priming, a method exploiting the tendency of individuals to repeat recently produced syntactic structures. We investigate relative clauses (RCs), which are syntactically complex but are nevertheless frequent in natural language. Across three experiments, we observe that priming of object-extracted RCs is sensitive to a) the type of noun phrase in the embedded subject position (a full NP vs. a pronoun), and b) the type of relative pronoun (who vs. that). This suggests that the representations of some types of RCs involve storage of large units that include both syntactic and lexical information. We interpret these results as supporting models of syntax that allow for complex mixtures of stored items and computation.",>Melissa Troyer>Timothy J.

In contrast to the widely employed evolutionary model, which studies the dynamics of cooperation in a population of primitive players that lack memory, this paper examines the problem of cooperation in a population of memory-based players. Using computational simulations, it is shown that partial cooperation is maintained in a spatially structured population of players whose decision-making is effectuated by the adaptive nature of memory embodied in the ACT-R cognitive architecture (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998).",>Chenna Reddy Cotla,>George Mason University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0066/index.html
2011,Categorial compositionality continued: A category theory explanation for quasi-systematicity,"The classical account for systematicity of human cognition supposes: (1) syntactically compositional representations; and (2) processes that are sensitive to their structure. The problem with this account is that there is no explanation as to why these two components must be compatible, other than by ad hoc assumption (convention) to exclude nonsystematic variants that, e.g., mix prefix and postfix concatenative compositional schemes. Recently, we proposed an alternative explanation (Phillips & Wilson, 2010) without ad hoc assumptions, using a branch of mathematics, called category theory. Here, we extend our explanation to domains that are quasi-systematic (e.g., language), where the domain includes some but not all possible combinations of constituents. The central category-theoretic construct is an adjunction involving pullbacks, where the focus is on the relations between processes, rather than the representations. In so far as cognition is systematic, the basic building blocks of cognitive architecture are adjunctions by our theory.",>Steven Phillips>William Wilson,">National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan>The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0067/index.html
2011,"Learning to perceive time: A connectionist, memory-decay model of the development of interval timing in infants","We present the first developmental model of interval timing. It is a memory-based connectionist model of how infants learn to perceive time. It has two novel features that are not found in other models. First, it uses the uncertainty of a memory for an event as an index of how long ago that event happened. Secondly, embodiment  specifically, infant motor activity  is crucial to the calibration of time-perception both within and across sensory modalities. We describe the model and present three simulations which show (1) how it uses sensory memory uncertainty and bodily representaions to index time, (2) that the scalar property of interval timing (Gibbon, 1977) emerges naturally from this network and (3) that motor activity can synchronize independent timing mechanisms across different sensory modalities.",>Caspar Addyman>Robert French>Denis Mareschal>Elizabeth Thomas,">Université de Bourgogne>Université de Bourgogne>Birkbeck, University of London>Université de Bourgogne",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0068/index.html
2011,Racing for the City: The Recognition Heuristic and Compensatory Alternatives,"In the last decade a debate in the decision making literature has centered on the question whether decisions can be better described by simple non-compensatory heuristics or by more complex compensatory strategies. We argue that this debate should be led at a higher level of precision Theories about decision strategies are implemented at different levels of description and they often only make verbal, qualitative predictions. This makes it difficult to compare between them and to test them against quantitative process data. A way to make theories comparable and improve the precision of their predictions is to model them within one computational framework. Using the example of the recognition heuristic, we show how simplifying dichotomies such as the one between non-compensatory and compensatory decision strategies can dissolve when using detailed quantitative models.",>Katja Mehlhorn>Julian N.

2011,Naive Inference viewed as Computation,"Use of Bayesian models to explain both high- and low-level aspects of cognitive function promises better connections between cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience. But standing in the way are fundamental problems, such as the computational intractability of Bayesian inference, and the general difficulty of understanding how Bayesian calculation can deal with structural representation. Getting around the problem of intractability seems to involve devising effective methods for approximating optimal inference. But there is the alternative of simplifying the interpretation of how inference arises. While the process is normally taken to involve calculations over an implied joint distribution, it is possible to view it more simply as data-driven application of conditional assertions. This naive interpretation has several advantages with regard to tractability and representation. The paper formalizes the model and demonstrates some of its virtues.",>Chris Thornton,>University of Sussex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0070/index.html

2011,Which Parts of Scientific Explanations are Most Important?,"Given the depth and breadth of available information, determining which components of an explanation are most important is a crucial process for simplifying learning. Two experiments tested whether people believe that components of an explanation with more elaboration are more important. In Experiment 1, participants gave higher importance scores for components that they judged to be elaborated upon by many other components. In Experiment 2, the amount and type of elaboration was experimentally manipulated. Experiment 2 demonstrated that elaboration increases the importance of the elaborated information by providing insight into understanding the elaborated information; information that was too technical to provide insight into the elaborated component did not increase the importance of the elaborated component. While learning an explanation, people piece together the structure of elaboration relationships between components and use the insight provided by elaboration to identify important components.",>Benjamin Rottman>Frank Keil,>Yale University>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0072/index.html

Analysis of credibility judgment ratings revealed that older adults were less influenced by argument strength in content messages and contextual Website features than younger adults. Verbal protocol analysis revealed that older adults tended to accept the facts they read on the Web page instead of further deliberating on their credibility. They also tended to pay less attention to contextual Website features relevant to the credibility of the information. We also found that older adults lower sensitivity to credibility cues on a Web page could at least be partially explained by their declined cognitive ability and lack of Internet experience. On the other hand, health-related domain knowledge was found to be useful in helping older adults to make better credibility judgments.",>Q.

2011,Affective and Non-affective Meaning in Words and Pictures,"When people see a snake, they are likely to activate both affective information (e.g., dangerous) and non-affective information (e.g., animal). According to the Affective Primacy Hypothesis, the affective information has priority, and its activation can precede identification of the ontological category of a stimulus. Alternatively, according to the Cognitive Primacy Hypothesis, perceivers must know what they are looking at before they can make an affective judgment about it. We propose that neither hypothesis holds at all times. In two experiments, we show that the relative speed with which affective and non-affective information gets activated by words and pictures depends upon the contexts in which the stimuli are processed. These data support a view according to which words and pictures do not have meanings; rather, they are cues to activate patterns of stored knowledge, the specifics of which are co-determined by the item itself and the context in which it occurs.",>Vicky Tzuyin Lai>Peter Hagoort>Daniel Casasanto,">1.

2011,Reverse Appraisal: Inferring from Emotion Displays who is the Cooperator and the Competitor in a Social Dilemma,"We explore how emotion expression impacts emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas. Three experiments are described where participants play the prisoners dilemma with (computer) players that display emotion. Experiment 1 compares a cooperative player, whose displays reflect mutual cooperation, with a control player that shows no emotion. Experiment 2 compares a competitive player, whose displays reflect earning more points than the participant, and the control player. Experiment 3 compares the cooperative and competitive players. Results show that people: cooperate more with the cooperative than the control player; do not cooperate differently with the competitive and control players; and, cooperate more with the cooperative than the competitive player, when playing the latter first. We argue people infer, from emotion displays, the opponents propensity to cooperate by reversing the emotion appraisal process. Post-game surveys show that people interpret the displays according to appraisal variables consistently with predictions from appraisal theories of emotion.",>Celso de Melo>Peter Carnevale>Jonathan Gratch,">Institute for Creative Technologies, USC>USC Marshall School of Business>Institute for Creative Technologies, USC",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0075/index.html

Participants were video recorded while they solved difficult analytical reasoning problems after which they self-reported their affective states via a retrospective affect-judgment protocol. Time series of bodily motions were automatically extracted from the videos of participants faces and upper bodies via a motion filtering algorithm. Recurrence quantification analyses revealed that participants who reported increased levels of anxiety and frustration had less recurrent and deterministic movements compared to their counterparts. Importantly, these patterns could not be explained by the mere amount of movement or the variability in movement, but by non-obvious dynamical patterns in movement. We orient our findings towards theories that emphasize complex systems approaches to studying emotion.",>Sidney D'Mello,>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0076/index.html

2011,The Schematic Representation of Spatial Relations: Evidence from Group and Single-Case Lesion Studies,"To what extent are schematic representations neurally distinguished from language on the one hand, and from rich perceptual representations on the other? In a group lesion study, matching tasks depicting categorical spatial relations were used to probe for the comprehension of basic spatial concepts across distinct representational formats (words, pictures, schemas). Focused residual analyses using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) suggest that left hemisphere deficits in categorical spatial representation are difficult to distinguish from deficits in naming such relations, and that the right hemisphere plays a special role in extracting schematic representations from richly textured pictures. EE555, a patient with simultagnosia, performed six similar matching tasks. On the only two tasks that did not include matching to, or from, schemas, EE555 performed at chance levels. EE555 was significantly better on schema tasks, indicating that abstract analog representations make spatial relations visible in a manner that symbols and complex images do not.",>Alexander Kranjec>Prin Amorapanth>Anjan Chatterjee,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0079/index.html

Perspective priming was found both when speakers started with or without an individual preference. Priming occurred even after their partners switched from route to survey perspective descriptions, though not vice versa.

2011,A computational theory of human perceptual mapping,"This paper presents a new computational theory of how humans integrate successive views to form a perceptual map. Traditionally, this problem has been thought of as a straightforward integration problem whereby position of objects in one view is transformed to the next and combined. However, this step creates a paradoxical situation in human perceptual mapping. On the one hand, the method requires errors to be corrected and the map to be constantly updated, and yet, on the other hand, human perception and memory show a high tolerance for errors and little integration of successive views. A new theory is presented which argues that our perceptual map is computed by combining views only at their limiting points. To do so, one must be able to recognize and track familiar objects across views. The theory has been tested successfully on mobile robots and the lessons learned are discussed.",>Wai Yeap,">AUT University, New Zealand",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0081/index.html
2011,Beyond the retina: Evidence for a face inversion effect in the environmental frame of reference,"Across a wide range of face perception tasks, observers show drastically worse performance when faces are oriented upside-down versus upright. However, the meaning of orientation must be established in relation to a particular frame of reference. In relation to which reference frame(s) does the face inversion effect occur? Here we describe a simple, novel method for investigating potentially independent effects of retinal and environmental reference frames on face processing. Participants performed one of two face-processing tasks (emotional expression classification and recognition memory) as they lay horizontally, which served to disassociate the retinal and environmental reference frames. In both experiments we found a large effect of retinal orientation on performance and a small but reliable effect of environmental orientation. In a follow-up control study, we consider an alternative explanation based on our experimental setup. We argue that environmental orientation influences face processing, which is revealed when retinal orientation is kept constant.",>Nicolas Davidenko>Stephen Flusberg,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0082/index.html

For example, 8- and 11-month-old infants can make inferences from samples to populations and vice versa (Denison & Xu, 2010a; Xu & Garcia, 2008). The current experiment investigates the developmental origins of this probabilistic inference mechanism with 4- and 6-month-old infants. Infants were shown 2 large boxes, 1 containing a ratio of 4 pink to 1 yellow balls, the other containing the opposite ratio. The experimenter sampled from, e.g., the mostly pink box, and removed either 4 pink and 1 yellow or 4 yellow and 1 pink ball on alternating trials. 6- but not 4-month-olds looked longer at the 4 yellow and 1 pink ball sample (the improbable outcome) than the 1 yellow and 4 pink ball sample (the probable outcome).",>Stephanie Denison>Christie Reed>Fei Xu,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0083/index.html
2011,Learning to Balance a Beam: The Effect of Instability,"When presented with a problem-solving task, children sometimes fail to discern relevant pieces of information. Instead, they base their judgment on irrelevant information, sometimes ignoring corrective feedback. How could experience highlight relevant information? Using insights from complexity science, the current paper tests the usefulness of adding instability, or noise, to a childs experience. The idea is that an appropriate amount of instability flattens the attractor space of mistaken performance, allowing children to explore aspects of the environment perhaps considered irrelevant. To test this idea, we asked children between 4 and 9 years of age to place beams on a fulcrum where they would balance. Instability was conceptualized using beams for which the weight distribution was difficult to discern. While 4- to 5-year-olds and adults were unaffected by the noise manipulation, possibly for different reasons, 7- to 9-year-olds balanced the beams better when instability was at an intermediate level.",>David Pfeiffer>Heidi Kloos>Daniel Bullard,>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0084/index.html

The main results were that adults looked more to A and B than to C and Target and that they start with A and B before looking at C and D. For children, the pattern was very different.

As abduction is often an intractable task, it has been suggested that communicators alleviate the work of an addressee by performing recipient design, adapting their behavior to the presumed beliefs and knowledge of the addressee.

Existing accounts emphasize the importance of interaction, demonstrating how collaborative feedback leads to more systematized, stable and arbitrary referential conventions. However, co-ordination in dialogue requires both co-ordination of content and of process. To investigate procedural co-ordination we report a collaborative task which presents participants with the recurrent co-ordination problem of ordering their actions and utterances into a single coherent sequence. The results provide evidence of the development of group-specific procedural conventions, resulting in elliptical utterances whose communicative meaning is determined by their sequential location within the dialogue.",>Gregory Mills,">Stanford University

2011,Language evolution is shaped by the structure of the world: An iterated learning analysis,"Human languages vary in many ways, but also show striking cross-linguistic universals. Why do these universals exist? Recent theoretical results demonstrate that Bayesian learners transmitting language to each other through iterated learning will converge on a distribution of languages that depends only on their prior biases about language and the quantity of data transmitted at each point; the structure of the world being communicated about plays no role (Griffiths & Kalish, 2005, 2007). We revisit these findings and show that when certain assumptions about the independence of languages and the world are abandoned, learners will converge to languages that depend on the structure of the world as well as their prior biases. These theoretical results are supported with a series of experiments showing that when human learners acquire language through iterated learning, the ultimate structure of those languages is shaped by the structure of the meanings to be communicated.",>Amy Perfors>Daniel Navarro,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0089/index.html

To investigate the origins of this combinatorial structure, we conducted an iterated learning experiment with human participants, studying the transmission of an artificial system of sounds. In this study, participants learn and recall a system of sounds that are produced with a slide whistle, an instrument that is both intuitive and non-linguistic. The system they are exposed to is the recall output of the previous participant. Transmission from participant to participant causes the system to change and become cumulatively more learnable and more structured.

Instead, key symptoms are observed via language, including disorganized language and delusions. Underlying brain processes remain unclear; characterizing them would greatly enhance our understanding of schizophrenia. In this situation, computational models can be valuable tools to formulate testable hypotheses. This work aims to capture the link between biology and symptoms using DISCERN, a connectionist model of storytelling. Candidate illness mechanisms for schizophrenia are simulated and evaluated through narrative language, i.e. at the same level used to diagnose patients. The result is the first simulation of abnormal storytelling in schizophrenia, both in acute psychotic and compensated stages. Of all illness models, hyperlearning, a model of over-intense memory consolidation, produced the best fit to language abnormalities of stable outpatients, as well as compelling models of psychotic symptoms. If validated experimentally, the hyperlearning hypothesis could provide a platform for developing future treatments for schizophrenia.",>Uli Grasemann>Ralph Hoffman>Risto Miikkulainen,>University of Texas at Austin>Yale University>University of Texas at Austin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0091/index.html

2011,Effects of Filler-gap Dependencies Working Memory Requirements for Parsing,"Corpus studies by Schuler et al. (2010), appear to support a model of comprehension taking place in a general-purpose working memory store, by providing an existence proof that a simple probabilistic sequence model over stores of up to four syntactically-contiguous memory elements has the capacity to reconstruct phrase structure trees for over 99.9% of the sentences in the Penn Treebank corpus, in line with capacity estimates for general-purpose working memory, e.g. by Cowan (2001). But capacity predictions of this simple structure-based model ignore non-structural dependencies, such as long-distance filler-gap dependencies, that may place additional demands on working memory. Distinguishing unattached gap fillers from open attachment sites in syntactically-contiguous memory elements requires this contiguity constraint to be strengthened to a constraint that working memory elements be semantically contiguous. This paper presents corpus results showing that this stricter semantic contiguity constraint still predicts working memory requirements in line with capacity estimates.",>William Schuler,>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0093/index.html

We implement the idea of a semantic-episodic memory integration in a probabilistic grammar, and evaluate its performance as a syntactic parser on corpora of natural language.

Our first experiment explores how humans learn relational concepts such as ""taller"" that are defined with respect to a context set. Our second experiment explores modal inferences, or inferences about whether states of affairs are possible or impossible.

But languages vary dramatically in how they carve up the world by name. Either ordinary concepts must be heavily language-dependent or names cannot be a direct route to concepts. We asked English, Dutch, Spanish, and Japanese speakers to name videos of human locomotion and judge their similarities. We investigated what name inventories and scaling solutions on name similarity and on physical similarity for the groups individually and together suggest about the underlying concepts. Aggregated naming and similarity solutions converged on results distinct from the answers suggested by any single language.

A priming experiment was conducted to investigate the relations between singular representations of famous individuals from four categories (person, building, artwork and product), contrasting associative and categorical priming effects in visual recognition. The experiment adopted a familiarity decision task to compare priming by associates (e.g. Michelle Obama - Barack Obama) and priming by non-associates from the same semantic category (e.g. Angelina Jolie - Johnny Depp) against an unrelated prime condition. The results of the experiment showed that there was a substantial priming effect from associates but no reliable priming from non-associates of the same semantic category.

According to the SD-GCM, typicality is determined by both the summed similarity towards all category members and the summed dissimilarity towards members of contrast categories.

2011,The Thickness of Musical Pitch: Psychophysical evidence for the Whorfian hypothesis,"Do the languages that people speak affect the way they think about musical pitch? Here we compared pitch representations in native speakers of Dutch and Farsi. Dutch speakers describe pitches as high (hoog) and low (laag), but Farsi speakers describe high-frequency pitches as thin (naazok) and low-frequency pitches as thick (koloft). Differences in language were reflected in differences in performance on two psychophysical pitch reproduction tasks. This was true even though the tasks used entirely nonlinguistic stimuli and responses. To test whether experience using language changes pitch representations, we trained native Dutch speakers to use Farsi-like metaphors, describing pitch relationships in terms of thickness. After training, Dutch speakers performance on a nonlinguistic psychophysical task resembled native Farsi speakers. People who use different space-pitch metaphors in language also think about pitch differently. Beyond correlation, language plays a causal role in shaping mental representations of musical pitch.",>Sarah Dolscheid>Shakila Shayan>Asifa Majid>Daniel Casasanto,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, NL

2011,Humans use different statistics for sequence analysis depending on the task,"Despite its long history (Luce, 1986) the study of sequential effects has mostly been confined to simple binary tasks such as two-alternative forced choice tasks (2AFC). Here we present experimental results from a choice task with three rather than two alternatives (3AFC) as well as a novel model that can explain them. We find that humans change the statistics they use to analyse a sequence depending on the task constraints, relying on first-order transition probabilities in a 2AFC but event relative frequencies (i.e., zeroth-order transition probabilities) in a 3AFC.",>Dinis Gokaydin>Anna Ma-Wyatt>Daniel Navarro>Amy Perfors,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0100/index.html
2011,Examining the Role of Object Size in Judgments of Lateral Separation,"Research on depth judgments has found a small but significant effect of object size on perceived depth (Gogel & Da Silva, 1987). Research on judgments of separation (e.g., Levin & Haber, 1993), however, has found that visual angle is the predominant determiner of exocentric distance judgments. The goal of the present research was to examine the influence of object size on judgments of lateral separation using a one-shot change detection paradigm. Experiment 1 used a forced-choice response, finding a significant influence of object size on distance judgments. Experiment 2 replicated these results using a distance reproduction task. These results are discussed in terms of Gogel and Da Silvas (1987) Theory of Off-Sized Perceptions.",>Robert Thomson>Guy Lacroix,>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0101/index.html
2011,"Basic Information Processing Effects from Perceptual Learning in Complex, Real-World Domains","Recent research indicates that perceptual learning (PL) interventions in real-world domains (i.e., mathematics, science) can produce strong learning gains, transfer, and fluency. Although results on domain-relevant assessments suggest characteristic PL effects, seldom have real-world PL interventions been explicitly tested for their effects on basic information extraction. We trained participants to classify Chinese characters, based on either (1) overall configurations (structures), (2) featural relations (components), or (3) non-relational information (stroke-count control). Before and after training, we tested for changes in information extraction using a visual search task. Search displays contained all novel exemplars, involved manipulations of target-distractor similarity using structures and components, and included heterogeneous and homogeneous distractors. We found robust improvements in visual search for structure and component PL training relative to the control. High-level PL interventions produce changes in basic information extraction, and sensitivity induced by PL for both relational structure and specific components transfers to novel structural categories.",>Khanh-Phuong Thai>Mettler Everett>Kellman Philip,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0102/index.html
2011,The algorithmization of counterfactuals,"One of the most striking phenomenon in the study of conditionals is the ease and uniformity with which people generate, evaluate and interpret counterfactual utterance. To witness, the majority of people would accept the statement: ``If Oswald didn't kill Kennedy, someone else did,'' but few, if any, would accept its subjunctive version: ``If Oswald hadn't killed Kennedy, someone else would have.'' I will present a computational model that explains how humans reach such consensus or, more concretely, what mental representation permits such consensus to emerge from the little knowledge we have about Oswald, Kennedy and 1960's Texas, and what algorithms would need to be postulated to account for the swiftness, comfort and confidence with which such judgments are issued. The model presented is compatible with the ""possible world"" account of Lewis (1973), yet it enjoys the advantages of representational economy, algorithmic simplicity and conceptual clarity. Armed with these advantages, I will then present a panoramic view of several applications where counterfactual reasoning has benefited problem areas in the empirical sciences, including policy evaluation, causal-pathways mapping, credit and blame analysis, and personal decision making.",>Judea Pearl,">Computer Science Department

2011,Coordinating Touch and Vision to Learn What Objects Look Like,"We use contemporary machine learning methods to explore Piaget's idea that active interaction across modalities may be the engine for constructing knowledge about objects. Modality-specific invariances are explored as a potential mechanism by which Piaget's ideas may be implemented in practice. For example, object segmentation and pose invariant recogntion are difficult in the visual domain but trivial in the tactile/proprioceptive domain; touching an object easily delineates its physical boundaries. We can also rotate an object without modifying the proprioceptive and tactile information from our hands. This information may provide invariants that could be useful for training a visual system to recognize and segment objects. We developed the instrumentation necessary to simultaneously collect tactile, proprioceptive and visual information of a person interacting with eveyday objects. We then developed a system that learns pose invariant visual representations using proprioceptive and tactile information as the only training signal.",>Walter Talbott>Ian Fasel>Javier Molina>Virginia de Sa>Javier Movellan,>UCSD>University of Arizona>UCSD>UCSD>UCSD,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0104/index.html
2011,When Lighting a Candle Becomes a Superstition: Analogical Recategorization through the Application of Relational Categories,"In this paper we proposed a new classification of analogical mechanisms of representational change and gathered evidence of the operation of one of the new ones that we proposed: recategorization of events. We carried out two experiments to assess whether an analogy can trigger the recategorization of a target analog (TA). More specifically, the experiments were designed to test whether a TA not initially regarded as a member of a schema relational category can be perceived as belonging to such category as a result of being paired with a base analog (BA) consisting of a typical exemplar of that category. Results in both experiments showed that having paired an atypical TA with a typical BA favored the use of the base category to describe the TA. Implications for traditional and future proposals of mechanisms of analogical representation change are discussed.",>Nicolás Oberholzer>Máximo Trench>Ricardo Minervino,">Universidad de Buenos Aires

2011,"Unifying Deduction, Induction, and Analogy by the AMBR Model","This paper presents a series of simulations performed with the AMBR model that demonstrate how deduction, induction, and analogy can emerge from the interaction of several simple mechanisms. First, a case of deductive reasoning is demonstrated when a problem is solved based on general knowledge. The system represents the target in different ways depending on the goal, and different solutions are generated. Second, the constructed solutions of the problems are remembered and later on used as a base for remote analogy. Finally, on the basis of the analogy made, a generalized solution of the class of problems is induced. One important characteristic of the model is that representation of the task, problem-solving, and learning are not viewed as separate modules. Instead, they are different aspects of one and the same joined work of the basic mechanisms of the architecture.",>Georgi Petkov>Ivan Vankov>Boicho Kokinov,">Department of Cognitive Science and Psychology, New Bulgarian University>Department of Cognitive Science and Psychology, New Bulgarian University>Department of Cognitive Science and Psychology, New Bulgarian University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0106/index.html
2011,"Exploring Visual Attention in Musicians: Temporal, Spatial and Capacity Considerations","Considerable evidence converges on how attention can be modulated through training (e.g., video game playing). While previous research suggests that musical training can modulate early perceptual and attentional processes, no single investigation to date has been conducted on the same participants to measure specific mechanisms of attention (temporal, spatial, and capacity) in musicians. In Experiment 1 we used a temporal order judgment (TOJ) task with both exogenous and endogenous cues in order to measure temporal and spatial attention. In Experiment 2, a cued-target detection task was presented with a concurrent high load task to assess capacity processing in musicians. Of the three measures, musicians performed better than controls on two, demonstrating a lower threshold for judging temporal order in addition to increased capabilities to process distracting information despite attentional resources being largely depleted. Together, these results provide novel findings on multiple aspects of attention in musicians.",>Ahnate Lim>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0107/index.html
2011,Forward Physics: How people learn and generalize novel dynamical models,"Intuitive theories of physics govern the everyday action of humans. Studies with children and the ability of adults to adapt to novel physical situations suggest this knowledge might be learned, but how can physics be learned? We consider different physical models of dynamic situations as generated from an underlying physical theory defined over Spelke-like objects. This allows us to go from the observed dynamics of objects (e.g. particles and positions) to the underlying physical model governing the interaction between the objects (e.g. a spring in a gravity well). The underlying theory is then used to predict and generalize object properties and interactions in new scenarios. We compare these predictions and generalizations to those of humans faced with the same unfolding dynamics. We argue that this generative model of physics can explain the ability of humans to learn and generalize novel dynamics.",>Tomer Ullman>Noah Goodman>Josh Tenenbaum,>MIT>Stanford>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0108/index.html
2011,The Onset of Syntactic Bootstrapping in Word Learning: Evidence from a Computational Study,"The syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis suggests that children's verb learning is guided by the structural cues that the linguistic context provides. However, the onset of syntactic bootstrapping in word learning is not well studied. To investigate the impact of linguistic information on word learning during early stages of language acquisition, we use a computational model of learning syntactic constructions from usage data, and adapt it to the task of identifying target words in novel situations. Our results show that having access to linguistic information significantly improves performance in identifying verbs (but not nouns) in later stages of learning, yet no such effect can be observed in earlier stages.",>Afra Alishahi>Pirita Pirita Pyykkönen,>Saarland University>Saarland University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0109/index.html
2011,Modeling Verb Lexicalization Biases using Hierarchical Bayesian Models,"The expression of motion verbs differs between languages. The path of motion, such as crossing or entering, is more prominently featured in path-based languages such as Spanish than in manner-based languages such as English. Here, we revisit the data from a study on manner and path biases in verb lexicalization, and create a hierarchical Baysian computational model to further explore, verify, and define these biases. With this model, we can discover the large differences in subjects' pre-existing manner and path biases that depend on the syntactic frame in which new verbs appear, as well as a difference in the learning rate between English speakers taking the experiment in English and bilingual Spanish speakers taking the experiment in Spanish. We can also use the model to predict the responses of subjects in the experiment with more accuracy than before.",>Catherine Havasi>Robert Speer,>MIT Media Lab>MIT Media Lab,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0110/index.html

Recently she and her colleagues reported data from a different task to support the claim (Boroditsky, Fuhrman, & McCormick, 2010). We repeated their study with English speakers in US, Mandarin speakers in Taiwan and Mandarin speakers in China. The Mandarin speakers in Taiwan showed an opposite pattern of results than the English speakers, but the Mandarin speakers in China performed similarly to the English speakers. These results are interpreted as reflecting differences in orthographic directionality adopted in different linguistic communities, uniformly horizontal in US and China, but horizontal mixed with vertical in Taiwan.

2011,Dreaming Cogniton and Acculturation Processes,"The author suggests that dreaming cognition be modeled as reflecting dynamic, integrative, culturally-sensitive, and historically holistic methods. The author conceptualizes six models of dreaming cognition. 1) Freudian dreaming model, 2) Jungian analytic model, 3) neurocognitive or neurophysiological dreaming model, 4) acculturative dreaming brain model (Sang Bok Lee, 2005: Lee Acculturation Dream Scale, Psychological Reports, 96), 5) Cognitive-experiential model, and 6) narrative meaning-making model. Neurocognitive dreaming model (dreaming brain model) has been a turning point to rehabilitate Freudian and Jungian models in terms of recent neuroscientific experimentation and verification utilizing clinical patients. Acculturative dreaming brain model complements cross-cultural scheme of dream interpretation by using Korean-American college students dreams. Cognitive-experiential model (focusing method) and narrative meaning-making model (story-telling and thematic analysis, Lee Cross-cultural Dream Anxiety Scale  Sang Bok Lee) provide some critical hermeneutics for dream interpretation.",>Sang Bok Lee,>Kangnam University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0112/index.html
2011,Syntactic Biases in Intentionality Judgments,"Abstract: The notion of a thematic role has been an important one in linguistic theories concerning the syntax/semantics interface (Fillmore, 1968), but their effects on high-level cognition remain relatively unexplored. Thematic roles,like AGENT and PATIENT, are said to be linked with specific grammatical positions like that of subject and direct object. Here we ask if the link between grammatical subjects and the thematic role AGENT might create an intentionality bias for subjects. We tested this in a series of studies examining both response times and accuracy. These studies reveal a quick and reflexive bias to treat grammatical subjects (but not prepositional objects or direct objects) as being more intentional than they actually are. However, this bias may be overcome when people are encouraged to reflect on their true knowledge. Broader implications of our findings for research in psychology and linguistics are discussed.",>Brent Strickland>Matt Fischer>Elodie Peyroux>Frank Keil,>Yale University>Biola University>Universite de Lyon>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0113/index.html
2011,Color Language Does Not Affect Chromatic Thresholds,"Speakers of languages that differ in their color vocabulary perform differently on a range of supra-threshold categorization tasks and these variations are predicted by their respective color vocabulary. Here we compare two language groups (English and Herero) who have different color vocabularies for the green-blue region of color space. Discrimination thresholds were compared for English and Herero color boundaries using a perceptual task that was unlikely to involve the activation of verbal codes. This enabled an assessment of whether color perception is modulated by color language, rather than color language merely having an online influence on performance, as shown by supra-threshold tasks. The pattern of discrimination thresholds was the same for English and Herero speakers. Discrimination thresholds were not consistent across test points but there was no evidence of lowered discrimination at either the English or Herero boundary. These findings suggest that color language does not affect chromatic thresholds.",>Alexandra Clifford>Paul T. Sowden>Ian R.L.

2011,The Significance of Memory Retrieval in Perceptual Interference,"Verbal overshadowing is a phenomenon where verbalizing a nonverbal experience produces an inaccurate memory of the experience. Drawing from perceptual symbol systems, we postulate that verbal overshadowing belongs to the larger phenomenon of perceptual interference. Verbalizing or mentally imaging nonverbal experiences produces inaccurate memories of those experiences. This is because people initially form prototypical representations of nonverbal experiences. These prototypical representations are not always identical to later exemplars of the experience. On perceiving an exemplar and later having to remember it, people may retrieve inaccurate prototypical representations instead. To test this, we developed a visual interference paradigm that uses fictional spy devices. Previous experiments have shown that peoples prototypical representations interfere with their memories for the veridical exemplars, and that it occurs with verbalization or with mental imagery. The current experiment investigates whether perceptual interference occurs during memory encoding, retrieval, or both. Results indicate that it may occur during retrieval.",>Ava Santos>Lawrence Barsalou,>Fort Lewis College>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0115/index.html

This study proposes a cognitive research of RQs under the Prototype Theory of Categorization, aiming to provide a systematic analysis of RQs. In the first part, I suggest that a cognitive analysis of RQs under the Prototype Theory of Categorization can perfect the analyzing system of RQs. In the second part, the proposed theoretical frame and some colloquial data collected from the situation comedy Everybody Loves Raymond are employed to analyze the pragmatic prototypical categories of RQs.

2011,Towards a Categorization-Based Model of Similarity,"Most accounts of categorization assume the categorization decision for an item to be independent of the categorization decisions for other items. A number of methods are brought to bear on the question of whether this assumption is justified. These methods involve the application of a formal categorization model that explicitly incorporates the independence assumption to categorization data and the subsequent investigation of the residuals for unexplained structure. The residuals reveal multiple departures from independence, suggesting that the independence assumption in many a categorization account should be relaxed. Following this suggestion the applied formal model is extended to allow for dependent categorization decisions. It is explained how the extended model might address the concern that categorization accounts have erred in using similarity as an explanatory construct. It promises to be a significant step towards a categorization-based model of similarity.",>Steven Verheyen>Gert Storms,>University of Leuven>University of Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0117/index.html

Results that support this theory were generally obtained with artificial materials learned in laboratory experiments. In the current experiment, we extend these findings to real artifacts that occur naturally outside the laboratory. We presented participants of different levels of expertise, with real artifacts that cohered to different degrees with a proposed design history, and participants rated either the artifacts efficiency for the proposed design history function, or the credibility of the received story about their design history. Our results showed that coherent design histories are more credible, that expertise increases the ability to judge efficiency (not surprisingly), but that expertise does not affect the ability to judge credibility to the same extent that it affects efficiency.

2011,What Varying the Learning Task and Category Structure Reveals About Inference Learning,A core issue in the cognitive sciences is understanding how people acquire conceptual knowledge. One way that people can acquire this knowledge is through the inference of missing feature information. Recent studies have proposed a shift away from the idea that inference learning results in knowledge of the internal structure of the categories being learned. The current study varies the inference learning task and the category structure being learned in order to examine these claims. The results provide little support for the notion that participants are acquiring either exemplar knowledge or a simple set of rules as a result of inference learning.,>Seth Chin-Parker,>Denison University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0119/index.html
2011,Observational Category Learning as a Path to More Robust Generative Knowledge,"Models and theories of category learning may exaggerate the extent to which people adopt discriminative strategies because of a reliance on the traditional supervised classification task. In the present experiment, this task is contrasted with supervised observational learning as a way of exploring differences between discriminative and generative learning. Categories were defined by a simple unidimensional rule with a second dimension that was either less diagnostic (than the simple rule on the first dimension) or non-diagnostic. When the second dimension was less diagnostic, observational learners were more sensitive to its distributional properties compared to classification learners (though classification accuracy at test did not differ). Observational learners were also consistently more sensitive to distributional information about the highly diagnostic dimension. When the second dimension was non-diagnostic, neither learning group showed sensitivity to the distributional properties of this dimension.",>Kimery R. Levering>Kenneth J.

This research explores how two types of informationperceptual and conceptualmay be used to different extents in different tasks. The method takes advantage of the distinction between animate and artifact categories. In two experiments, adult participants were given perceptual and conceptual information about the animacy of novel categories, and then were tested on three tasks. Participants categorized items by classifying with a given novel name, with a given fact, or by inferring untrained facts about the items. Results showed that participants used different sources of information depending on the task.

2011,Types of Cognitive Content and the Role of Relational Processing in the Illusion of Explanatory Depth,"Rozenblit and Keil (2002) claim that people are subject to an illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) whereby they believe they understand the world in greater detail, coherence and depth than they actually do. In the present research, we questioned Rozenblit and Keils conclusions in two ways. First, we tested whether people might overestimate their explanatory knowledge as a result of misconstruing how to initially rate their understanding of stimuli. We found that when directed to consider the physical-mechanical processes of stimuli instead of their functional affordances, participants did in fact offer more accurate estimates of understanding relative to their explanatory performance. Second, we tested whether the explanations participants proffer are misleadingly shallow. We predicted that by encouraging a more relational encoding of stimuli, participants would be able to produce better explanations. However, the results showed that participants explanations remained shallow after relationally encoding stimuli.",>Graham Silk-Eglit>Kenneth Kurtz,>Binghamton University>Binghamton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0122/index.html

The typical procedure for such experiments has been to compare category labeling to a non-categorization encoding task such as a preference judgement. In a series of experiments, we examine alternative comparison tasks that attempt to control the depth of encoding and the degree to which category information is explicitly recruited at the time of study. The results appear most consistent with a depth of processing (Craik & Lockhart, 1972) (Exp. 1) or distinctiveness (Exp. 2) explanation for the pattern of memory effects found in previous studies.",>Nathaniel Blanco>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0123/index.html
2011,Priming Effects of Religious Concepts on Moral Judgment: Between Mean Values and Variation,"Social psychological researchers have found that most conceptual structures can be primed, i.e. activated unobtrusively and exert an influence on subsequent behavior without the participants awareness of this influence. I investigated whether exposing people to words related to a punishing God or a forgiving Christian could influence subsequent moral judgment. Participants completed a 'scrambled sentence' task before rating five vignettes concerning various moral transgressions. Analysis showed that participants in the 'forgiving' condition on average made slightly less severe moral judgments than did participants in both the 'punishing' condition and a control condition. Whereas previous religious priming studies have often treated religious concepts as a homogenous category with homogenous priming effects, the current experiment questions that assumption. Also, the study incorporated a measure of participants' associations with the prime words, revealing considerable variation. This suggests that participants different interpretations of religious words are an important topic and concern for future studies.",>Ulrik Lyngs,">Department for the Study of Religion, and Department of Psychology, Aarhus University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0124/index.html

All elements except visual input and motor output are implemented using 150,000 LIF spiking neurons. Properties of these neurons (firing rate, post-synaptic time constant, etc.) are set based on the neurons in corresponding areas of the brain, and connectivity is similarly constrained. Cortical components are all general-purpose modules (for storing state information and for storing and retrieving short-term memories of previous state information), and could be used for other tasks. The only task-specific components are particular synaptic connection weights from cortex to basal ganglia and from thalamus to cortex, which implement 19 context-specific rules. The model has a single free parameter (the synaptic connection weights of the input to short-term memory), and produces timing behaviour similar to that of human participants.",>Terrence Stewart>Chris Eliasmith,>University of Waterloo>University of Waterloo,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0125/index.html

This paper describes a framework for human cognition that is based on empirical evidence for the role of prediction in cognition, and discusses how computational models might be derived from the framework. The framework continually produces and verifies predictions of its input data. A description is given of how a particular instance of the framework might be developed that can aid financial analysts in predicting the value of a time series of asset prices. A plan is outlined for how models derived from the framework might be trained.

This research reduced the information-processing demands of writing by using dictations to examine awareness of a readers ignorance. Children aged 5 to 7 years dictated various pairs of letters (e.g., about playing in the snow to a child who had never seen snow versus a Canadian child). Results showed that only a quarter of the 5-year-olds, half the 6-year-olds, but most 7-year-olds showed evidence of ToRM. There were significant correlations between ToRM, ToM and Executive Function, however, on a measure of ratio of changes to total words, with age partialed out, correlations with ToM and Executive Function were no longer significant.

2011,Extracting statistical relations from noisy visual scenes,"When young infants are presented with statistical patterns in an extremely sparse environment, they demonstrate remarkable skill for learning deterministic relations among visual and auditory features (Kirkham et al., 2002; Fiser & Aslin, 2002; Saffran et al., 1996). While statistical learning is suggested to support complex skills such as object processing and language, previous studies have failed to test its robustness amid variability and distraction typical of the natural world. Variations in sequence probability have been shown to modulate infants attention (Kidd et al., 2010) and are therefore predicted to impact learning. In an eye-tracking study, 8-month-olds were presented with sequences of visual events that differed within-subjects in their transitional probabilities from deterministic to random and differed between-subjects in the presence or absence of noise events. Results suggest that infants are indeed able to learn visual patterns with probabilistic transitions, but their learning is differentially affected by increases in noise.",>Kristen Swan>Natasha Kirkham,">Birkbeck College, University of London>Birkbeck College, University of London",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0128/index.html
2011,Incomplete sampling leads to broader category generalizations in preschoolers,"Recent research demonstrates young children are particularly sensitive to how samples are generated (Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007). For example, children readily adjust their inferences in response to violations of intentional sampling (e.g., naïve and accidental sampling). However, even well-reasoned intentional sampling processes can be perturbed by external contextual factors, such as an interruption resulting in incomplete sampling. Here we explore how an interruption to intentional sampling affects preschoolers category learning and generalizations. In Study 1, children observed sampled evidence about a simple unstructured category. Study 2 placed added inferential demands on children through use of a more complex similarity-based category structure and abstracting the sampling process. In both studies, interrupted sampling led to broader generalization than completed sampling given equivalent evidence. The findings contribute to a growing body of literature demonstrating childrens sensitivity to the pragmatics of sampling contexts in inductive inference.",>Andrew G. Young>Sunae Kim>Charles W.

Sample But Not Population Statistics,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether sampling procedure affected childrens inferences about populations or samples or both. In two experiments children learned to predict the color of a toy from its shape. In the first experiment a deceptive or honest teacher sampled the toys, while the second contrasted random and non-random sampling (using a magnetic wand to select from a population with only some magnetic toys). We found no difference between the inferences made about the population and the sample in the helpful or random condition. In the deceptive or nonrandom condition, children were less accurate/confident about inferences made about the population than the sample. This effect held only for the trained predictions (color given shape). We did not see this pattern for reverse inferences (shape given color). Children were more likely to generalize given helpful sampling, but seemed to focus more specifically on the trained relations.",>Jordan Thevenow-Harrison>Charles Kalish,>University of Wisconsin-Madison>University of Wisconsin-Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0130/index.html
2011,Experience Modifies Neural Basis of Language: Evidence from Early-Blind Children,"Humans are hypothesized to have evolved brain regions that enable them to acquire language. Surprisingly, recent research with blind adults suggests that brain regions in the occipital lobe, which evolved for vision, can take on language functions. We examined when and why occipital areas develop language functions. We used fMRI to measure brain activity during story comprehension in nine blind and twenty sighted children (ages 4-17 years). In two control conditions, children listened to speech in foreign languages and short music clips. We found that occipital brain regions respond to story comprehension more than to foreign languages or music. A language-sensitive response was present in blind children as young as 4 years old, who have not yet learned Braille. We conclude that in the absence of visual input, occipital brain regions can take on language functions during childhood language acquisition.",>Marina Bedny>Hilary Richardson>Rebecca Saxe,>MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences>MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences>MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0131/index.html
2011,The role of adult input on numeracy development,"This research investigated the role of adult mathematically-related talk and gesture on childrens numeracy development. Though mathematically-rich input provided by parents and teachers has been found to relate to childrens emergent numeracy skills (LeFevre, Clarke, & Stringer, 2002; Klibanoff et al., 2006), little is known about the role of gesture during math talk on childrens early mathematics development. Twelve boys and 12 girls between 26 and 32 months old and their parents participated in a 30-minute free play session at home. Instances of the five types of math talk and ten types of gesture during math talk were coded. The childrens mathematics abilities were also assessed using TEMA-3 (Ginsburg & Baroody, 2003) a year later. Results from the multiple regression revealed that adult math talk but not gestural use along with child math talk and gesture significantly predicted childrens mathematics abilities [F(6,12) = 5.02, p = 0.009, R2 = 0.72].",>Joanne Lee>Donna Kotsopoulos>Samantha Makosz>Anupreet Tumber,>Wilfrid Laurier University>Wilfrid Laurier University>Wilfrid Laurier University>Wilfrid Laurier University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0132/index.html
2011,Do children and adults learn forward and inverse conditional probabilities together?,"Learning p(A|B) often provides information about p(B|A). Do learners attend to this information? In Experiment 1, preschool-aged children learned to predict the sound of an alien from its color. The predictability of color from sound did not have a large effect on learning rate. During testing children seemed to use the learned probabilities, p(sound|color) to make judgments of the inverses, p(color|sound) rather than the actual encountered frequency distribution. In Experiment 2 adults showed a similar pattern. Adults used the probabilities they were trained on, either p(sound|color) or p(color|sound), to make judgments of the inverses. These results support previous demonstration of an inverse fallacy and suggest that both young children and adults show very task-specific learning.",>Charles Kalish,>University of Wisconsin-Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0133/index.html
2011,The Influence of Co-occurrence Probability on Knowledge Generalization in Preschool-Age Children,"Prior research had documented that semantically-similar labels that co-occur in child-directed speech promote generalization in young children. The present study examined whether co-occurrence probability  in the absence of semantic similarity  can influence childrens inferences. Four- and five-year-old children were exposed to an auditory speech stream consisting of trisyllabic nonsense words (e.g. golabu) that were concatenated into a continuous speech stream. After listening to the stream, children were given a label extension task where the first two syllables of a nonsense word were assigned to a novel target object (e.g. gola); children were asked to choose which of the three test items should be referred to by the remaining syllable of this nonsense word (e.g., bu; Experimental) or by a syllable from a different nonsense word (e.g., ti; Control). Childrens generalization performance in this task was similar to results of previous research that used natural rather than artificial language.",>Bryan Matlen>Anna Fisher>Karrie Godwin,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0134/index.html

2011,Neural Basis of Event Words,"On some accounts, word-meanings are organized in the human-brain according to their sensory-motor attributes. We tested an alternative hypothesis: word-meanings are neuroanatomically dissociable along abstract conceptual dimensions (entities vs. events). We measured brain activity in the left middle temporal gyrus (lMTG), a brain region that has previously been shown to respond more to verbs than nouns during semantic tasks. While undergoing fMRI, participants judged the semantic relatedness of six types of word-pairs: motion verbs (to roll), emission verbs (to sparkle) and perception verbs (to observe), animal nouns, fruit/vegetable nouns, and event nouns (the wedding). Replicating previous results, lMTG BOLD signal was higher for verbs than for object nouns. BOLD was also higher for event nouns than object nouns. We hypothesize that the lMTG responds to the conceptual category of events, rather than the grammatical category of verbs. These data suggest that lexical-semantic information is organized according to abstract conceptual dimensions.",>Swetha Dravida>Marina Bedny>Rebecca Saxe,>MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences>MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences>MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0136/index.html
2011,"Space, Time and Causality: Some Neural Observations","Knowledge of events involves understanding the way that objects occupy space, exist in time, and relate to each other. I will consider behavioral, fMRI and lesion studies that explore how space, time and causality are structured and interact in our brains. Tentatively, I propose the following. 1) The perception and conception of space has a parallel organizational structure. Evidence for this claim comes from the finding that the distinction between path and manner of motion as expressed linguistically is also processed with an analogous dorsal ventral neural organization. 2) Perception of space and time can be tightly linked. Behavioral data show that we are spatial-temporal synaesthetes. The perception of spatial distance and the perception of temporal duration interact highly. 3) The right hemisphere is biased to process space and the left to process time despite bilateral overlap in neural underpinnings of these processes. This assertion is based on data from size discrimination and temporal order judgment tasks, which we regard as markers of space and time granularity. The hypothesis also bears out in data examining the contributions of space and time to perceptual causality. 4) Time, compared to space, has a privileged relationship to causality. In making judgments about perceptual causality, people are more sensitive to temporal offsets than to spatial deviations. When listening to short narratives with sequential events, the neural circuits engaged by causality subsumes neural circuits engaged by time much more so than the neural circuits engaged by space. Investigating interactions between space, time, and causality can reveal the rich texture of events.",>Anjan Chatterjee,">University of Pennsylvania

Behavioral experiments have recently shown that planning in the ToL is substantially influenced by structural task parameters. This work presents an ACT-R model of the ToL that explains structural influences by using different strategies, whereby, strategy selection depends on visually observable characteristics. Model evaluation was based on a problem selection that accounted for systematic variations of task demands. Based on comparisons with empirically observed planning latencies from previously published data, we argue that task-specific structural characteristics are necessary to explain human planning strategies.",>Rebecca Albrecht>Sven Brüssow>Christoph Kaller>Marco Ragni,">Center of Cognitive Science University Freiburg>Center of Cognitive Science University Freiburg>Department of Neurology

What decision strategies will outcompete others in a population of searchers? We extend previous approaches using computer simulations to study mate search strategies by allowing direct competition between multiple strategies, evaluating success on multiple criteria. In a mixed social environment of searchers of different types, simple strategies can exploit more demanding strategies in unexpected ways.

We use a computational model of word learning to further shed light on these factors. In particular, we show that variations in the attentional abilities of the computational learner can be used to model various identified differences in LTs compared to normally-developing children: delayed and slower vocabulary growth, greater difficulty in novel word learning, and decreased semantic connectedness among learned words.",>Aida Nematzadeh>Afsaneh Fazly>Suzanne Stevenson,>University of Toronto>University of Toronto>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0141/index.html
2011,Asymmetry and Similarity Phenomena in Backwards Masking Experiments Suggest Internal Reconstruction.,"How the brain processes pattern mixtures is not well understood. The prevailing views are 1) that difficult tasks are processed in serial, and easy tasks in parallel 2) in fast image presentations with effective masking leaves little time for re-entrant neural dynamics other than feed-forward, excluding the possibility of top-down processing. We hypothesize that to process pattern mixtures, the brain creates an internal copy which we call reconstruction. This reconstruction process displays difficulty with similarity and asymmetry effects. Our model predicts that Similarity and asymmetry effects should also occur with fast backwards masking 1) indicating neither a strictly parallel nor serial structure 2) suggests that top-down reconstruction occurs even with fast masks because the brain is processing the target and mask as a mixture.",>Tsvi Achler>Luis Bettencourt>Garrett Kenyon,>Los Alamos National Labs>Los Alamos National Labs>Los Alamos National Labs,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0142/index.html

The paper describes a two-part experiment where speakers were given the name of a famous person and had to create a description that would enable a hearer to identify the person, and hearers used the created descriptions to guess the name of the described person. The experiment compares how confident hearers are that they have identified the referent and how well speakers can estimate this confidence. The results of the experiment suggest that speakers do not overestimate hearers' confidence as the psycholinguistic literature had led us to expect.",>Roman Kutlak>Kees van Deemter>Chris Mellish,>University of Aberdeen>University of Aberdeen>University of Aberdeen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0143/index.html

At the beginning of each trial, a reward (1 euro or 5 cents) was presented, either subliminally or supraliminally. Participants could earn the reward if they found the correct response on the updating task. Results showed better performance when a high (conscious or unconscious) reward was at sake compared to a low reward.

2011,The role of reliability in causal belief updating,"There is not yet a clear agreement about the functional differences between the processing of mechanism versus covariation information in causal judgments. It has been shown recently that causal belief updating does not depend on the informations origin but on the reliability of new information fed to the updating process (Perales, Catena, Maldonado, & Candido, 2007; Perales, Shanks, & Lagnado, 2010). However, there are many aspects that make new information reliable. This study orthogonally manipulates two factors contributing to reliability, information source and sample size, to determine how they interact with the origin of information when updating causal beliefs that involve a high level of contingency. Results suggest that sample size is weighted more heavily when causal beliefs are originally expressed with covariation information. Thus, reliability is better understood as encompassing multiple factors that influence belief updating differently",>William Jimenez-Leal>Christian Gaviria>Miguel Uribe,>Universidad de los Andes>Universidad de los Andes>Universidad de la Sabana,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0145/index.html

Participants act as external judges and evaluate the performance of teams of differently skilled players who compete in a darts game. The results show that both performance and skill influence responsibility attributions. Poor performance elicits high blame and low credit ratings and vice versa for good performance. Responsibility attributions to one player did not vary as a function of the other players performance. The influence of skill on responsibility attributions was asymmetric. While skilled players were blamed more for losses than unskilled players, credit ratings did not vary significantly as a function of skill. This result is in line with peoples strong tendency to spontaneously consider upwards counterfactual alternatives for losses over downwards counterfactuals for wins.",>Tobias Gerstenberg>Anastasia Ejova>David Lagnado,>University College London>University of Adelaide>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0146/index.html
2011,A Causal Spectrum: A Causal Model based on Multi-faceted Notion of Causality,"Cartwright in her (2004) paper takes a pluralistic approach to causation. Inspired by Pearls (2000) multi-faceted notion of causation and Cartwrights approach, I suggest a Causal Spectrum, a model in which all the causal models are arranged according to an agents amount and more importantly type of knowledge about a causal event. The more efficiently we use our knowledge of causal situations the more we are able to choose the right analysis to reason causally. I have arranged the existing models of causality along this spectrum. The spectrum shape, going from left to right, starts as a line, and divides into a number of branches. The initial line corresponds to the basic positions, Humean regularity, intervention or manipulation approaches. The branches are probabilistic models of causality, then counterfactual models and the logical methodology.

2011,"Creativity, expertise and the questions people ask in engineering design","Finding a creative solution to a design problem (e.g. designing a device for taking water samples at different depths) often depends on finding a fruitful representation of the problem space. For instance, a problem space in which the device is assumed to be motor-driven might be less fruitful than one in which the mechanism for motion is not specified or could be one of several possibilities. Designersʼ representations of problem spaces evolve as they work on individual problems. The questions they ask themselves (and sometimes each other) may play a key role in the process. Do expert and novice designers ask similar questions? Do more creative and less creative designers ask similar questions? How do expertise and creativity interact?

Recent studies on embodied and situated cognition suggest that complex behavior may be explained by simple sensory-motor coordination.This paper hypothesizes that creative thought depends on the interaction between the thinker's body and the physical environment in the problem situation. To examine this hypothesis, three psychological experiments were conducted. The results of experiments indicate that the size of the hands of the participants that solved the problem differed with the given object size.

2011,Grounding lexical choice in Bayesian inference,"This paper proposes a rational analysis of referential inference. Referential inference is involved whenever a speaker has to provide an utterance that will effect some action on the part of their listenera situation that occurs constantly in everyday language use. Our rational analysis of referring makes certain assumptions about the goal, environment, and computational constraints involved in referring. A simple Bayesian model is defined based on this rational analysis and is then fit to data from two experiments of Brennan & Clarks (1996) referential communication study. This model is one of the first attempts at using a Bayesian framework to model data from a referential communication task. While the model is able to make interesting predictions about the qualitative trends in the data, a more sophisticated model is needed to make more accurate quantitative predictions.

Since Bauer first presented the conception of perceived risk in the decision making of consumer behavior, the role of perceived risk in product choice has attracted much attention and decisions such as choosing unknown objects have been known to be risky. Here in this study, we focused on how such risky decisions in product choices differ according to risk attitude and the faced situation under a virtual market situation. As a result, risk-takers consistently made risky choices while situation dependent behavior of risk-avoiders was observed. That is, the more unknown objects were presented, the less risky choices risk-avoiders selected. This result suggests that, in order to increase sales of a new product (unknown object), it is effective to lay it out with well known objects, not with other new products.",>Ikuya Nomura>Yasushi Onuki>Kazuyuki Samejima>Yuichi Washida>Kazuhiro Ueda>Hiroyuki Okada>Takashi Omori,">The University of Tokyo>Tamagawa University>Tamagawa University>Hakuhodo Inc.>The University of Tokyo

A simple number matching task elicited fewer strokes, shorter response times, and velocity patterns resembling simple ballistic reaching movements. A personality rating task tended to elicit multiple strokes and longer RTs, which caused a typical inverted-U RT effect.

Some criticism on this program relay over the absence of theoretical and mechanistic models of heuristics. Cognitive errors in medical diagnosis are widely described as biases provoked by the use of heuristics in realistic clinical frameworks. Here we show that associative memory models instructed to perform medical diagnosis by capturing frequencies from the environment display the same biases observed in clinical practice. This suggests that the mechanism underlying heuristics and biases could be of associative nature. In addition, the mathematics of the model links its performance with Bayesian inference. We find valuable to consider the possibility that the associative nature of human memory could be acting as a unifying mechanism explaining both heuristics and biases and Bayesian inference.",>Andrés Pomi,">Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0155/index.html
2011,"Meaning, Action, and History: Spatial Language as a Dynamic System","Empirical studies suggest that (a) language is grounded in action and (b) that the immediate past history of use influences how humans produce and comprehend spatial prepositions. We put these assumptions to the test by computationally modelling data from a spatial language task. The task required participants to place functionally related/unrelated objects on a screen w.r.t to a spatial preposition. Across participants, the amount of experience with placing objects was varied. The employed model was a variant of the dynamic field theory model that has successfully been applied to the A-not-B error task (Thelen et al., 2001). Since previous actions are an integral part of the representations in the original model, applying it to the spatial language data allowed testing the mechanisms underlying the (change of the) meaning of spatial prepositions. Yielding a tight fit, simulations support the idea that the meaning of spatial prepositions is dynamically grounded in actions.",>Holger Schultheis>Kenny Coventry,>University of Bremen>Northumbria University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0156/index.html

Students achievement goals (mastery-approach, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance) were measured right before each of the 3 exams administered during the course. Each exam included items that assessed factual, conceptual, and application-based knowledge. Exam 1 performance on factual and conceptual items was (marginally) positively predicted by performance-approach goals but not mastery-approach goals. However, by Exam 3 mastery-approach goals positively predicted performance whereas performance-approach goals did not. Furthermore, changes in these goals from Exam 1 to Exam 3 predicted performance. Becoming more mastery-oriented over time predicted higher Exam 3 scores, while becoming more performance-approach-oriented predicted lower scores. This difference was particularly strong for application questions, which required a deeper understanding of the material.

Accuracy was higher among sentences expressing all emotions except anger in the semantic condition. Overall, the lowest categorization accuracy was found for sentences expressing fear in the prosodic condition. Although all participants in the current study had normative scores on the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale, those with relatively high scores displayed lower categorization accuracy for semantic sentences expressing happiness, anger and fear than lower-scoring participants.

Results indicated that the participant organized and controlled the writing process by using the following four domains of metacognitive strategies: (a) planning discourse/thinking, (b) evaluating discourse/thinking, (c) recognizing problems with discourse/thinking, and (d) repairing discourse/thinking. The participant engaged in knowledge-telling behavior and focused on surface level text structure to produce a final product at a low abstractive level.

2011,The moderating effect of problem difficulty on the sleep role on insight problem problem,"Current findings show that sleep facilitates problem solving through restructuring of the problem representation. Theories on insight suggest that such representational change occurs only if an individual has reached an impasse. Accordingly, the effects of sleep should be found only on difficult insight problems that can induce an impasse. To test this prediction, participants attempted easy and difficult verbal insight problems. After a period of 12 or 24 hours including sleep, or 12 hours awake, participants returned to solve problems that were previously-unsolved as well as novel problems. The sleep group solved more previously-unsolved difficult problems than the awake group. No sleep-induced improvement was found for easy and novel problems. This suggests that the effects of sleep on insight are not absolute, but depend on whether the insight problem induces an impasse and requires representational restructuring.",>Ut Na Sio>Padraic Monaghan>Tom Ormerod,">Psychology of Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom>Psychology of Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom>Psychology of Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0162/index.html

In cases where /s/ occurs on both sides of a word boundary (e.g., gas station) segmentation might be difficult because the two s-sounds blend together into one long s-sound. We report a series of experiments that examined how listeners segment such sequences, focusing on the contribution of lexical knowledge and /s/ duration. The stimuli were two-word phrases made up of all possible combinations of the lexical status of both words (e.g., gas-station, nas-station, gas-stagon, nas-stagon). The duration of the stimuli and the middle /s/ were also manipulated. The results show that lexicality trades off with relative duration in determining how many s-sounds listeners hear and to which of the two words, or both, the s-sound is perceived as belonging.",>Colin Widmer>Dahee Kim>Christine Szostak>Mark Pitt,">Department of Psychology

2011,The Category-Order Effect in Supraspan Recall,"The category-order effect is observed when stimuli from a small, homogenous category are presented before a large, heterogeneous category (Greene & Lasek, 1994). Schoenherr and Thomson (2008) determined that the category-order effect was a product of the phonotactic properties of the category, facilitating recall in situations that were not consistent with Greene and Laseks account. In the present study, we examine recall once word length and word frequency effects were controlled in exemplar (e.g., bird, hawk) or feature (e.g., claw, wing) lists. We then compared recall performance when words either preceded or followed single-digit number stimuli. To control for the effect of presentation format, number stimuli were presented as single-digits or words. Although our findings support a category-order effect, they challenge the definition offered by early research. Specifically, orthographic properties and word frequency influenced the category-order effect, suggesting that it is not simply a result of category size and homogeneity.",>Lisa Boucher>Jordan Schoenherr>Robert Thosmon>Guy Lacroix,>Carleton University>Carleton University>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0164/index.html
2011,"Dissociation of Thematic, Taxonomic, and Integrative Relations","Word pairs may be connected by several possible relations including integrative (denoting a subclass of the head noun; INSTRUCTION  BOOK, a type of book), thematic (related to a common event or theme; EDITOR  BOOK), and taxonomic (shared features and category membership; ARTICLE  BOOK). Prior studies have found greater lexical priming for thematic than taxonomic items, however that may have been partially attributable to greater association strengths for the thematic items. Using participant ratings and computational measures (LSA, Google), we assessed the similarity, co-occurrence, and familiarity of 180 non-associated items representing these three relational constructs and compared the magnitude of lexical priming across short (100 ms) and long (2000 ms) prime-target presentation delays (SOAs). Although priming effects did not reliably differ among the relations at either SOA, regression analyses revealed different factors influencing response times for the integrative targets than for the thematic and taxonomic relations.",>Lara L.

2011,The Social-Pragmatics of Category Learning,"Collaborators generally coordinate their activities through communication, during which they negotiate a shared lexicon for activity-related objects. This social-pragmatic activity both recruits and affects cognitive and social-cognitive processes ranging from selective attention to perspective taking. We ask whether negotiating reference also facilitates category learning or might private verbalization yield comparable facilitation? Participants in three referential conditions learned to classify imaginary creatures according to combinations of functional features -- nutritive and destructive -- that implicitly defined four categories. Remote partners communicated in the Dialogue condition. In the Monologue condition, participants recorded audio descriptions for their own later use. Controls worked silently. Dialogue yielded better category learning, with wider selective attention. Monologue offered no benefits over working silently. We conclude that negotiating reference compels collaborators to find communicable structure in their shared activity; this shareability constraint accelerates category learning and likely provides much of the benefit recently ascribed to learning labeled categories.",>John Voiklis>James Corter,">Stevens Institute of Technology>Teachers College, Columbia University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0166/index.html
2011,Active Cross-situational Learning,"Human adults can acquire word-referent pairs from a short series of individually ambiguous situations containing multiple words and referents (Yu & Smith, 2007). Cross-situational statistical learning is sufficient for learners to passively acquire word-object pairs, as long as words co-occur with their correct referent multiple times in different contexts. However, learners in the real world are not completely passive, but can affect how their environment is structured to some extent. We compare performance in the original cross-situational word learning task to performance in an equivalent active learning task in which participants choose the objects they would like to hear named on each successive trial. Many learners perform much better in the active task, although some learners did well in both tasks. We investigate the various strategies utilized by active learners and show how a model with uncertainty can produce these strategies.",>George Kachergis>Chen Yu>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0167/index.html
2011,Tort Reform: Negligence Explains Attributions of Intentionality for Negative Side Effects,"It seems intuitive to attribute intentionality to goal-directed actions. Sometimes, though, goal-directed actions yield side effects that actors could foresee but did not necessarily intend. Previous research suggests that people make opposing attributions to negative and positive side effects: they attribute intentionality to negative side effects but not to positive side effects. Those researchers argue that moral disapproval colors intentionality judgments for negative side effects. We do not dismiss this interpretation, rather we show that moral judgment influences intuitions about a specific type of intentionality: negligence. Participants learned about a business decision that yields explicitly intended profits and one of two foreseeable side effects (harmful or helpful) on the environment. We replicated prior findings when controls rated agreement with an attribution of intentionality for the side effect. Participants overwhelmingly attributed side effects to negligence when choosing between intentional, negligent, or unintentional attributions. These effects were greater for negative side effects.",>John Voiklis>Jeffrey Nickerson,>Stevens Institute of Technology>Stevens Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0168/index.html
2011,Looking at the Social Dynamics of Viewpoint,"Allocentric perspectives are more common when describing spatial scenes when affordances and language facilitate taking such a point of view (Greenwood et al., 2010). People tend to feel close to friends and distant from strangers in both a metaphoric and physical sense (Matthews & Matlock, 2010). This work examines the relationship between perspective taking and social distance in a simulated school setting. Participants imagined attending a meeting with two other students: Mary and John. Johns friendship with the participant was varied across conditions. Participants viewed a scene of a table and chairs where each members location was labeled, then described where Mary was sitting. Egocentric frames of reference were more common when participants were familiar/friends with John and less common when participants and John were unfamiliar with one another. Many factors influence an individuals perspective, and these results suggest that information regarding social relationships can also influence perspective-taking.",>Michelle D. Greenwood>Justin L.

2011,Controlling Stable and Unstable Dynamic Decision Making Environments,"In the present study we ask: Are people sensitive to the stability of a dynamic environment under short exposure to it? To examine this we investigate peoples cue manipulation and strategy application when instructed to learn to control an outcome in a dynamic system by intervening on three cues. The system was designed in such a ways that in the Stable condition participants controlled an outcome that fluctuated steadily overall 40 trials, and in the Unstable condition the outcome fluctuated erratically over 40 trials. In the present study we show that people tended to intervene more frequently on all three cues when the system was Unstable compared to the when the system was Stable. Overall, the evidence from this study supports the general prediction made from the Monitoring and Control framework (Osman, 2010a, 2010b).",>Magda Osman>Maarten Speekenbrink,">Centre for Experimental and Biological Psychology, Queen Mary University of London,

2011,Spatial biases in understanding descriptions of static scenes: The role of reading and writing direction,"Habitual reading and writing direction (RWD) is known to induce spatial biases in meaning construction from descriptions of actions. We extended prior studies to descriptions of static scenes and assessed the flexibility of these spatial habits in bicultural minds. Sentences like ""the table is between the lamp and the TV were auditorily presented, and the task was to draw the described situation. A Spanish group preferred to deploy the objects from left to right, whereas a Moroccan group preferred right to left. A third group of highly Spanish-acculturated Arabs showed a pattern very similar to Spanish, but milder. Despite these differences, the three groups equally preferred those options generating a lower memory load. We conclude that RWD is able to bias the understanding of static descriptions; that these spatial habits are flexible; and that memory management follows universal principles.",>Antonio Román>Abderrahman El Fathi>Julio Santiago,">Dept. of Experimental Psychology, University of Granada, Spain>Dept. of Hispanic Philology, Université Abdelmalek Esaadi, Morocco>Dept. of Experimental Psychology, University of Granada, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0171/index.html
2011,Retrieval Dynamics of In-the-Moment and Long-Term Statistical Word Learning,"Theories of word learning have proposed several tools that children and adults use to reduce the difficulty of the word learning problem. However, we propose that reducing difficulty may be detrimentaldifficulty may promote long-term word learning. In this study, we tested predictions of the retrieval effort hypothesis in a cross-situational word learning paradigm. Learners were presented with objects and labels in three conditions of learning (easy, medium, and difficult) and tested either immediately or one week later. Results revealed a counterintuitive pattern of performanceinitially, participants in the easy condition had the highest performance. However, after a one week delay, participants in the medium condition had the highest performance. Participants self-report of retrieval difficulty during learning is used to account for differences in performance over time. This work is discussed in terms of the implications for several fields of cognitive science: statistical learning, human memory, and language and cognitive development.",>Haley A. Vlach>Catherine M.

2011,The effect of time pressure and the spatial integration of the stimulus dimensions on overall similarity categorization.,"The effect of time pressure and the spatial integration of the stimulus dimensions on overall similarity sorting is investigated. A 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial design was employed with the factors being the level of time pressure (high/low) and the spatial integration of the stimulus dimensions (high/low). The results showed, consistent with Milton and Wills (2004), that spatially separable stimuli resulted in a greater level of overall similarity sorting than more spatially integrated dimensions. Furthermore, participants under low time pressure produced a greater level of overall similarity sorting than those under high time pressure, consistent with Milton, Longmore and Wills (2008). Critically, there was also a significant interaction between time pressure and the level of spatial integration, with the integration effect being greater under low time pressure than under high time pressure. These findings support the idea that overall similarity sorting can be the result of an effortful, deliberative process.",>Fraser Milton>Lotta Viika>Holly Henderson>Andy Wills,>University of Exeter>University of Exeter>University of Exeter>University of Exeter,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0173/index.html
2011,Cross-Language Priming in Chinese-English Bilinguals with Different Second Language Proficiency Levels,"In this paper we describe an experimental study of cross-language priming effects between Chinese and English. The priming effects for both translation equivalents and semantically related word pairs were examined from a developmental aspect, in particular under three different situations according to bilinguals second language (English) proficiency level measured by CPVT and language history questionnaire, and learning experience determined by whether they have lived in a foreign country. The results match up with previous findings, in terms of the larger effects of priming from L1 to L2 than from L2 to L1 (priming asymmetry) and the stronger facilitation for translation priming than semantic priming. More importantly, our study demonstrates how such asymmetries in priming change as the bilinguals L2 learning history changes. These findings are discussed in light of current models of bilingual lexical memory.",>Xiaowei Zhao>Ping Li>Youyi Liu>Xiaoping Fang>Hua Shu,">Department of Psychology, Emmanuel College,

In two experiments, we implement two educational interventions, prototyping and critical feedback, to help reduce design fixation, which is defined as adherence to one's own design. We found that constant prototyping across the design process reduced fixation in the final product. Surprisingly, we also found that not receiving feedback reduced fixation in the final product.

2011,Are Category Labels Features or Naïve Assumption?,"Category labels are known to guide inductive generalizations by modifying the representation of stimuli (i.e., the labeling effect); yet, the mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. One view suggests that shared category labels increase overall similarity between items as shared physical features do. The other view suggests that category labels are qualitatively different from category features, as category labels help integrate prior knowledge. The present study examined these two competing views with respect to two types of background knowledge  domains of categories (living things vs. man-made objects) and the amount of knowledge (the number of listed exemplars). The results from two experiments suggest that category labels are likely to be used as features for man-made objects, while category labels help create a naïve assumption for living things, implicating that similarity-based statistical processes and knowledge-based structured processes are employed interactively to cope with different domains of knowledge.",>Na-Yung Yu>Takashi Yamauchi,>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0176/index.html
2011,Adaptive Magnitude and Valence Biases in a Dynamic Memory Task,"Given that human memory is fallible, it is likely adaptive for people to preferentially encode, retain, and retrieve important items better than insignificant ones. Using a dynamic decision-making paradigm with a response deadline, we find that humans demonstrate a bias to better remember 1) items with positive rather than negative value, and 2) items with high-magnitude values. Performance was greater when participants were shown all item-value pairs simultaneously, and were thus able to selectively attend to high-magnitude values. The same magnitude bias is observed for sequentially studied positive items, but not for negative items. Decision trajectories show participants sometimes change their minds during the course of a trial, choosing an item after first moving toward the other. Changes of heart occurred more often for trials with negative items. These findings suggest that memory is sensitive to value, and that real-time game paradigms can be used to reveal dynamic memory processes.",>George Kachergis>Gabriel Recchia>Richard Shiffrin,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0177/index.html
2011,Strategy Changes as a Function of Task Complexity in Causal Structure Learning,"The authors previously demonstrated that people emphasized covariation rather than temporal order as a clue to inferring causal structure, whereas Lagnado and Sloman (2006) showed the opposite results that temporal order overrode covariation. The authors proposed the interpretation that these conflicting findings resulted from task complexity, since covariation becomes more complicated as the number of variables increases, and investigated the relationship between the number of variables which constituted causal structures and the use of two types of cues (i.e., covariation and temporal order). The experimental results revealed the increasing use of temporal order as a function of the number of variables. Although several models of causal structure learning use either of two types of cues, the present study indicates the necessity to integrate covariational information and temporal order information.",>Motoyuki Saito>Tsuneo Shimazaki,>Kwansei Gakuin University>Kwansei Gakuin University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0178/index.html
2011,Ad Hoc Cognition,"If concepts, categories, and word meanings are stable, how can people use them so flexibly? Here we explore a possible answer: maybe this stability is an illusion. Perhaps all concepts, categories, and word meanings (CC&Ms;) are constructed ad hoc, each time we use them. On this proposal, all words are infinitely polysemous, all communication is good enough, and no idea is ever the same twice. The details of peoples ad hoc CC&Ms; are determined by the way retrieval cues interact with the physical, social, and linguistic context. We argue that even the most stable-seeming CC&Ms; are instantiated via the same processes as those that are more obviously ad hoc, and vary (a) from one microsecond to the next within a given instantiation, (b) from one instantiation to the next within an individual, and (c) from person to person and group to group as a function of peoples experiential history.",>Daniel Casasanto>Gary Lupyan,">MPI for Psycholinguistics;

2011,Toward a Formal Model of the Shifting Relationship between Concepts and Contexts in Associative Thought,"According to contextual focus, a dual processing theory, we shift between an analytic mode to apply conventional perspectives to a situation, and an associative mode to see things anew (Gabora, 2003). We present a model of this using the State-COntext-Property (SCOP) theory of concepts. A concept is modeled as existing in a state of potentiality until it interacts with a context, which causes it to collapse to an exemplar state. By defining measures of exemplar robustness and context relevance, and introducing an exemplar typicality threshold, we show the conditions under which varying this threshold enables collapse to exemplars of the concept that are atypical but appropriate to the context. Support for the model was obtained using data from an experiment in which participants were asked to rate the typicality of exemplars of a concept for different contexts. The research constitutes an important step toward a formal model of contextual focus.",>Tomas Veloz>Liane Gabora,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0180/index.html
2011,Motion influences childrens attention to object properties during noun learning,"This research demonstrates that the motions of objects influence childrens attention to the parts of objects when learning nouns. Three- to five-year-old children viewed animated events involving bug-like creatures, each accompanied by one of two novel nouns. Nouns were differentiated by the creatures heads and legs. In addition, for some participants, the motions of the heads and legs distinguished nouns while paths of creatures varied randomly. For other participants, paths distinguished nouns while motions of the heads and legs varied randomly. We tested children by presenting events that varied on the relevant object properties and motions and asking if these events were still good examples of the nouns heard earlier. Participants were more likely to discover the association of nouns with creatures heads and legs when they moved in consistent manners than when moved in randomly-varying ways. These results suggest that motions influence childrens noun learning preferences.",>Simone Chin>Alan Kersten>Jodi-Ann Thomas,>Florida Atlantic University>Florida Atlantic University>University of Tulsa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0181/index.html

Here, we extend this work by examining how statistical word learning may be constrained or facilitated by memory development. Two groups of infants, 16- and 20-month-olds, were presented with a cross-situational word learning task. Half of the object-label pairings occurred in immediate succession and the other half of pairings were separated in time. We observed developmental differences in the ability to track, aggregate, and infer associations across time: 16-month-olds were able to learn pairings presented in immediate succession whereas 20-month-olds were able learn pairings both in immediate succession and across time. Results are discussed in terms of implications for theories of statistical learning, memory, and language and cognitive development.",>Haley A. Vlach>Scott P.

2011,"Now You See It, Now You Dont: how social cues and questions misdirect our attention","Magic tricks offer powerful tools to manipulate people's attention and conscious experience. Using real-world eyetracking we can investigate how different misdirection cues drive people's eye movements. Moreover, by measuring people's susceptibility to the trick, we can evaluate how these cues influence people's conscious experience. We used a magic trick to explore the way in which spoken questions and gaze cues influence eye movements and awareness. The trick involved a fully visible colour change as a probe of whether participants displayed change blindness due to social misdirection. Our results show that the question misdirected attention towards the magician's face and prevented people from perceiving the colour change. In this paper we discuss how linguistic misdirection is modulated by gaze cues.

2011,Fractal Structure in Voluntary Eye Movements,"Fractal scaling relations are found in repeated measurements of voluntary human behavior (e.g., time estimation, visual search, word naming). These fractal scaling relations suggest that the variation in the observed behavior is scale-free with small-scale and large-scale variations sharing the same structure. Researchers have proposed a conceptual control parameter that may account for reliable changes in fractal dimension observed across behaviors and tasks (e.g., Van Orden, 2010; Kloos & Van Orden, 2010). This control parameter is a ratio between the uncontrolled and controlled degrees-of-freedom (DoF) associated with a particular experimental procedure. Two voluntary eye movement experiments tested whether this parameter accounts for differences in observed fractal dimension. Collectively, these results support the conceptual utility of the proposed control parameter. Conditions in which uncontrolled DoF exceeded controlled DoF yielded fractal dimension estimates more toward white noise, whereas conditions in which controlled DoF exceed uncontrolled DoF yielded estimates more toward brown noise.",>Charles Coey>Sebastian Wallot>Michael Richardson>Guy van Orden,">Center for Cognition, Action, & Perception, University of Cincinnati>Center for Cognition, Action, & Perception, University of Cincinnati>Center for Cognition, Action, & Perception, University of Cincinnati>Center for Cognition, Action, & Perception, University of Cincinnati",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0184/index.html
2011,"Don't Look Now: The relationship between mutual gaze, task performance and staring in Second Life","Mutual gaze is important to social interaction, and can also facilitate task performance. Previous work has assumed that staring at someone maximises mutual gaze. Eye-tracking is used to explore this claim, along with the relationship between mutual gaze and task performance. Two participants  Instruction Giver (IG) and Instruction Follower (IF)  communicated via avatars in Second Life to solve simple arithmetic tasks. There were two conditions: staring (the IG's avatar stared continuously at the IF); and not-staring, (IG's avatar looked at IF and task-relevant objects). Instead of maximising mutual gaze, constant staring actually showed evidence of decreasing eye contact within the dyad. Mutual gaze was positively correlated with task performance scores, but only in the not-staring condition. When not engaged in mutual gaze, the IF looked more at task-related objects in the not-staring condition than in the staring condition.

The present study introduces a new method of measuring turn-boundary projection that enables researchers to achieve more valid, flexible, and temporally informative data on online turn projection: tracking an observers gaze from the current speaker to the next speaker. In this preliminary investigation, participants consistently looked at the current speaker during their turn. Additionally, they looked to the next speaker before her turn began, and sometimes even before the current speaker finished speaking. This suggests that observer gaze is closely aligned with perceptual processes of turn-boundary projection, and thus may equip the field with the tools to explore how we manage to take turns.",>Marisa Tice>Tania Henetz,>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0186/index.html

Analysis of credibility judgment ratings revealed that older adults were less influenced by argument strength in content messages and contextual Website features than younger adults. Verbal protocol analysis revealed that older adults tended to accept the facts they read on the Web page instead of further deliberating on their credibility. They also tended to pay less attention to contextual Website features relevant to the credibility of the information. We also found that older adults lower sensitivity to credibility cues on a Web page could at least be partially explained by their declined cognitive ability and lack of Internet experience. On the other hand, health-related domain knowledge was found to be useful in helping older adults to make better credibility judgments.",>Q.

2011,The Effect of Repeated Cue Exposure on Post-Completion Errors,"Slip errors in routine procedures are difficult to eliminate: training or increasing motivation are ineffective. Recently, several studies have used visual cues to reduce postcompletion errors, which occur when the last step in a task is forgotten after the main goal has been completed. Cues are effective in reducing PCEs. However, concerns have been raised over whether repeated exposure to cues may lead people to rely on them, and therefore become more prone to errors should the cue inadvertently be unavailable. We report on an experiment that tests the effect of repeated cues on the PCE rate. Participants were repeatedly exposed to an aggressive visual cue just before the PC step, and this cue was withdrawn on a number of target trials. Our results show that error rates on these target trials are similar to those of non-cued control participants, suggesting that participants do not become over-reliant on the cue.",>Maartje Ament>Anita Lai>Anna Cox,>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0188/index.html

In the current work, we examined whether adding auditory components to a computer-simulated environment might increase presence, thereby leading risk-taking behaviors to be more consistent with performance in an equivalent real environment. Our results suggests that adding auditory components to computer-simulated environments involving risk-taking behaviors may be useful.

In the present investigation, we report on results from a series of studies aimed at understanding the natural adoption of external, body based solutions while individuals attempt to recognize a disoriented object (e.g., head rotation). We demonstrate that one of the major factors contributing to the selection of an internal or external strategy is stimulus complexity. We also demonstrate large and reliable individual differences in strategy selection. Discussion focuses on the distribution of cognitive effort as a driving factor in the decision to adopt an internal or external strategy and the utility and inherent challenges in studying natural behavior as a means to shed light on this and related issues.",>Evan F.

2011,How Long Have I Got? Making Optimal Visit Durations in a Dual-Task Setting,"Can people multitask optimally? We use a dual-task paradigm in which participants had to enter digits while monitoring a randomly moving cursor. Participants earned points for entering digits correctly and were docked points if they let the cursor drift outside of a target area. The severity of the tracking penalty was varied between conditions. Participants therefore had to decide how long to leave the tracking task unattended. As expected, participants left the tracking task for longer when the penalty was less severe and also when the cursor moved less erratically. To test whether participants were adjusting their behavior in an optimal manner, observed behavior was compared to a prediction of the optimal visit duration for each condition. Overall, the degree of correspondence between the observed behavior and the predicted optimum was very good, suggesting that people can multitask in a near optimal fashion given explicit feedback on their performance",>George Farmer>Christian Janssen>Duncan Brumby,>University College London>University College London>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0191/index.html
2011,From Data Streams to Information Flow: Information Exchange in Child-Parent Interaction,"The goal of this paper is to enhance understanding of how bodily actions between two social partners are coordinated in interpersonal interactions in naturalistic contexts. We introduce information-theoretic measures as a new approach to capturing sensorimotor dynamics in child-parent social interaction. In particular, information flows were measured based on a set of variables extracted from multimodal fine-grained behavioral data in social interactions wherein a child and a parent played with novel toys. Our results showed that information-theoretic measures can indeed capture the inherent structure of perception and action dynamics and further information exchange patterns can be used to predict successful learning through child-parent interactions. Moreover, those information flows between sensorimotor variables reveal a set of underlying perceptual and motor patterns with cognitively plausible explanations. In summary, the present study represents the first steps to connect information-theoretic measures as a mathematically rigorous framework with embodied human communication and cognition.",>Heeyoul Choi>Chen Yu>Linda B.

2011,"A hybrid cognitive architecture based on the relationship between consciousness, memory and attention","To discern what characteristics a hybrid architecture should have to achieve the full range of human cognitive tasks, it might be helpful to explain the relationships between consciousness, memory and attention as accepted basic mechanisms. Consciousness would be a subjective awareness of momentary experience and also have the characteristics of an operating system performing control and consolidation information processing in comparison of memory and attention and three constructs could operate without each other. Mental architecture could be composed of hierarchical parallel processing, the recursive embedding of models, and the high-level model of the system itself. Modules as processors in the hybrid architecture both employ and are based on the relationship between consciousness, memory and attention in a basic common mechanism which should be well enough understood to be used in an explanation of mental architecture. Some theoretical and empirical evidence is instanced in the areas of metacognition and language processes.",>Eunsook Kim>Hyunjung Shin,>Pusan National University>Pusan National University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0194/index.html
2011,Semantic innovations in lexicon: cognitive pragmatic interface,The paper focuses on the interrelation of language use with linguistic structure and underlying conceptual structure. We proceed from the assumption that new meaning development involves both cognitive and pragmatic issues. We explore the cognitive basis of semantic innovations and the way the individual sense alterations that arise from deviations in the words use are developing into a new meaning of a lexeme. We concentrate on the analysis of the conceptual structure of a word as the major factor imposing constraints on deviation and meaning variation in a wide pragmatic context. The conceptual structure of a polysemantic word is represented as a macroframe consisting of several frames which form a radial structure. We develop the hypothesis about the pragmatics as the chief driving force in the processes of new meaning development and define the cognitive basis of two types of inference: pragmatic and semantic ones.,>Vera Zabotkina,>Russian State University for the Humanities,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0195/index.html
2011,The proper treatment of strcutured representations,"Accounts of human mental representation typically posit either the sole existence of structured (i.e., totally symbolic) representations, or the sole existence of holistic (i.e., totally sub-symbolic, or connectionist) representations. We argue that systems that implement structured representations are not necessarily as different form those that represent holistic representations as they appear at first blush. In fact, when a connectionist system is augmented with a single source of information, it becomes functionally symbolic. The resulting system addresses many of the problems associated with traditional symbolic approaches to cognition",>Katherine Livins>Leonidas Doumas,>University of Hawaii>University of Hawaii,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0196/index.html
2011,Adults and children fast-map novel connections between words.,"Adults and children rapidly capitalize upon relationships between agents and actions to generate expectancies for upcoming language, yet relatively little is understood how this knowledge is acquired and initially used. We explore this question in children (aged 3-10) and adults by measuring the degree to which sentences depicting recently learned connections between agent, actions and objects lead to anticipatory eye-movements to the objects. Participants first heard stories accompanied by pictures portraying two agents (e.g. dog, monkey), two actions (e.g. eating, riding) and four objects (e.g., candy, bus, apple, car). Next we measured eye-movements to the objects of these novel relationships while participants heard sentences like The monkey rides the bus. Combinatory information about the agent and action yielded anticipatory eye-movements to the target objects in both adults and children. Our findings suggest that adults and children can fast-map agent-action-object relationships and rapidly activate this knowledge in subsequent language processing.",>Arielle Borovsky>Kim Sweeney>Anne Fernald>Jeff Elman,">UCSD

2011,How Far Can Indirect Evidence Take Us? Anaphoric One Revisited,"A controversial claim in linguistics is that children face an induction problem, which is often used to motivate the need for Universal Grammar. English anaphoric one has been argued to present this kind of induction problem. While the original solution was that children have innate domain-specific knowledge about the structure of language, more recent studies have suggested alternative solutions involving domain-specific input restrictions coupled with domain-general learning abilities. We consider whether indirect evidence coming from a broader input set could obviate the need for such input restrictions. We present an online Bayesian learner that uses this broader input set, and discover it can indeed reproduce the correct learning behavior for anaphoric one, given child-directed speech. We discuss what is required for acquisition success, and how this impacts the larger debate about Universal Grammar.",>Lisa Pearl>Benjamin Mis,">Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine>Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0198/index.html

Using a statistical learning paradigm, participants learned transitional probabilities in two novel languages based on the International Morse Code. First, participants listened to a low-interference language to test word segmentation skill. Next, participants listened to a high-interference language, in which a colliding cue to word boundaries in the form of compressed pauses between words conflicted with the languages transitional probabilities. Results suggest that high proficiency in a second language can improve word learning in a novel language, but when interference during learning is high, language experience no longer confers a benefit and strong inhibitory control ability is necessary for learning to occur.",>James Bartolotti>Viorica Marian>Scott Schroeder>Anthony Shook,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0199/index.html
2011,The modulation of word type frequency on hemispheric lateralization of visual word recognition: Evidence from modeling Chinese character recognition,"In Chinese orthography, a dominant structure exists in which a semantic radical appears on the left and a phonetic radical on the right (SP characters); the minority, opposite arrangement also exists (PS characters). Recent studies showed that SP character processing is more left hemisphere (LH) lateralized than PS character processing; nevertheless, it remains unclear whether this is due to phonetic radical position or character type frequency. Through computational modeling with artificial lexicons, in which we implement a theory of hemispheric asymmetry in perception but do not assume phonological processing being LH lateralized, we show that the difference in character type frequency alone is sufficient to exhibit the effect that the dominant type has a stronger LH lateralization than the minority type. This effect is due to higher visual similarity among characters in the dominant type than the minority type, demonstrating the modulation of word type frequency on hemispheric lateralization.",>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao>Kit Cheung,>University of Hong Kong>University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0200/index.html
2011,A Liquid-State Model of Variability Effects in Learning Nonadjacent Dependencies,Language acquisition involves learning nonadjacent dependencies that can exist between words in a sentence. Several artificial grammar learning studies have shown that the human ability to detect dependencies between A and B in sequences AXB is influenced by the amount of variation in the X element. This paper presents a model of statistical learning that displays similar behavior on this task and generalizes in a human-like way. The model was also used to predict human behavior for increased distance and more variation in dependencies.

2011,Childrens Developing Understanding of Spatial Metaphors for Time,"Adult speakers of English use three different metaphor types to describe time, including moving-time (summer approaches), moving-ego (we approach summer), and sequence-as-relative-position-on-a-path (autumn follows summer). When do children grasp the meaning of these three metaphors for time and what cognitive and/or linguistic factors account for this understanding? To explore these questions, we interviewed 60 three- to six-year-old children as they participated in experimental tasks testing comprehension and production of time metaphors. We found that children could understand all three time metaphors by age five and verbally explain their meanings by age 6. Childrens comprehension also varied by metaphor type, with moving-time and moving-ego metaphors being learned earlier than sequence-as-relative-position-on-a-path metaphors. Moreover , childrens metaphor comprehension was strongly correlated with their time concept understanding. Overall, these results suggest that comprehension of time metaphors is an early emerging linguistic ability that is closely associated with childrens cognitive understanding of the time concept.",>Lauren Stites>Seyda Özçalışkan,>Georgia State University>Georgia State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0204/index.html

Results show that reaction times are faster at the beginning of sentences, but there is a robust linear decrease in RTs between positions. An ANOVA analysis determined that both the sentence type and the click position factors are significant, but there is no interaction effect. Nevertheless, all within-sentence-type comparisons were significant, while only the second position (before or after the verb) proved to be significant across sentence-type, suggesting that the parser is generally more strained before the appearance of the verb.",>David James Lobina>José Eugenio García-Albea,>Universitat Rovira i Virgili>Universitat Rovira i Virgili,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0205/index.html
2011,Text-Based Similarity Measures and Attitude Scale Development,"This research investigates the utility of text-based similarity measures in developing agree/disagree attitude scale questions in three ways. First, text mining of the narrative responses to an open-ended survey question about employee performance identified characteristic issues raised by highly engaged versus less engaged employees. These issues were used to develop new items that increased the reliability of the engagement scale. Second, latent semantic analysis can predict interrelatedness of attitude scale questions before scale administration. This information can inform decisions about which items to retain in the scale for field testing. Finally, inter-item semantic similarity can be a more appropriate, non-zero baseline for comparing correlations between items after scale administration. This allows more sensitive detection of item correlations which differ from text-based item similarity rather than from zero. These techniques have been used in development of attitude scales that measure employee engagement, work motivation, and adherence to merit system principles.",>John Ford,>U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0206/index.html

Participants judged sentences containing either generics or universally-quantified noun phrases as true or false. Under time pressure, participants treated universally-quantified noun phrases as if they were generics (e.g., responding true to ""All dogs have four legs,"" despite the existence of three-legged dogs). Participants also took longer to respond to sentences with universal quantifiers vs. generics. Data thus support a generics-as-default account.",>Meredith Meyer>Susan A. Gelman>Sarah M.

2011,Visual attention during spatial language comprehension: Reference alone isnt enough,"When people listen to sentences referring to objects and events in visual context, their visual attention to objects is closely time-locked to words in the unfolding utterance. How precisely people deploy attention during situated language understanding and in verifying (spatial) utterances is, however, unclear. A visual world hypothesis suggests that we look at what is mentioned (Tanenhaus et al., 1995) and anticipate likely referents based on linguistic cues (Altmann & Kamide, 1999). In spatial language research, in contrast, the Attention Vector Sum model (Regier & Carlson, 2001) predicts that in order to process a sentence such as The plant is above the clock, attention must shift from the clock to the plant. An eye-tracking study examined whether gaze pattern during comprehension of spatial descriptions support the visual world or the Attention Vector Sum account. Analyses of eye movements indicate that we need both accounts to accommodate the findings.",>Michele Burigo>Pia Knoeferle,">Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Center, University of Bielefeld>Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Center, University of Bielefeld",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0208/index.html
2011,Language comprehension is sensitive to changes in the reliability of lexical cues,"This paper tests the hypothesis that language comprehenders update their beliefs about the statistics of their language throughout the lifespan, and that this belief update allows comprehenders to combine probabilistic linguistic cues according to their reliability. We conduct a multi-day sentence comprehension study in which the reliability of a probabilistic cue to syntactic structure is manipulated between subjects. We find that as the reliability of one cue to syntactic structure decreases, comprehenders come to rely more on a second cue to syntactic structure. The results are consonant with rational models of cue integration in speech perception and in non-linguistic domains, thus suggesting a unifying computational principle governing the way humans use information across both perceptual and higher-level cognitive tasks.",>Alex Fine>T.

This developmental relationship may be mediated by rhythmic and prosodic structure: nursery rhymes have been described as perfect metrical poems. Here we investigate the hypothesis that nursery rhymes are rhythmically fractal. 27 nursery rhymes were spoken in a rhythmic or non-rhythmic ('reporting') style by 5 speakers. The speech envelope from each sample was passed through a low frequency (0-50 Hz) 8-channel amplitude modulation (AM) filterbank and channels were analysed for temporal patterning. For rhythmically-spoken rhymes, modulations in adjacent channels were strongly phase-locked so that one modulation cycle in a given channel typically encompassed two full cycles in the next channel. This phase-locked pattern extended across multiple modulation frequencies resulting in a hierarchically-nested, fractal structure. Non-rhythmic samples showed lower phase-locking. The fractal temporal structure of rhymes may serve to optimally entrain neural oscillatory activity for rhythm detection.",>Victoria Leong>Richard Turner>Michael Stone>Usha Goswami,">University of Cambridge, Department of Experimental Psychology, Centre for Neuroscience in Education>University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering, Computational & Biological Learning Lab>University of Cambridge, Department of Experimental Psychology, Auditory Perception Group>University of Cambridge, Department of Experimental Psychology, Centre for Neuroscience in Education",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0212/index.html

Qualia structure provides concrete constraints on interpretation, which are however too rigid to be cognitively plausible. We suggest generalized event knowledge as an alternative source of interpretation. Results from a first self-paced reading experiment, where we capitalize on the verb-final word order in German subordinate phrases to create rich expectations for events, are presented to support this hypothesis. Consequences of this hypothesis for the interpretation logical metonymies are (a), it is primarily driven by pragmatic and world knowledge; (b), it may use the same (rather than distinct) mechanisms and resources as general incremental sentence comprehension does.",>Alessandra Zarcone>Sebastian Pado,>Universitaet Stuttgart>Universitaet Heidelberg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0213/index.html

I present a Magnitude Estimation (ME) task in which participants judged similarity in meaning between pairs of verb occurrences consisting of a motion verb and a singular definite NP subject (e.g. ``The kid runs'' vs. ``The rabbit runs''). Differences between the subject nouns in these pairs are hypothesized to predict intuitions about verbal semantic similarity. I explore four measures of noun similarity, two based on noun animacy, as well as conceptual and distributional similarity measures. I find that all four factors are significant predictors of verbal semantic similarity judgments, but that the best model combines all four measures. This is taken as an indication that a proper use of converging sources of evidence enables a much finer-grained study of word meaning in context than is generally undertaken.",>Nicholas Gaylord,>University of Texas at Austin,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0214/index.html

Self-regulatory learning processes of self-efficacy, meta-cognition, and affect were examined as mediators, and cognitive ability and goal orientation were examined as moderating influences. Interruptions that occurred earlier in training and that were more complex resulted in worse performance and impaired self-regulatory states. Additionally, interactions emerged, such that individuals with less ability experienced lower levels of self-efficacy, felt more stressed and performed worse than those with higher ability, when interrupted early in training. All dimensions of goal orientation interacted with interruption timing on self-regulatory learning states. For example, individuals higher in performance avoid goal orientation, had higher self-efficacy, were more meta-cognitively active and performed better when interrupted in the first module of training, compared to those with lower levels of this orientation and not getting interrupted in the first module of training.",>Jessica Federman>Bradford Bell,>Cornell University>Cornell University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0216/index.html
2011,Spatial and Temporal Cues in Statistical Cross Situdational Learning,"Discovering the link between words and objects is necessary for language learning. Cross-situational learning is that in order to learn word to referent mappings, learners track statistical possibility across ambiguous trials between words and objects. Learners may also track additional cues to reference such as consistent spatial locations and temporal contiguity. We hypothesized that associative learning is best when both cues are available and poorest when neither cues are available. To examine the effects of these cues, subjects will be given each of the four possible cue combinations. In conditions with spatial and temporal cues, 4 objects will be presented their fixed locations and 4 words will be played such that the first word was the last word in the previous trials instead of random orders. Also,analysis the association between learning data and eye-gaze fixation patterns will give us a window to continuously measure what takes place with the cues.",>Roy Seo>Damian Fricker>Chen Yu,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0217/index.html
2011,Simultaneous Online Tracking of Adjacent and Non-adjacent Dependencies in Statistical Learning,"When children learn their native language, they have to deal with a confusing array of dependencies between various elements in an utterance. Some of these dependencies may be adjacent to one another whereas others can be separated by considerable intervening material. Research on statistical learning has begun to explore how such adjacent and non-adjacent dependencies may be learnedbut in separate studies. In this paper, we investigate whether both types of dependencies can be learned together, similarly to the task facing young children. Statistical learning of adjacent and non-adjacent dependencies was assessed using a modified serial-reaction-time task. The results showed (i) increasing online sensitivity to both dependency types during training, and (ii) non-adjacent dependency learning being highly correlated with adjacent dependency learning. These results suggest that adjacency and non-adjacency learning can occur in parallel and that they might be subserved by a common statistical learning mechanism.",>Loan Vuong>Antje Meyer>Morten Christiansen,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>Department of Psychology, Cornell University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0218/index.html

The question is why they fail to make the switch and perseverate at the first location. While these errors have often been attributed to cognitive limitations or stages of neurological development, we propose that they are consistent with the early stages of learning. We present a context-learning model of A-not-B search, in which learning to adopt the appropriate search strategy involves attending to appropriate contextual cues. We then present the findings of an eye-tracking experiment with 9 month-olds that behaviorally supports the predictions of our learning model.",>Hanna Popick>Melody Dye>Natasha Kirkham>Michael Ramscar,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0219/index.html
2011,Coincidence Detection: Towards an alternative to Synaptic Plasticity,"Memory and learning are believed to be neurally based on a general class of processes known as synaptic plasticity (Kandel et al., 2000). Working memory, however, is arguably too fast to rely solely on synaptic weighting and must instead take place as an active neural process (OReilly & Manukata, 2000). I propose that active processes, which can account for both simple stimulus based memories as well as simple associations, can be instantiated within populations of highly interconnected neurones that exploit the precise timing of spikes; I call these firing-chains. In a population of N neurones a maximum of T*2^N firing-chains exist over time period T, suggesting that many more firing-chains than neurones or connections exist. I aim to show how self-sustaining firing-chains can implement simple memories, but also that simple associations between two or more firing-chains can be made if their joint simultaneous activity triggers a new firing-chain.",>Francis Jeanson,>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0220/index.html
2011,Attentional Selection in the Unsupervised Generalized Context Model,"The distinction between supervised and unsupervised categorization has had a profound influence in related research. We consider a mechanism, attentional selection, possibly shared by models of supervised and unsupervised categorization. In supervised models such as the Generalized Context Model (GCM; Nosofsky, 1988), attentional selection emphasizes dimensions which are relevant for a taught classification. In a corresponding unsupervised version (the UGCM; Pothos & Bailey, 2009), attentional selection emphasizes stimulus dimensions which achieve the best separation of stimuli assigned to different categories. This approach unites the attentional mechanisms for supervised and unsupervised categorization, subject to the constraint that the assignment of stimuli to categories is exogenous in supervised categorization, but stimulus-driven in unsupervised categorization. In both cases, attentional selection is rational as it facilitates optimal category separation. We suggest that particular stimulus dimensions are attended if they make the target classification as intuitive as possible, whether categorization is supervised or unsupervised.",>Emmanuel Pothos>Todd Bailey,>Swansea University>Cardiff University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0221/index.html
2011,"Adaptive uses of random criterion: The largest number problem, the two-envelope problem, and the anchoring and adjustment heuristic","Many cognitive processes appear to incorporate threshold criteria, but when criteria are know to be random their use may appear irrational. For example, when peoples estimates are influenced by random anchors (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). However Cover (1987) showed that choosing whether a seen or unseen number was greater is improved by using a random number as a criterion. Such Cover functions are also the basis for solving the two-envelope problem. This solution suggests that peoples responses should be influenced by where a value falls in its distribution, a hypothesis supported empirically. The anchoring and adjustment heuristic can also be seen as application of a Cover function. Simulation can demonstrate that adjustment towards a random anchor from an initial random estimate will on average improve the final estimate. Anchoring and adjustment is an example of how Cover functions can contribute to understanding cognitive phenomena, and may have wide applicability.",>Bruce Burns,>University of Sydney,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0222/index.html
2011,MultiDimensional (MD) Frame: The Basic Elements of Memory Structure,"Object cognition occurs as follows: collecting information from the environment via perceptual sensors; integrating and segmenting the collected information, centering on visually collected objects; and continuing these processes until the necessary objects to live in the environment are obtained. These objects are then used independently in Systems 1 and 2 of Two Minds, and memorized after integrating related entities associated with each system. Due to the limitation of the brains processing capability, the range of integration is limited; therefore, System 1 memory and System 2 memory may differ. However, they may share objects originating from perceptual sensors. Thus, when objects that are the result of the just-finished integration and segmentation process are processed in the next cycle, representation of the objects may serve as the common elements to combine System 1 memory and System 2 memory to form an intersystem memory. We call this memory the MultiDimensional (MD) Frame.",>Makoto Toyota>Muneo Kitajima,>T-Method>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0223/index.html

Overall, our results support the idea that people switch between global frequency-based retrieval cues and local item-based retrieval cues to navigate their semantic memory. We extend this work by showing the involvement of an executive attention process, as switching is inversely correlated with digit span. Furthermore, our results reveal a further independent effect of aging, associated with increased switching between global and local memory cues for older individuals. These results are consistent with models of working memory and executive processing as representing a measure of goal perseveration and the ability to inhibit distracting information (Kane & Engle, 2004; Hills et al., 2010).",>Thomas Hills>Rui Mata>Andreas Wilke>Gregory Samanez-Larkin,>University of Basel>University of Basel>Clarkson University>Vanderbilt University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0225/index.html

Using a corpus that represents tonal regularities in Western music, Tillmann et.al (2000) developed a schema of Western tonal music. Krumhansl, et.al (2000) showed that melodic expectancy in Finnish music could be modeled by SOMs trained on samples of Finnish music. Recently, Schmuckler (2010) observed that a model of contour structure based on Fourier analysis could predict perceived melodic similarity. In this study, we investigated alternative SOM models of maqam music. Traditionally, maqams are defined by pitch structure and the structure of melodic contour, which are assumed to be independent.

2011,Memory for musical sequences beyond pitch: Grammatical and associative processes,"Memory for music can be detailed and concrete even without conscious effort to encode. We hypothesize that this is because of a symbiotic relationship between memory and musical structure. The stimuli in our experiments are drum patterns derived from a published corpus. The grammars of these patterns are asymmetric in their transition probabilities, sparse as matrix structures, and referential, in that one sound (instrument) is centrally connected to other sonic elements. Participants heard drum sequences taken from the corpus, or manipulated for the three significant features. They then identify examples as previously heard or as lures. Results to date confirm that memory is enhanced for sequences with grammars that are asymmetrical, referential, and sparse; manipulation of any of these factors degrades memory for these sequences. We propose that these three factors are primary cognitive elements of perception beyond the domain of musical pitch, and consider parallels with linguistic sound structure.",>Richard Ashley,>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0228/index.html
2011,Annotation as a (Meta)Cognitive Aid in Western Art Music Performance,"This paper examines the role of annotation in coordinating Western Art Music (WAM) performance. Annotations were obtained from a performance score drawn from an instrumental case study of ensemble performance. The case study consisted of nine videotaped rehearsals and a performance of Torû Takemitsus Masque for Two Flutes (1959-1960). A prior analysis of the conversation, body motion, and instrumental play revealed four domains of coordination. This paper presents a detailed exploration of one of those domains, annotation, using theory drawn from the field of distributed cognition. The annotations were classified by their function in supporting cognitive and meta-cognitive processes of performance in relation to the printed score (visual salience, repair/correction, and anchoring). The classification supports theory in distributed cognition by demonstrating a clear functional relation between the annotated score and both internal and external performance processes.",>Linda T.

2011,Can Neural Adaptation Explain Word Choice?,"Speakers refer to objects using terms on various levels of description. Labeling a poodle, they use the subordinate term poodle or the basic term dog. Our model attributes these effects to visual context, relying on the domain general mechanism of neural adaptation. Two SOMs represent visual and auditory categories. Word learning is modeled via simultaneous presentation of item and word form and the creation of Hebbian synapses. Neural adaptation causes a decrease of activation in repeatedly activated nodes. We predicted that as a result of this, when presented alone or alongside a distractor from another basic category, an item will be referred to by its basic term, while the presence of a distractor from the same basic category will induce a shift to the targets subordinate label. Three simulations taking into account the relative frequency of an item's basic and subordinate level labels supported this hypothesis.",>Jörn Klinger>Julien Mayor,>University of Texas at Austin>Basque Center on Cognition Brain and Language,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0230/index.html
2011,Relationship between Theory of Mind and Figurative Language Comprehension in Schizophrenia when controlling for IQ and Executive Functions,"In a previous study (Gavilán & García-Albea, 2009) 23 schizophrenic patients and 23 healthy controls were assessed in Theory of Mind (ToM) and Figurative Language Comprehension (FLC) abilities in order to explore the functional relationship between both capacities. We used 3 ToM and 3 FLC tasks. We found that ToM correlated high and significantly with FLC only in the group of patients. In the present study we aim to identify whether the association found in patients between ToM and FLC was genuine or it is better explained by impairments in general intelligence and/or executive functions. For that purpose, the same sample was assessed using a short form of the WAIS-III-R in order to estimate their IQ, and 7 Executive Functions (EF) tests to estimate their executive integrity. Results show that the correlation between ToM and FLC capacities remains significant when controlling either for IQ, or when controlling for EF.",>Jose M. Gavilan>Jose E.

2011,"Metacognitive Judgments, Study-Time Allocation and Inferences: The Effect of Multimedia Discrepancies","This study investigated undergraduate students metacognitive judgments while learning about complex science topics using multimedia material (text and graph). A within-subjects design was used to examine the effect of discrepancies on study-time allocation, metacognative judgments and inference generation. There were three types of discrepancies: none, text (between two ideas in the text) and text and graph (between the text and graph). Forty (N=40) participants completed 12 trials where they were asked to provide 6 judgments: Ease of Learning judgments (EOLs), immediate and delayed Judgments of Learning (JOLs) for both text and graph and Retrospective Confidence Judgments (RCJs). Participants provided significantly lower JOLs for content that contained discrepancies but RCJs remained high across conditions. Discrepancies did not influence study-time allocation, but did significantly influence inference scores. Overall, results suggest that participants may be aware of discrepancies, but lack the control strategies needed to overcome them.",>Candice Burkett>Roger Azevedo,">Department of Psychology, Institute for Intelligent Systems,

Randomness is defined in terms of radioactive decay whereas non-randomness is quantified by excess repetitions (i.e., repeat) or alternations between successive bits (i.e., switch). In four experiments, participants completed tasks including identifying the boundary between random and non-random textures, distinguishing random from non-random movement, learning to classify patterns, and tracking changes in successive matrices. Importantly, in task instructions, no mention was made of randomness, probability, or related concepts. We found superior performance in distinguishing random stimuli from repeat stimuli compared to switch stimuli. Moreover, memory for repeat stimuli declined as stimuli became more random, whereas memory for switch stimuli did not vary with the degree of non-randomness.",>Jiaying Zhao>Daniel Osherson,>Princeton University>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0233/index.html

We hypothesized that as this variation gets higher, speakers tend to include more redundant information in their target descriptions. The results showed that this was indeed the case. We suggest that scene variation causes speakers to make use of quick heuristics when selecting the content of their referring expressions, and discuss the implications of these findings for computational models that automatically generate referring expressions.",>Ruud Koolen>Martijn Goudbeek>Emiel Krahmer,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0234/index.html
2011,A Computational Model of Auditory Perceptual Learning: Predicting Learning Interference Across Multiple Tasks,"In this work we build a computational model of several auditory perceptual learning experiments. The modeled experiments show a pattern of learning interference which may help shed light on the structure of both short and long term stores of perceptual memory. It is our hypothesis that the observed interference patterns can be explained by the relationship of stimuli across tasks and how these relationships interact with the limits of human memory. We account for the fact that information is shared across tasks in our model through use of methodology from the machine learning community on transfer learning. When we introduce a set of plausible limits on memory, such a model demonstrates the same pattern of learning interference observed in the human experiments.",>David Little>Bryan Pardo>Beverly Wright,">Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University Evanston, IL 60208>Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University Evanston, IL 60208>Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Northwestern University Evanston, IL 60208, USA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0235/index.html
2011,The Role of Hierarchy in Learning to Categorize Images,"Converging evidence from anatomical studies (Maunsell, 1983) and functional analyses (Hubel & Wisesel, 1968) of the nervous system suggests that the feed-forward pathway of the mammalian perceptual system follows a largely hierarchic organization scheme. This may be because hierarchic structures are intrinsically more viable and thus more likely to evolve (Simon, 2002). But it may also be because objects in our environment have a hierarchic structure and the perceptual system has evolved to match it. We conducted a behavioral experiment to investigate the effect of the degree of hierarchy of the generative probabilistic structure in categorization. We generated one set of stimuli using a hierarchic underlying probability distribution, and another set according to a non-hierarchic one. Participants were instructed to categorize these images into one of the two possible categories a. Our results suggest that participants perform more accurately in the case of hierarchically structured stimuli.",>Reza Shahbazi>David Field>Shimon Edelman,">Cornell University, rs689@cornelll.edu>Cornell University, djf3@cornell.edu>Cornell University, edelman@cornell.edu",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0236/index.html

Ethicocentrism, Free Will, and the Fear of Decriminalization","Present-day legal judgments of psychopathological criminals strongly avoid the exploitation of moral considerations. Currently, the attribution of responsibility to criminals often takes advantage of the cognitive concept of mental incapacity so that, in these cases, the moral judgment about moral conducts of psycho-pathological criminals is potentially extinguished. We contend that the theories and methods that are currently used in western societies to discharge moral and legal responsibility are not clear in their epistemic structure and so partially unreliable. To support this conclusion we take advantage of our recent cognitive studies concerning the multiplicity of moral frameworks, the gene/cognitive niche co-evolution, and the concept of free will.",>Lorenzo Magnani>Emanuele Bardone>Tommaso Bertolotti,">Department of Philosophy, University of Pavia

We will claim that biases provide us with premissory starting points even in absence of relevant information to solve the problem at hand. In the second part, we will turn to the vices of biased rationality: we will contend that the adaptive value of fallacies are limited to those situations in which we do not have (relevant) information, whereas being in such a situation is not adaptive at all. We will point out that de-bising rationality is made possible when human learning becomes an option ecologically supported by the accumulation of knowledge in the human cognitive niche.

We define such a fragment in terms of joint commitments of the interactants, and analyze how these commitments are made in a conversation. We distinguish between three layers of joint commitments: those that regulate the embedding activity of the conversation; those that constitute the joint meaning of communicative acts; and those that concern the target of the conversation. We argue that joint commitments are created in a concrete situation by producing and negotiating interper¬sonal affordances, which allows the interactants to retain suitable freedom of movement. Finally, we analyze some relationships between our conception of communicative acts and illocutionary acts.",>Antonella Carassa>Marco Colombetti,">University of Lugano, CH>Politecnico di Milano, I

Metacognition is also known to be effective in enhancing creative thinking. Little is known, however, about how unconscious thought and metacognition interact. The current study first examined whether a hint that could not be consciously perceived has an effect on facilitating problem solving (Experiment 1). 102 participants tried to solve the nine-dot problem; half of them after exposure to a subliminal hint. The hint doubled the solution rate. Experiment 2 examined how this effect interacted with metacognitive instructions. 146 participants solved the same problem under one of four conditions defined by crossing exposure or nonexposure to a subliminal hint with metacognitive control instructions present or absent. The hint raised the solution rate and so did metacognition, but the effect almost disappeared when both were introduced. The results suggest that metacognitive control sometimes operates without monitoring.",>Masasi Hattori>Steven Sloman>Ryo Orita,>Ritsumeikan University>Brown University>Ritsumeikan University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0240/index.html
2011,Differences in Infants' Perception of Objects' Internal Energy as a Function of Their Roles in a Causal Event,"This study examined if 12- and 16-month-olds causal perception can guide their expectations about objects internal energy during stopping events. Thirty-seven infants were habituated to a causal event in which a red ball (agent) launched a green ball (recipient). Infants were tested on trials in which the agent and the recipient maintained their energy before stopping abruptly, or both objects lost energy as they stopped gradually. Preliminary results indicate that infants in both age groups looked significantly longer when agents lost energy than when they maintained it, but looked equally long at both trials for recipients. Results also show a trend of 12-month-olds looking longer than 16-month-olds at the recipient trials. Findings suggest that by 12 months, infants expect agents to maintain their internal energy, and that developmental changes in perceptions of recipients occur between 12 and 16 months. Fourteen-month-olds are currently being tested to clarify this developmental trend.",>Yevdokiya Yermolayeva>David H. Rakison,">Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University

Response-time differences between semantic categories were significant, F(4,217)=3.71, p<.01. Word frequencies were taken from Brysbaert and New's (2009) corpus of movie subtitles. Twenty percent of participants identified themselves as fluent in at least one language other than English. As expected, multilingual participants took longer to make lexical decisions, with an average RT for monolinguals of 764ms and 878ms for the multilingual group, F(1,217)=21.45, p<.001.

A short narrative film was presented, either chronological or with flashbacks. In Experiment 1, the gravity of the acts committed by the actors was perceived to be more salient in the linear than in the flashback version. Aesthetic assessment did not vary as a function of linearity. In reconstructing the movie segments into the right order, the linear film condition showed a better match with the chronological ordering than the flashback condition. In Experiment 2, pupil size of the viewers, as a measure of mental load, was registered on-line. In the flashback version, mental load was heightened. In the discussion intellectual versus narrative editing, intellectual editing lost the case in the present study.

2011,Looking at Nothing Diminishes with Practice,"People fixate on blank locations if relevant visual stimuli previously occupied that location; the so-called looking-at-nothing effect. While several theories have been proposed to explain potential reasons for the phenomenon, no theory has attempted to predict the stability of this effect with practice. We conducted an experiment in which participants listened to four different sentences. Each sentence was associated with one of four areas on the screen and was presented 12 times. After every presentation participants heard a statement probing one sentence, while the computer screen was blank. More fixations were found to be located in areas associated with the probed sentence than in other locations. Moreover, the more trials participants had completed, the less frequently they exhibited looking-at-nothing behavior. Fixations on blank locations seem to occur when an attempt is made to retrieve information associated with a spatial location as long as it is not strongly represented in memory.",>Agnes Scholz>Katja Mehlhorn>Franziska Bocklisch>Josef Krems,">Department of Psychology, Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany>Dept. of Artificial Intelligence

The blameworthiness rating was lower than the causality rating. Furthermore, the actor was judged less blameworthy when the actor was not intentional and when the result was not foreseeable. Cognitive load was manipulated in Experiment 2, to check whether any of the factors can be moderated by System 2 processes. Major findings of Experiment 1 were replicated. In addition, the difference between the two judgments was larger in the control condition than the two cognitive load conditions. The discounting effects of intentionality and the foreseeability were also larger in the control condition. Results of the two experiments were interpreted to suggest that intentionality and foreseeability work as discounting factors for blameworthiness especially when there is no cognitive load.",>Doehee Kim>Kyung Soo Do>Hanna Kim,">Sungkyunkwan University,

In the present study, participants were asked to solve a syllogistic reasoning task. Two kinds of irrelevant explanations were provided: mechanistic explanations (e.g., forces, cause-and-effect) and anthropomorphic statements (e.g., like, want). Participants were further told either that scientists or people provided the explanations. Descriptions of natural phenomena were presented ranging in terms of the extent to which they were human-like (e.g., molecules, snakes, human group) to alter the congruency of the explanations and descriptions. Supporting our earlier findings (Schoenherr & Thomson, 2009), we found that participants performed better when there was a congruency between the explanations and natural phenomena and when scientists provided mechanistic explanations and people provided anthropomorphic explanations.",>Boucher Lisa>Schoenherr Jordan>Thomson Robert>Lacroix Guy,>Carleton University>Carleton University>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0246/index.html

Despite their high degree of resemblance, both task types not only differ regarding their number of answer alternatives, but also regarding their directionality: The truth task concerns the evaluation of the given rule on the basis of situations, while the possibilities task concerns the assessment of situations with respect to the given rule. The aim of the present study is to assess whether participants answer patterns depend on the difference in directionality when the difference in number of answer alternatives is controlled for. Moreover, both implicit and explicit negations are used. Concerning the negation type, we find more three-valued patterns with implicit than with explicit negations. It was replicated that possibilities-tasks yield more two-valued answer patterns than truth-tasks, which in turn yield more three-valued patterns than possibilities-tasks.

2011,A closer look at moral dilemmas: latent structure of morality and the difference between the trolley and footbridge dilemmas,"Although moral dilemmas such as the trolley and footbridge dilemmas (Thomson, 1986) have been widely employed to investigate the nature of moral reasoning, but their psychometric properties remain a mystery. In this study, 219 participants completed 62 moral dilemma tasks used in Greene et al. (2001), and the correlation structure among the dilemmas was analyzed through factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The results show the following two points. First, the moral-personal dilemma tasks studied are composed of one factor, indicating that the assumption in Greene et al. (2001) was supported. Second, the trolley and footbridge problems fall into the same factor category; therefore, the difference between the two problems cannot be attributed to emotional involvement. In addition, results of the structural equation modeling suggest that they differ in engagement of the rational processing.

A preliminary study with undergraduates revealed difficulty with problems where a price increase of x% is followed by a decrease of the same percent, for example, x increases by 50% and then decreases by 50%. More than 75% of these problems were answered incorrectly (Jacobs, 2010). A second study, where N = 1629, presented percentage problems in either an algebraic or numerical format. The focus was on analyses of trends between and within subjects, including systematic error patterns, the effect of problem-solving representational formats, and problems that were easy.

2011,Remembering connectives: Visual-auditory consonance influences representations in time,"Reasoning errors often arise when information is represented incorrectly. One example is the conjunction effect, a tendency to misremember OR statements as AND statements. We investigated the how the time course of consonance between visual and auditory information influenced memory for connectives. We measured memory for statements after manipulating the consonance between language and visual information. The results indicated that subjects correctly recalled more statements given language-visual consonance and were more likely to false alarm (e.g., incorrectly recalling OR statements as AND) given language-visual dissonance. We modeled performance using a Simple Recurrent Network. Our model, in which the training set was structured similarly to natural language input, provided a reasonable analog. Taken together, the results suggest that connective representations are influenced by the concordance between visual and language input and that the bias toward conjunctions arises, in part, from the relatively high frequency of conjunctions in visual and linguistic input.",>Bradley Morris>Rebecca Neiman,>Grand Valley State University>Grand Valley State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0250/index.html
2011,Reconciling Competing Accounts of Picture Perception from Art Theory and Perceptual Psychology via the Dual Route Hypothesis,"The fine and applied visual arts and perceptual psychology use conflicting accounts of picture perception. In the arts, the human ability to perceive pictured objects is characterized as learned, or conventionalized, like a visual language (Gombrich, 1960; Goodman, 1976; Kulvicki, 2010). In perceptual psychology, picture perception is characterized as an unlearned, biologically grounded, ability. In this account, optical properties of light produced by pictures make use of biologically evolved capabilities to perceive surfaces and edges in actual environments (J. J. Gibson, 1978; Kennedy, 1974; Lee et al., 1980; Hammad et al., 2008). The purpose of this paper is to reconcile these competing claims through Goodale et al.s (2005) dual route hypothesis.

2011,A View of Language from Somewhere in Particular,"There are many ways of representing language as a physical organ that are made available by the human and the natural sciences. Shaping our understanding, such representations generate views of language that are simultaneously abstract and physical. These views are mediated both by theoretical accounts and imaging tools which both implicitly and explicitly localize and imagine language as an internal component of the mind/brain (e.g., Hauser, Chomsky & Fitch, 2002). This discussion attempts to extend existent representations of language as a physical structure by focusing on how and where language is localized in the neurosciences, philosophy, and linguistics. Viewed as a natural element of the world (Chomsky, 1995), hence also emerging from within the natural environment, language could be understood as not bound to a particular scale of representation. Blending theoretical with physical depictions of language, a perceptual model of language as a structure in the physical environment is explored.",>Jarek Sierschynski,>University of Washington,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0252/index.html
2011,Plan and Situated Action Relationship as a Function of Activity Category: An Experimental Approach,"Plan and situated action relationship has been an active area of debate in recent years in various fields of study yet such relationship has a propensity for ambiguity. It would be a limited/desperate argument to claim that plans can capture every level of detail. Needless to say, a model cannot exceed or equal reality. Given that a clear mismatch/incongruence or gap exists between plans and actual events, how do people experience this gap and how do they act accordingly? The proposed framework integrates the field theory of the here-and-now action developed by Kurt Lewin (1936), with both the prototype and basic-level category theories developed primarily by Rosch (1978). Lewins theory captures the dynamic properties of situations whereas Roschs categorization theories capture typifications of the human experience. More specifically, plans are conceived as an activity category-set of possibilities of some future events by which plans have categorical relationships with future actions.",>Walid Bahamdan>Rob Duimering,">Department of Management Sciences, 200 University Avenue West

2011,Therapeutic Animatron: Interaction Framework for Making People Happy,"There is an ongoing project to develop an interaction framework for creating animatronics creatures  therapeutic animatrons  which can elicit desired emotional states in humans. The acute need for such therapeutic devices stems from the growing aging population and increasing work and social stress. A real-time facial expression detection and gesture recognition system will assess the emotional state of a user. The assessed emotional state is used to derive an animatron (e.g. a cute teddy bear) controlled by servo motors. The system chooses one of the behaviours of Snow Whites seven dwarfs characters to adjust the emotional state of the user to the desired state. The best behaviour is selected using a Support Vector Machine classifier. There is massive potential for the incorporation of these sophisticated interaction frameworks within child education and psychiatry, as well as in relation to a number of other stress-related disorders in medicine more generally.",>Insu Song>Denise Dillon,>James Cook University>James Cook University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0254/index.html
2011,"Beliefs are represented as neither maps nor sentences in the head: ""Format blind"" processing and specialization for theory of mind","Is the encoding of content and format necessary for representing beliefs? In three experiments using false-representation tasks, we explored whether beliefs were processed like non-mental representations, under the assumption that non-mental representations require both content and format to be processed. First, beliefs were compared to sentences (linguistic medium) while keeping representational content constant, under either format-stressed (experiment 1) or content-stressed (experiment 2) conditions. Reaction time advantages for probes about belief over notes suggested belief processing did not include computational demands for specifying a linguistic format. In a third experiment comparing beliefs to maps (spatial medium), responses to probes about beliefs were faster than those to maps. These results suggest belief processing is format blind such that specification of a representational medium is unnecessary. This difference in computational demands between mental and non-mental representations may be a source of specialization for the processing of mental states like belief.",>Adam Cohen>Tamsin German,">Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara>Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0255/index.html
2011,THE COGNITIVE EFFECT OF PERSPECTIVE-TAKING ON SOCIAL COORDINATION,"Active perspective-taking (PT) has been argued to improve performance on social coordination tasks (Galinsky, Wang, & Ku, 2005). In most such tasks individuals are free to use any natural form of communication, making it difficult to differentiate between the effects of the empathic and cognitive aspects of PT. The Experimental Semiotics research paradigm (Galantucci & Garrod, 2011) provides social coordination tasks in which freedom of communication is reduced in a way that minimizes emotional communicative exchange. Pairs of participants played a cooperative guessing video-game in which they could communicate only via limited graphical exchanges.

2011,The Reverse-Chameleon Effect: Negative social consequences of anatomical mimicry.,"Mirror mimicry has well-known consequences for the person being mimicked: it increases how positively they feel about the mimicker (the Chameleon Effect). Here we show that anatomical mimicry has the opposite social consequences: a Reverse-Chameleon Effect. To equate mirror and anatomical mimicry, we asked participants to have a face-to-face conversation with a digital human (VIRTUO), in a fully-immersive virtual environment. Participants spontaneous head movements were tracked, and VIRTUO mimicked them at a 2-second delay, either mirror-wise, anatomically, or not at all (instead enacting another participants movements). Participants who were mimicked mirror-wise rated their social interaction with VIRTUO to be significantly more positive than those who were mimicked anatomically. Participants who were not mimicked gave intermediate ratings. Beyond its practical implications, the Reverse-Chameleon Effect constrains theoretical accounts of how mimicry affects social perception.",>Laura Staum Casasanto>Tom Gijssels>Daniel Casasanto,">MPI for Psycholinguistics

2011,Spontaneous goal inference without concrete external goals,"We automatically represent others actions in terms of their goalfor actions with concrete external goals (e.g. reaching for an object; Woodward, 1998). Is this true for actions without concrete external goals? We hypothesized that movement itself could be considered a goal, and that this inference forms part of concepts like dance, exercise and ritual. In a between-subject experiment, participants saw either (a)movements with no external goal (animated character moving in an empty room); or (b)identical movements, with an external goal (manipulating objects). We first determined what goal participants inferred, if any. Then, we asked participants if the actions could be dance, exercise, or ritual. Nearly half of participants in the no-external-goal condition inferred that the movements themselves were the goal. Participants who inferred movement-as-goal later rated the actions as more likely to be dance, exercise, or ritual, even compared to other participants who saw the exact same stimuli.",>Adena Schachner>Susan Carey,">Department of Psychology, Harvard University>Department of Psychology, Harvard University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0258/index.html

In two experiments, we show that television advertisements using the Repetition-Break plot structure are persuasive, leading to higher brand attitudes and purchase intentions than ads with alternative structures. This effect is partly attributable to comparison-induced surprise. Thus, we have evidence that a theoretically explainable and generic plot structure not only makes for interesting stories, it also makes those stories effective for persuasion.",>Jeffrey Loewenstein>Rajagopal Raghunathan>Chip Heath,>The University of Texas at Austin>The University of Texas at Austin>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0259/index.html
2011,Spatial Cognition Adapts to Social Context,"We present a dynamical systems model that captures human perspective-taking behavior in a visuospatial mental rotation task. The task requires participants to interpret an ambiguous request for a visual referent, either by taking their own perspective (egocentric; ""the referent is on my right"") or the perspective of the requester (other-centric; ""the referent is on your right""). Our primary interest lies in how perspective-taking behavior and spatial cognition adapt to socially-driven information. To do so, we manipulate whether the participant shares the same social status as their assumed interaction partner. We report critical influences of social role on response choice and on the processing demands required to enact the response. Furthermore, we discuss these results in the context of our computational model, showing that simple socially-induced constraints can produce rich behavioral patterns.",>Nicholas Duran>Rick Dale,">University of Memphis, Department of Psychology>University of Memphis, Department of Psychology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0260/index.html
2011,Experts and Novices Use of Gesture in Explaining Geologic Maps,"People gesture during spatial tasks (Alibali et al., 2001; Kita & Özyürek, 2003; Morsella & Krauss, 2004), and how they gesture reveals information about ongoing cognitive processes (Alibali & Kita, 2008; Church & Goldin-Meadow, 1986; Schwartz & Black, 1996). One task that requires many spatial processes is reading geologic maps. Geologic maps give information about the spatial relationships of geological structures at the surface that in turn can inform an expert about the underlying 3D structures. However, they are complex, contain both spatial and domain specific symbolic information, and are hard for students to understand. The current study compares how expert geologists and students use gesture in explaining these maps. We report gestures used to convey spatial information about the penetrative relations and those used to convey information about the sequences of events. Hand shape, orientation, placement, and movement of the gesture convey information that is not available is speech.",>Ilyse Resnick>Kinnari Atit>Tilbe Goksun>Thomas F.

2011,Allocentric Spatial Memory in Major Depressive Disorder,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with small hippocampal volume (Campbell et al, 2004). This structural change does not appear to be limited to later stages of the illness, but has been found in patients suffering their first episode (Frodl et al, 2002) and in healthy individuals at risk of depression (Chen et al, 2010). This suggests that small hippocampal volume may represent a vulnerability factor for developing the illness, which could potentially be detected through neurocognitive testing. The Northumberland Gallery Task was developed to contrast a cognitive ability that depends on hippocampal integrity (allocentric memory) with a cognitive ability that does not (egocentric memory). Here we present findings derived from this task in a small sample of depressed patients and matched controls. An allocentric deficit would be consistent with the small hippocampus in MDD and would support the use of neurocogntive testing in the detection of illness vulnerability.",>Jonna Nilsson>Kenny Coventry>Nicol Ferrier,">Newcastle University, UK

2011,How Do Younger and Older Adults Use Cues and Landmarks to Navigate?,"Although robust age effects on human navigation have been demonstrated, age differences in cue-use is poorly understood. In this study, older and younger adults completed a virtual environment (VE) navigation task. The environment contained cues divided into 2 categories. Critical cues (CC) were located at decision points, while non-critical cues (NCC) were located at non-decision points. Following learning trials, all subjects were given a cue recognition memory test and a cue-direction associative learning test. Older and younger subjects were equivalent in their recognition memory of CC and NCC. However, there were large age differences (younger > older) in cue-direction associative learning. In addition, younger participants showed better memory for CC versus NCC, whereas, older subjects showed no difference. Older adults are intact in landmark recognition but have difficulty associating these same landmarks with the correct direction. In addition, human aging is associated with decreased ability to filter irrelevant cue information.",>Scott Moffat,>Wayne State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0263/index.html
2011,How Spoken and Signed Language Structure Space Differently,"Spatial concepts are structurally represented in spoken language by a 3-level system. At the componential level, there is a relatively closed universally available inventory of fundamental spatial elements. At the compositional level, elements of the inventory combine in particular arrangements to form whole spatial schemas. Each language has a relatively closed set of ""pre-packaged"" schemas of this sort. And at the augmentive level, the system includes a set of processes that can extend or deform pre-packaged schemas, enabling a language's particular set of schemas to be applied to a wider range of spatial structures. Signed language structurally represents space with a different system seemingly more like visual parsing. It can mark finer spatial distinctions with its inventory of more structural elements. It can represent many more of these distinctions in any particular expression. It represents these distinctions independently in the expression, not bundled together into pre-packaged schemas. And its spatial representations are largely iconic with visible spatial characteristics. The findings suggest that instead of some discrete whole-language module, spoken language and signed language are both based on some more limited core linguistic system that then connects with different further subsystems for the full functioning of the two different language modalities.",>Leonard Talmy,">Department of Linguistics and     Center for Cognitive Science

2011,"The Number, Type, and Configuration of Landmarks Distort Distance Estimates","In phase 1, participants memorized two two-dimensional maps consisting of routes with concrete landmark features and two maps consisting of routes with abstract landmark features and then made distance estimates and mental walks for the routes on each map. Participants estimated significantly longer lengths for routes with concrete features versus abstract features, for routes with four versus two features, and for routes with linear sequences of features versus clustered features. In phase 2, a feature recognition task indicated that participants had significantly greater accuracy and faster response times for concrete features versus abstract features and for features that had appeared in linear arrangements versus clustered arrangements. Our results suggest that the number, type, and configuration of landmark features can distort humans memories of path lengths, even when the paths are originally viewed on a simple two-dimensional map rather than encountered through embodied experience.",>Michael E.

The paper mainly focuses on the question how humans integrate spatial information that initially appeared not to be linked. Two experiments investigated the construction processes of spatial mental models and the integration of additional information into existing models. The results show that combining information that are initially not related to one another takes longer and leads to more errors. Moreover, information presented in a continuous and a semi-continuous order was integrated sequentially, whereas information presented in a discontinuous order was first integrated sequentially into one temporary model and if necessary subsequently revised.",>Jelica Nejasmic>Antje Krumnack>Leandra Bucher>Markus Knauff,">Justus-Liebig University, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science, Otto-Behaghel-Str. 10F,

2011,Spatial Cognition and Perception of Large Scale Object Constellations: Evidence from Search Domain Analysis in Urban Environment,"Our study explores perception of urban environment and its encoding into the system of spatial prepositions. We explore the divergences between the physical topology and the cognitive topology of environment constrained by (a) geometric invariants (Landau & Jackendoff, 1993), (b) functional knowledge (Coventry & Garrod, 2004), (c) reference frame (Levinson, 1996), and (d) individuals spatial experience linked to a variety of social factors. Our results suggest that processing spatial environment generates a mental map containing different scopes of search domains for prepositions where the scope depends on the location of the living place (home) of the test person. We propose the following correlation: the more peripheral is the home of a test person the bigger is the scope of the search domain, e.g. the region denoted by near the house is larger for those who live in the periphery of a city.",>Jurģis ķilters>Ģirts Burgmanis>Zaiga Krijāne>Linda Apse,">Center for Cognitive Sciences and Semantics, University of Latvia, 1A Lomonosova Street

2011,Phrase Structure Priming Across Sentences: Facilitation or Reconfiguration?,"Structural priming, the tendency for speakers to reuse the structures of recent utterances (Bock, 1986) or to produce repeated structures more fluently, is well documented for structural selection, but less so for phrase structure generation. Priming of structural choices is long-lived, persisting across intervening utterances (Bock & Griffin, 2000), but priming of phrase structure does not survive even one intervening sentence (Wheeldon & Smith, 2003), suggesting that the processes may be different. Moreover, although Smith & Wheeldon (2001) found an initiation latency benefit of initial noun phrase priming, the main verb (move/s) was also constant. Here, we report a noun phrase structure repetition effect only when the entire verb phrase was also repeated. Because this effect is better accounted for as plan reconfiguration than as structural priming, previous reports of phrase level structural priming need to be reassessed.",>Alexandra K.

Trained participants significantly outperformed controls and showed limited transfer to untrained stimuli. Results were interpreted with respect to three theoretical accounts of improvement after training. Instance-based accounts attribute performance gains to a larger store of memories and predict no transfer to new stimuli or spatial processes. Process-based accounts attribute gains to increased efficiency of mental processes and predict general transfer to new stimuli and tasks sharing the same processes. Intuition-based accounts characterize learning as the accumulation of specific perceptual experiences and predict limited transfer. Performance gains and patterns of transfer were most consistent with intuition-based theory. The results suggest that interactive animation is an effective medium for training spatial visualization skills, particularly when supplemented with verbal instruction and physical models.",>Cheryl Cohen,">Post-doctoral Researcher, Department of Psychology, Northwestern University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0271/index.html
2011,Finger Based Representation of Numbers: Correlation Between Finger Tapping Ability and Digit Span,"Based on previous research on finger based representation of numbers, we investigated the relation between sequential finger tapping and numeric working memory. Subjects (N=44, all right handed) were given a sequential finger tapping (SFT) test and a forward and backward digit-span (FDS, BDS) test. SFT test measured the participants ability to execute simple (following the anatomical order) and complex finger tapping sequences with their right hands. We calculated two standardized scores, first involving all sequences (SFT) and second only complex sequences (cSFT). There were no significant correlations between SFT and both FDS (r=0.225, p=0.141) and BDS (r=0.210, p=0.170). However, cSFT scores correlated significantly with both FDS (r=0.304, p=0.045), and BDS [r=0.336, p=0.026]. Since independent movement of fingers relies on distinct finger representations, we interpret the results as finger representation involvement in numeric memory. The stronger correlation between cSFT and BDS might be due to the order processing involved in both.",>Firat Soylu>Sharlene Newman,">Department of Instructional Systems Technology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN

2011,Revising beliefs about imagined relations: the role of logic and content,"University students (n = 86) revised their beliefs about story-based relationships in the face of new, contradictory information. Prior to resolving an inconsistency, students drew a picture depicting the story information. Participants resolution of logical inconsistencies reflected (a) the structure of the facts at hand and (b) the relationship conveyed by the major premise (All p are q). Students were more committed to a story relationship when the contradiction challenged the outcome of a modus tollens (~q,~p) rather than modus ponens (p,q) inference. Commitment to story relations was also greater when p represented a cohesive group whose characteristic q was critical to their definition as a group. When p represented a more ambiguous group, students drew more people and were less likely to retain the story relations. The preference to preserve a generalization is dependent on the nature of the logical contradiction and its implications to group entitativity.",>Alexandra Chambers>Russell Revlin,>University of California Santa Barbara>University of California Santa Barbara,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0273/index.html
2011,From preferences to choices and back again: evidence for human inconsistency and its implications,"People's choices can be predicted given information about their preferences. Learning people's preferences is the inverse problem of inferring preferences from choices. Given the apparent relationship between choice prediction and preference learning, it is natural to ask whether the two are mutually consistent. Given weak assumptions, we show that no single, consistent model of the relationship between choices and preferences can explain both the choices people make and their inferences about others' preferences. This finding implies that people make systematic errors in learning about others preferences, and indicates that some accounts of preference learning, e.g., those based on simulating choices as well as unconstrained rational models, are inadequate. We also consider alternative assumptions, which allow consistent models but require a new interpretation of decoy effects in multiattribute choice.",>Christopher Lucas>Charles Kemp>Thomas Griffiths,">Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0274/index.html

Children made two kinds of errors on measuring objects not aligned with the beginning of the ruler - reading off the number that corresponded to the rightmost edge of the object (common in low SES children) and counting the number of hatch marks that the length of the ruler encompasses (common in high SES children). Experiment 1 showed that only children who counted hatch marks at pretest learned from training that made use of misaligned ruler items combined with unit chips. Experiment 2 used the same procedure but presented pairs of objects that ended at the same point on the ruler (e.g., 5 and 2 sticks that both aligned with 5 on the ruler). With this training, children benefited regardless of initial error type.

2011,Asymmetric Intercortical Projections Support The Learning Of Temporal Associations,"Neuroanatomists have identified an asymmetry in intercortical connections, with feedforward projections from the sensory periphery tending toward more focused and dense connection patterns in comparison to feedback projections, which tend to be more dispersed. Using a simple computational cognitive neuroscience model of approximately hierarchical processing in sensory cortices, we show how such asymmetric bidirectional connectivity supports the implicit learning of associations over time, with correlated stimuli separated by short delay periods. According to this model, the dynamics of recurrent connectivity in sensory hierarchies supports the persistence of representations of recently experienced stimuli, allowing those representations to become associated with stimuli consistently arriving after a short delay. These learned associations are embodied in feedback connections, with synaptic strengths modified by simple correlative (Hebbian) neural learning mechanisms. Furthermore, the presence of asymmetric forward and backward projections throughout the sensory hierarchy is shown to support implicit learning at multiple levels of featural abstraction.",>William Benjamin St. Clair>David C.

Participants were required to respond to immediate sound repetitions in a stream of simultaneously presented spoken words, and later given a surprise recognition test that measured recognition for the unattended words. Words that had been simultaneously presented with a sound repetition in the previous repetition detection task were later recognized at levels significantly below chance.

A subsequent recognition task was given for the previously presented irrelevant stimuli (words).

Our investigation starts from the mental model theory of reasoning (e.g., Johnson-Laird, 1983). An assertion such as not-p unless q has the same truth conditions as if p then q, but we argue that it is represented differently, that is, the initial mental models for these two connectives are not the same. The experiment is the first to investigate the role of age (by testing three age groups: nine-year-old, eleven-year-old and thirteen-year-old children) on reasoning with unless.

Seventy-one students were randomly assigned to the three conditions. Learning outcomes were measured by pictorial tests at three difficulty levels. Contrary to our expectations the results showed that the combined condition (multiple static-simultaneous visualizations with arrows) was worse than both other conditions on the critical intermediate tests. Therefore, it seems that multiple static-simultaneous visualizations without any further enriching components and single static visualizations with motion-indicators have their own facilitating effects on fostering mental animation. These effects are possibly caused either by supporting comparisons among simultaneously presented multiple pictures or by showing the dynamic information (more) explicitly and thereby stimulating and guiding mental imagery of the movements, respectively.",>Birgit Imhof>Katharina Scheiter>Jörg Edelmann>Julian von Ulardt>Peter Gerjets,>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center>Knowledge Media Research Center,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0280/index.html

Instead, evidence shows that people store linguistic material with a rich, detailed auditory and sensory-motor code that tends, in its details, to be unique for each speaker. The obvious phonological discreteness of languages reflects conventional categories of pronunciation but not discrete symbols. In learning to read, we all master the Speech-Letter Blend, so that letters can be effortlessly interpreted as speech when reading. This mapping between letters and speech, requiring many years of training, is apparently achieved in the Visual Word Form Area of cortex.

We zoom in on three structured samples of language (numerals; playing cards; and a corpus of artificial languages from Kirby, Cornish & Smith 2008) to quantitative explore and illustrate the idea that linguistic forms are nonrandom in that their structure reflects the structure of the meanings they convey. A novel methodology returns frequency spectra showing the distribution of character n-gram frequencies in our language samples. These spectra, purely derived from linguistic form, clearly reflect the quantitative structure of the underlying meaning spaces, as verified with a new information theoretical metric of compositionality. Moreover, analyses of a diachronic corpus of languages show that linguistic structure gradually adapts to match the structure of meanings over cultural transmission.",>Monica Tamariz,>The University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0283/index.html

Eye movements were recorded for participants who recalled a picture from memory while looking at a blank screen. All participants were tested for working memory capacity and the OSIVQ (Blazhenkova & Kozhevnikov, 2009) was used as an assessment for individual differences in object imagery, spatial imagery and verbal cognitive style. Results revealed a negative correlation between the overall spatial dispersion of eye movements and the spatial imagery score. Consequently, those with a lower spatial imagery score employed a larger degree of eye movements to blank spaces than those with a higher spatial imagery score. No relationship was found between eye movements and the other aspects. We propose that weaker spatial imagery ability increases the need to execute eye movements during recall and discuss this finding in relation to the current literature on eye movements to nothing.",>Roger Johansson>Jana Holsanova>Kenneth Holmqvist,">Department of Cognitive Science, Lund University>Department of Cognitive Science, Lund University>Humanities Laboratory, Lund University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0284/index.html
2011,Rapid extraction of event participants in caused motion events.,"When viewing a complex event, it is necessary to identify and calculate the relationships between different entities in the event. For example, when viewing a caused motion event (e.g. a man raking leaves into a basket.), people need to identify the Agent (man), the affected object or Patient (leaves), the Instrument (rake) and the Goal (basket). In this paper we explore how this process of event apprehension proceeds using eye-tracking methodology. Our study indicates that viewers extract event components rapidly, but some components can be extracted faster than others. Moreover, there is a structure to saccade patterns when participants are asked to identify specific event components. In caused motion events, attention is allocated to the Patient during the early stages of processing even when the Patient is not the target.

2011,Mathematical Cognition as Embodied Simulation,"Based on behavioral, neuroimaging and neuropsychological data, I argue that a key to understanding mathematical cognition is the sharing of neural resources between sensorimotor and mathematical processes. Mathematical cognition is embodied in the sense that it is grounded in simulations of sensorimotor processes through the use of neural resources that are also active in bodily perception and action. There are two approaches to the study of embodied mathematical cognition: Behavioral, neuroimaging and neuropsychological investigations providing empirical evidence, and the study of conceptual metaphors, focusing on how inferences from physical domains are used to understand abstract mathematical ideas.

2011,An fMRI Study of Zoning Out During Strategic Reading Comprehension,"Prior neuroimaging studies of discourse comprehension and strategic reading comprehension have shown that there are at least two networks of brain regions that support strategic discourse comprehension. In particular, strategic reading comprehension leads to activation of a domain-general control network as well as a network of regions supporting coherence-building comprehension processes. The present study was designed to further examine the neural correlates of strategic reading comprehension by examining the brain regions associated with zoning out, or mind wandering, while performing reading strategies on expository texts and diagrams. The results show that a region of dorsal prefrontal cortex was associated with increased frequency of zoning out, and the results provide an important replication or prior work by showing a high degree of consistency in the areas that are active while using reading strategies.",>Jarrod Moss>Christian Schunn>Walter Schneider>Danielle McNamara,>Mississippi State University>University of Pittsburgh>University of Pittsburgh>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0287/index.html
2011,Implicit Racial Stereotypes may Temporarily Shift after Reading a Story,"This study demonstrated that implicit preferences for Whites compared to Blacks can be temporarily (i.e., less than a week) reduced or reversed by reading a counter-stereotypical scenario about an assault. Explicit racial associations (i.e., White = Bad, Black = Good) appear to be not a crucial component of the scenario for shifting the bias but seem to play a role in increasing the malleability effect of implicit racial attitudes. When they were not included in the scenario, a reduction of the implicit preferences for Whites compared to Blacks (Experiment 2) was observed, whereas when they were included we found a reverse of the implicit racial bias indicating a preference for Blacks than to Whites (Experiment 1).",>Maddalena Marini>Sandro Rubichi>Giuseppe Sartori,>Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia>Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia>Università degli Studi di Padova,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0288/index.html
2011,What are the boundary conditions of differentiation in episodic memory?,"One of the critical findings in recognition memory is the null list-strength effect (LSE), which states that repeating study items does not hurt the performance of other studied items. Episodic memory models were able to predict the null LSE by using the principle of differentiation, in which repetitions of an item accumulate into a single strong memory trace. A hypothesized boundary of differentiation is that repetitions of an item in different contexts will create new traces. Two experiments tested this hypothesis by repeating words across different study-test cycles rather than within a single list followed by a test on all of the studied lists. Results indicated that as the proportion of strong items increased, there was both a null LSE and a non-significant decrease in the FAR, which is contrary to the predicted strength-based mirror effect. These two results in tandem provide a challenge for differentiation models.",>Adam Osth>Simon Dennis,>The Ohio-State University>The Ohio-State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0289/index.html

Of secondary interest is the potential for computational indices of cohesion and coherence to model human judgments of coherence. The results indicate that human judgments of coherence are the most predictive features of holistic essay scores and that computational indices related to text structure, semantic coherence, lexical sophistication, and grammatical complexity best explain human judgments of text coherence. These findings have important implications for understanding the role of coherence in writing quality.",>Scott Crossley>Danielle McNamara,>Georgia State University>The University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0290/index.html
2011,Adults and school-aged children accurately evaluate sins of omission in pedagogical contexts,"Recent formal models of pedagogy (Shafto & Goodman, 2008) assume that teachers provide evidence likely to increase the learners belief in a target hypothesis. Thus in pedagogical contexts, the learner can infer that evidence is not merely true of the concept but representative of it. If for instance, a teacher demonstrates a single function of a toy, the learner should assume that only that function exists. What happens when a teacher violates these pedagogical sampling assumptions (e.g., showing only one function of a toy with many functions)? If the learner discovers that the evidence is incomplete, does the learner evaluate the teacher accordingly? Here we show that, much as learners are sensitive to cases when informants are inaccurate (sins of commission), both adults and children are sensitive to sins of omission and penalize teachers who provide information that is accurate but incomplete.",>Hyowon Gweon>Hannah Pelton>Laura E.

In this work, we analyze data from a task involving a series of judgments of pain (discomfort) made by participants who were asked to place their hands in a bowl of water of varying temperature. Although trials in this task were separated by a minute in order to avoid sequential dependencies, we nonetheless ﬁnd that responses are reliably inﬂuenced by the recent trial history. We explore a space of statistical models to predict sequential dependencies, and show that a nonlinear autoregression using neural networks is able to predict over 6% of the response variability unrelated to the stimulus itself. We discuss the possibility of using decontamination procedures to remove this variability and thereby obtain more meaningful ratings from individuals.",>Benjamin Link>Brittany Kos>Tor Wager>Michael Mozer,">Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado>Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado>Department of Psychology, University of Colorado>Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0292/index.html
2011,Conditional Relational Reasoning,"Conditional reasoning - reasoning with if - is very common in everyday life. Consequently, all reasoning theories provide explanations for typical logical errors in conditional reasoning. The combination of conditional reasoning with spatial relational reasoning provides a new test-bed for these theories. Take, for instance, the two assertions If the church is to the left of the cinema then the cinema is to the left of the library and The church is to the right of the library. Can both assertion be true at the same time? The second statement links a term from the antecedent to the consequence. Such novel tasks pose significant problems for the reasoner, and extensions of classical theories differ in their empirical predictions. We report two behavioral experiments investigating conditional relational reasoning and provide support for predictions of the mental model theory.",>Marco Ragni>Tobias Sonntag,>University of Freiburg>University of Freiburg,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0293/index.html
2011,Language and Space: Momentary Interactions,"Does language change thought? This classical question has recently received renewed attention, as new lines of evidence have been offered, either supporting or arguing against the idea that speaking a particular language-- or having a language at all-- affects our non-linguistic representation. The domain of space has provided particularly fertile territory for this debate. In this talk, I will present a new hypothesis about the way in which language interacts with visual-spatial representations, arguing that this occurs on a momentary basis, with no repercussions for permanent changes in our non-linguistic spatial representation. These momentary interactions increase over development, resulting in obligatory linguistic encoding in many tasks, but no real change in non-linguistic representations. This hypothesis not only accounts for new data I will discuss; it also accounts for much of the existing data on both sides of the aisle, in domains as different as spatial cognition and the representation of color. Having a language undoubtedly changes human cognition-- but it does not change our non-linguistic representations.",>Barbara Landau,">241 Krieger Hall

2011,Bodily Relativity: The body-specificity of language and thought,"Do people with different kinds of bodies think differently? According to the body-specificity hypothesis (Casasanto 2009), they should. In this paper, I review evidence that right- and left-handers, who perform actions in systematically different ways, use correspondingly different areas of the brain for imagining actions and representing the meanings of action verbs. Beyond the concrete domain of action, the way people use their hands influences the way they represent abstract ideas with positive and negative emotional valence like goodness, honesty, and intelligence, and how they communicate about them in spontaneous speech and gesture. Changing how people use their right and left hands can cause them to think differently, suggesting that handedness is not merely correlated with cognitive differences.

The spatial descriptions were analyzed relating the level of knowledge to route efficiency, and to occurrences of particular linguistic elements. Results reveal a diversity of wayfinding and description strategies, ranging from generic methods via building specific strategies to classic turn-by-turn directions.

In Experiment 1, we examined improvement on a manual rotation task following practice in mental rotation, manual rotation and a control condition. Practice in mental but not manual rotation lead to improved performance on manual rotation, compared to the control condition. In Experiment 2, we examined improvement on a mental rotation task as a function of the same 3 training conditions. In this experiment, both mental and manual rotation practice lead to more efficient posttest performance relative to the control condition.

In doing so, they combine information from landmarks of different types. We deﬁne a Bayesian model that indicates how an ideal observer would optimally integrate landmark cues, and fit this model to the decisions made by squirrels in a spatial memory task. The resulting model provides a unifying framework for characterizing different strategies to cue integration, and a tool for investigating the circumstances under which particular cues are used. We show that the best fitting models changed depending on the season at testing and the details of the task.

Making an alternative relativistic assumption about the nature of reward leads us to formalize a rational agent as one which minimizes its internal decision-computational costs while retaining satisfactorily predictive models of its external environment.

2011,The evolution of irrational decision-making: insights from non-human primates,"Despite our species impressive cognitive sophistication, adult humans are nevertheless notoriously bad at making normatively rational economic decisions. Much work has examined the nature of biased decisions such as framing effects, the endowment effect, and the peak-end principle in adult humans; however, research examining the origins of these biases is still in its infancy. This paper examines existing work on origins of economic biases  that is, whether these biases are shared with non-human primates. We survey recent work using a comparative approach to address the evolutionary origins of several classic biases, such as loss aversion, reference-dependence, the endowment effect and the peak-end principle. Novel evidence is provided that the peak-end principle  a bias involved in retrospective evaluations  is also found in capuchin monkeys. These studies suggest that such biases emerged long ago in our evolutionary history, and shed light on the psychological mechanisms behind biased decision-making.",>Venkat Lakshminarayanan>Laurie Santos,>Yale University>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0302/index.html

This has been shown to work for many types of simple tasks, but has generally been performed on subjects that do not communicate with one another. We report group aggregation performance for more complex tasks, involving reconstructing the order of time-based and magnitude-based series of items from memory. In half of these tasks, subjects receive the previous subjects final ordering in a serial fashion. The aggregate for communicating subjects is better than that for independent subjects. We introduce a Bayesian version of a Thurstonian model to show how each subject combines their individual, private knowledge with the previous individuals ordering. The model also shows that individuals can produce estimates in the shared information condition that are better for aggregating than independent estimates.",>Brent Miller>Mark Steyvers,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0303/index.html

Next, subjects made the same judgments solely on the basis of probabilities given by multiple advisers who may have only received partial information. Experimental results confirm previous findings that decision makers give extreme estimates when advisers are in agreement and compromise estimates when advisors are in disagreement. Unlike previously proposed models that can only account for extreme or compromise estimates but not both, we develop a new Bayesian model that explains both types of judgments. This model provides a rational explanation of information aggregation by assuming that decision makers use the probability estimates of advisers to infer underlying data before making probability judgments.",>Jennifer Trueblood>George Kachergis>John Kruschke,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0304/index.html

Whereas social memory has often been studied independently from other memory research (e.g., Bond et al., 1985; Brewer et al., 1995), we focus here on possible parallels with search in other domainsin particular the thesis that search of social memory is governed by similar rules and processes as those that guide search in semantic memory and may involve executive processes. Such a connection would involve two claims: First, search in social memory dynamically transitions between local and global search strategies (similar to search of associative memory; SAM, Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981). Second, as proposed for a domain general executive search process (Hills et al., 2010; Hills et al., 2008), dynamic transitions should recruit the general control of attention.",>Thomas Hills>Thorsten Pachur,>University of Basel>University of Basel,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0306/index.html

This study explores how people deceive and how they deal with deceptive information in the context of a conceptual learning task. Participants play a game in which a learner infers the location of a rectangle based on the testimony of an informant, who is either helpful or deceptive. We investigate the behavior of both informants and learners in this scenario. On the informant level, we demonstrate that people provide different information depending on whether they are helpful or deceptive. Although deceptive informants do lie outright, they more often opt to mislead. From the learner perspective, we show that people do choose to verify information but no more often when the informant is deceptive. Despite this, we also find that learners are capable of accurately identifying who is deceptive and who is helpful.",>Robert Montague>Daniel J.

Both tasks allowed subjects to make holistic matches or analytic matches. One of two situational regulatory focus states (promotion, prevention) was induced in subjects before completion of the triad tasks. It was predicted that a promotion focus would engender a preference for holistic matches while a prevention focus would engender a preference for analytic matches. In the first experiment, promotion-focused subjects made more holistic matches than prevention-focused subjects. In the second experiment chronic regulatory focus was also measured, and subjects who experienced regulatory fit made more holistic matches than subjects who experienced regulatory mismatch, and situational regulatory focus alone did not significantly predict the proportion of holistic responses. These results suggest that both regulatory focus and regulatory fit states broaden attention, and that uncontrolled regulatory fit may be driving promotion focus effects.",>Ruby Nadler>John Paul Minda,>The University of Western Ontario>The University of Western Ontario,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0308/index.html

Numerous proposals as to the information processing mechanisms underlying human performance on the IAT have been suggested, many or all of which may well play a role. This makes it difficult to study them and their interactions experimentally in an efficient manner. We describe a localist connectionist model that simulates human performance on the IAT and that allows us to explore many of the proposed explanations, by comparing the results with observations from actual experiments with human subjects. By simulating the performance of virtual subjects, the model also makes it possible to conduct theoretical experiments that could not be undertaken with real subjects in the real world.",>Boon-Kiat Quek>Andrew Ortony,">Institute of High Performance Computing, Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore

We examined whether memory for conflicts and its application in an essay task could be enhanced by a combination of reading goals and text signals. Two high-coherence-orienting reading goals (reading to write a summary or an argumentation) were contrasted with a low coherence-orienting goal (composing a list of key words). Moreover, for half of the participants texts contained rhetorical connectors signaling the existence of conflicts, whereas the other half did not. A total of 184 undergraduates read multiple documents on a controversial medical issue. As expected, reading with high-coherence goals facilitated conflict recognition more than a low-coherence goal. The facilitative effect of signaling was particularly pronounced in the summary group. Moreover, participants in the signaling-condition and in the high-coherence goal conditions wrote the most integrated essays subsequent to reading.",>Marc Stadtler>Lisa Scharrer>Rainer Bromme,">University of Muenster, Germany>University of Muenster, Germany>University of Muenster, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0314/index.html

An experiment investigated explaining in the social context of learning to predict and explain individuals behavior, examining if explaining observations exerts a selective constraint to seek patterns or regularities underlying the observations, regardless of whether such patterns are harmful or helpful for learning. When there were reliable patterns such as personality types that predict charitable behavior explaining promoted learning. But when these patterns were misleading, explaining produced an impairment whereby participants exhibited less accurate learning and prediction of individuals behavior. This novel approach of contrasting explanations positive and negative effects suggests that explanations benefits are not merely due to increased motivation, attention or time, and that explaining may undermine learning in domains where regularities are absent, spurious, or unreliable.",>Joseph Jay Williams>Tania Lombrozo>Bob Rehder,">Department of Psychology, University of California Berkeley>Department of Psychology, University of California Berkeley>Department of Psychology, New York University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0315/index.html

Moreover, we proposed that longer inspection of a picture is necessary to provide learners with an alternative representation that fosters mental animation and recall. Participants (N=76) learned from a text about pulley systems, and in three out of four conditions from an additional picture of a pulley system. Students saw either the text only, the picture preceding the text for 150ms or 2sec, or received a self-paced presentation of the picture before the text. Results confirm our assumptions that presenting the picture for the time to extract the gist (2sec) before the text fostered comprehension, whereas only the self-paced presentation of the picture fostered mental animation and recall.",>Alexander Eitel>Katharina Scheiter>Anne Schüler,">Knowledge Media Research Center, Konrad-Adenauer-Str. 40, 72072 Tuebingen, Germany>Knowledge Media Research Center, Konrad-Adenauer-Str. 40, 72072 Tuebingen, Germany>Knowledge Media Research Center, Konrad-Adenauer-Str. 40, 72072 Tuebingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0316/index.html

We present a novel method for carrying out very large scale artificial language learning tasks over the internet, which allows us to test large batteries of systematically designed languages for differential learnability.

2011,When Hearing Lips and Seeing Voices Becomes Perceiving Speech: Auditory-Visual Integration in Lexical Access,"In the McGurk Effect, a visual stimulus can affect the perception of an auditory signal, suggesting integration of the auditory and visual streams. However, it is unclear when in speech processing this auditory-visual integration occurs. The present study used a semantic priming paradigm to investigate whether integration occurs before, during, or after access of the lexical-semantic network. Semantic associates of the un-integrated auditory signal were activated when the auditory stream was a word, while semantic associates of the integrated McGurk percept (a real word) were activated when the auditory signal was a nonword. These results suggest that the temporal relationship between lexical access and integration depends on the lexicality of the auditory stream.",>Rachel Ostrand>Sheila Blumstein>James Morgan,">University of California, San Diego>Brown University>Brown University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0319/index.html
2011,Bilinguals activate words from both languages when listening to spoken sentences: Evidence from an ERP-study,"The current study examines whether bilingual word recognition in spoken sentences is influenced by cross-lingual phonological similarity. ERPs were measured while German-English bilinguals listened to German sentences. Target words in the sentences were either German-English homophones (e.g., eagle  Igel hedgehog), German words that were phonologically closely related to English words (e.g., kitten  Kittel smock), or German words that had no phonological relation to English words (e.g., Ziegel brick). ERPs to target words showed an N400-like facilitation effect for words with cross-lingual phonological overlap (homophones and German-English related words) compared to words with no cross-lingual overlap. However, these results were restricted to bilinguals who learned both languages before age 6, but not for those bilinguals who learned English after age 6. This suggests that early bilinguals activate words from both languages when processing spoken sentences in their dominant language-context.",>Nicole Altvater-Mackensen>Nivedita Mani,>Georg-August-Universität Göttingen>Georg-August-Universität Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0320/index.html
2011,﻿Comparisons in Category Learning: How Best to Compare For What,"Learners frequently compare across examples of categories in order to learn more about them. Surprisingly little work has been done looking at how the type of comparison one engages in during learning affects what information is eventually learned. Across three experiments we show that the type of comparison, either within-category or between-category, affects what conceptual information is acquired and the benefits of each type of comparison change depending on the type of category one is learning.",>Erin Higgins>Brian Ross,>University of Illinois>University of Illinois,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0321/index.html
2011,Beyond probability gain: Information access strategies in category learning,"The present study uses eye-tracking to study information access in the context of category learning. Prior research has pointed toward the importance of probability gain, the increase in the chance of getting an answer correct, as a key variable in determining what information is considered most useful to acquire before making a classification decision. We manipulate the probability gain of three features in a four-category learning task by changing the base rates of the categories to be learned. Using participants eye-movements to determine the order in which they acquire information after many trials of training, we find that increasing the probability gain of a feature does bias participants first fixation. However, participants strategies for acquiring feature information indicate they are more sensitive to efficiency goals: even with the low cost of eye-movements, participants direct attention to maximize efficiency, and do so without trading-off accuracy.",>Kimberly Meier>Mark Blair,>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0322/index.html
2011,Estimating the strength of unlabeled information during semi-supervised learning,"Semi-supervised category learning is when participants make classification judgements while receiving feedback about the right answers on some trials (labeled stimuli) but not others (unlabeled stimuli). Sporadic feedback is common outside the laboratory, and it is important to understand how people learn in this setting. While there are numerous recent studies, the strength and robustness of semi-supervised learning effects remain unclear, particularly when labeled and unlabeled stimuli are dispersed across learning. We designed an experiment, using simple unidimensional category learning, that allows us to measure the relative contribution of labeled and unlabeled experience. Based on an analysis of this task, we find that an unlabeled stimulus is worth more than 40% of a labeled stimulus.",>Brenden Lake>James McClelland,>MIT>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0323/index.html
2011,Reasoning with Conjunctive Causes,"Conjunctive causes are causes that all need to be present for an effect to occur. They contrast with independent causes that by themselves can each bring about an effect. We extend existing causal power representations of independent causes to in-clude a representation of conjunctive causes. We then demon-strate how independent vs. conjunctive representations imply sharply different patterns of reasoning (e.g., explaining away effects for independent causes as compared to exoneration ef-fects for conjunctive causes). An experiment testing how peo-ple reason with independent and conjunctive causes found that their inferences generally matched the models prediction, al-beit with some important exceptions.",>Bob Rehder,>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0324/index.html
2011,Finding the Cause: Examining the Role of Qualitative Causal Inference through Categorical Judgments,"Previous work showed that people‟s causal judgments are modeled better as estimates of the probability that a causal relationship exists (a qualitative inference) than as estimates of the strength of that relationship (a quantitative inference). Here, using a novel task, we present experimental evidence in support of the importance of qualitative causal inference. Our findings cannot be explained through the use of parameter estimation and related quantitative inference. These findings suggest the role of qualitative inference in causal reasoning has been understudied despite its unique role in cognition. Further, we suggest these findings open interesting questions about the role of qualitative inference in many domains.",>Michael Pacer>Woo-kyoung Ahn,">University of California, Berkeley>Yale University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0325/index.html
2011,Uncertainty and dependency in causal inference,"When inferring causal relationships, people are often faced with ambiguous evidence. Models of causal inference have taken different approaches to explain reasoning about such evidence. One approach  epitomized by Bayesian models of causal inference  defers judgment by representing uncertainty across multiple explanations. Another approach  usually adopted by associative models  approximates uncertainty by positing within-compound associations, a special type of association that forms between simultaneously presented cues. Although these approaches explain many of the same experimental findings, we note some limitations of the latter approach. In two experiments, we tested the predictions of these approaches. The results were consistent with models that represent uncertainty across multiple explanations and inconsistent with models that use within-compound associations.",>Christopher Carroll>Patricia Cheng>Hongjing Lu,">Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles>Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles>Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0326/index.html

In the present study we examine explanatory schemata  a set of interrelated concepts - that are deemed relevant to participants. Participants were first trained in a syllogistic reasoning task and were then presented descriptions of natural phenomena and explanations. An instructional manipulation varied the source of the explanations (scientists or people) as well as the animacy of the natural phenomena (living or nonliving). Explanations used either mechanistic (e.g., force) or anthropomorphic (e.g., wants) terms.

While in many cases, people cooperate, as in teaching settings, people can misdirect others in order to protect their own interests. \citeA{shaftoEtAl08} formalized teaching and learning from teachers as Bayesian inference, in which learners use knowledge about the teacher's intent to facilitate inference. This same model provides a basis for exploring reasoning about misleading. We present two new experiments comparing reasoning about teaching and misleading. In both experiments, participants play the role of informant (teacher/misleader) or learner. Our model predicts and our results show that people's behavior differs in teaching and misleading conditions, both when intentions are explicitly known as well as when they are not. Further, the model provides close fits to informants' and learners' behavior.",>Russell Warner>Todd Stoess>Patrick Shafto,>University of Louisville>University of Louisville>University of Louisville,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0328/index.html
2011,Brief Familiarization Primes Covert Imitation in 9-month-old Infants,"Previous research reveals that 9-month-old infants who passively observe an experimenter search repeatedly for a toy in the Piagetian A-not-B error task covertly imitate these actions and manually search incorrectly when the toy is hidden in the B-location. Two experiments tested whether infants would also search incorrectly if the experimenter was replaced by a pair of mechanical claws or if the experimenter performed less familiar actions. Although infants did not commit the search error when tested directly without any familiarization to the novel actions, a significant majority of infants committed the search error following two minutes of familiarization with the actions performed on the A trials. These results converge to suggest that infants brief experiences with observing actions will facilitate the activation of a corresponding motor representation. Furthermore, the specific process by which this facilitation occurs varies with the similarity between the observed action and its motor representation.",>Bennett Bertenthal>Ty Boyer,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0329/index.html
2011,The Influence of Writing Experiences on Holistic Processing in Chinese Character Recognition,"Holistic processing has been shown to be a behavioral marker of face recognition and object recognition in experts. We tested Chinese literates who can read and write Chinese characters (Writers) and Chinese literates whose reading performance far exceeded their writing ability (Limited-writers). We found that Writers perceived Chinese characters less holistically than Limited-writers. In addition, the holistic processing effect was found to be dependent of writing experiences rather than reading and copying performances. This effect may be due to Chinese Writers exhibiting a better awareness of the orthographic components of Chinese characters than Limited-writers. While Hsiao and Cottrell (2009) showed that reduced holistic processing is a marker of visual expertise in Chinese character recognition, our findings further suggest that such reduction is related to writing experiences in Chinese. This study is also the first to report on the Chinese reading population that has far poorer writing performance than reading performance.",>Ricky Van Yip Tso>Terry Kit-fong Au>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao,">Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0330/index.html
2011,Gesture During Mental Rotation,"Speakers gesture at high rates when explaining their solutions to spatial problems. The present work investigates one possible explanation for why speakers gesture so frequently during spatial problem solving, namely, that when speakers imagine the problem components in motion, they are particularly likely to gesture. We compared speakers gesture rates as they actively solved a mental rotation problem and as they described the end state of the problem. Speakers gestured at a higher rate in the rotation condition. Thus, it appears that thoughts about the problem pieces in motion in the rotation condition do lead to increased gesture rates.",>Autumn Hostetter>Martha Alibali>Anne Bartholomew,>Kalamazoo College>University of Wisconsin-Madison>University of Wisconsin-Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0331/index.html
2011,"Gesturing by aphasic speakers, how does it compare?","We compared gesturing by aphasic speakers to that of healthy controls, to see if gesture degrades with speech, or can be compensatory. We found that gestures by aphasics were less informative than those of controls, and that gestures by people with severe aphasia were less informative than those by people with mild aphasia. We also found that aphasics tended to use fewer representation techniques in gesture than healthy controls who were asked to use gesture instead of speech. These results suggest that in aphasia, gesture tends to degrade with speech, rather than it being compensatory. This implies that the processes underlying speech and gesture production may be tightly linked or shared.",>Lisette Mol>Emiel Krahmer>Mieke Van de Sandt-Koenderman,">Tilburg Center for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), Tilburg University, The Netherlands>Tilburg Center for Cognition and Communication (TiCC), Tilburg University, The Netherlands>Rotterdam Neurorehabilitation Research (RoNeRes) Rijndam

Executive functioning may be of particular consequence for students with disabilities who may already be at risk for academic and learning problems. One domain of executive functioning, working memory, may be especially crucial for academic performance. This symposium will present research that takes knowledge of cognitive science to the realm of educating children with disabilities. The projects include both the exploration of executive functioning skills and the development of strategies aimed at improving executive functioning in children with disabilities.

2011,The Role of Cross-cutting Systems of Categories in Category-based Induction,"Prediction is arguably the most fundamental problem that people face. Having discovered that some object possesses a particular feature, how is it that people are able to accurately infer that another object exhibits the property? Psychologists have actively studied this reasoning process; yet, current models of induction cannot provide an explanation for the entirety of the related phenomena. One reason may be that current models fail to account for people's ability to assess multiple categories when making an inference. Building on previous research (Shafto et al., 2006), we present a model of inductive reasoning based on cross-cutting knowledge representation. We present an experiment that investigates the ability of this model to account for known inductive phenomena. We show that a model which assesses multiple kinds of knowledge explains the flexibility of human inference, better than models relying on a single kind of knowledge.",>Neil Smith>Patrick Shafto,>University of Louisville>University of Louisville,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0335/index.html
2011,A mechanism to increase argument strength with negative evidence,"In most cases, if relevant, positive evidence raises and negative evidence lowers argument strength in induction. Previous research, however, has shown that it is possible to raise the argument strength of a single positive premise argument by introducing negative evidence (Heussen, et al., 2011). Here we test one possible mechanism for such an increase in argument strength. When people consider the positive premise they develop a set of hypotheses. Subsequently encountering a negative premise would render some of these hypotheses less likely and hence, if participants see the hypotheses as an exhaustive set, shift the probability to the remaining hypotheses to varying degrees. We test this idea by asking people to choose between four hierarchically nested conclusions across various conditions of evidence. The results are discussed in the light of models of induction.",>Daniel Heussen>Wouter Voorspoels>Gert Storms,>University of Leuven>University of Leuven>University of Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0336/index.html
2011,Preparing Students for Effective Explaining of Worked Examples in the Genetics Cognitive Tutor,"This study examines the impact of integrating worked examples into a Cognitive Tutor for genetics problem solving, and whether a genetics process modeling task can help prepare students for explaining worked examples and solving problems. Students participated in one of four conditions in which they engaged in either: (1) process modeling followed by interleaved worked examples and problem solving; (2) process modeling followed by problem solving without worked examples; (3) interleaved worked examples and problems without process modeling; or (4) problem solving alone. Tutor data analyses reveal that process modeling led to faster reasoning and greater accuracy in explaining problem solutions. Process modeling and worked examples together led to faster reasoning in problem solving than did any of the other three conditions. Students in all conditions achieved equivalent problem-solving knowledge, as measured by posttest accuracy, although the tutor results suggest reasoning speed may be a more sensitive measure of learning.",>Albert Corbett>Ben MacLaren>Angela Wagner>Linda Kauffman>Aaron Mitchell>Ryan Baker>Sujith Gowda,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Worcester Polytechnic Institute>Worcester Polytechnic Institute,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0337/index.html
2011,A Computational Model of Complex Skill Learning in Varied-Priority Training,"We developed a computational model that captures the differential effects of Fixed Priority (FP) and Varied Priority (VP) training on complex skill learning. The model is developed based on learning mechanisms associated with the modular circuits linking Basal Ganglia, the prefrontal association cortex, and the pre-motor cortex. Two forms of learning occur simultaneously. In discrimination learning, goal-directed actions are selected through recognition of external stimuli through the connections between the frontal cortex and the striatum, and is mediated by dopaminergic signals through a reinforcement learning mechanism. With practice, skill learning shifts from discrimination learning to Hebbian learning, which directly associates stimuli to responses by strengthening the connection between the prefrontal and pre-motor cortex. The model explains why VP training benefits lower performance participants more, and why learning was more strongly correlated with the size of the striatum in VP than FP training.",>Wai-Tat Fu>Panying Rong>Hyunkyu Lee>Arthur Kramer>Ann Graybiel,>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0338/index.html
2011,Inferring Conceptual Structure from Cross-Language Data,"Semantic categories vary across languages, but this variation is constrained: many logically possible semantic categories are not attested, and similar categories often appear in unrelated languages. This pattern suggests a universal conceptual basis to the variation, such that different languages provide different snapshots of the same conceptual terrain. A semantic map is a means of capturing this idea. Formally, a semantic map is a graph in which vertices represent different semantic uses or functions, and edges connect closely related uses. It is assumed that the graph structure is universal, and that language-specific categories always pick out connected subgraphs of the universal graph. A semantic map thus compactly represents what patterns of variation one may and may not expect to find in a given semantic domain, in terms of presumptively universal conceptual structure. Semantic maps have been widely used recently (e.g. Haspelmath, 2003; Croft, 2003; Cysouw et al., 2010).",>Terry Regier>Naveen Khetarpal>Asifa Majid,">UC Berkeley>University of Chicago>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0339/index.html
2011,Core phonology: Evidence from grammatical universals,"The human capacity for language is one of the most contentious topics in cognitive science. While some researchers attribute language to domain-general mechanisms, others postulate a specialized language system. When it comes to the phonological component, however, even proponents of domain-specificity concede that specialization is unlikely (Fitch et al., 2005). Phonological competence, in this view, is the product of experience, auditory perception, and motor control. And indeed, phonological systems are intimately grounded in phonetics. But while the domain-general perspective can account for this fact, it offers no explanation for several key features of language. It fails to explain why all languagessigned and spokenhave a phonological system, why phonological systems emerge spontaneously, in the absence of a model, and why the cultural invention of reading and writing invariably recapitulates phonological principles. Such observations, however, are readily explained by the view of phonology as a core knowledge system.",>Iris Berent,>Northeastern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0340/index.html
2011,Investigating the effects of prestige on the diffusion of linguistic variants,"Language, arguably the cognitive capacity that distinguishes humans, is a dynamic complex adaptive system whose structure and evolution is influenced by a host of factors. This paper takes a population dynamics approach to investigate the diffusion of linguistic variants in populations, focusing on the effect of differential prestige of linguistic variants and of speakers. A novel method that combines computer simulation with mathematical modeling is applied to the specific aim of identifying factors that formally constitute selective pressures on variant diffusion. Of the factors studied, only the intrinsic prestige of variants is found to pose selective pressure, while speakers prestige merely modulates variant spread.",>Monica Tamariz>Tao Gong>Gerhard Jaeger,>The University of Edinburgh>The University of Hong Kong>The University of Tubingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0341/index.html
2011,Semantic structure in improvised communication,"Recent studies have shown that people, when asked to communicate about simple events in an improvised manner, i.e., using only gesture and no speech, consistently use a sequencing that corresponds with SOV order. We present experimental data showing that SOV is not the only order that emerges, and that 'intensional events' give rise to a different ordering: SVO. We conclude that the semantic properties of the events that are communicated about play a role in the sequencing of utterances in emerging language systems. Further, we hypothesise that in simple language systems the sequencing of elements has a communicative function. We present a second study, which shows that different ordering of the constituents in improvised communication sequences results in different interpretations.",>Marieke Schouwstra>Anouschka van Leeuwen>Nicky Marien>Marianne Smit>Henriette de Swart,">UiL OTS, Utrecht University>Utrecht University>Utrecht University>Utrecht University>UiL OTS, Utrecht University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0342/index.html
2011,Learning Linear Spatial-Numeric Associations Improves Memory for Numbers,"Memory for numbers improves with age and experience. We tested the hypothesis that one source of this improvement is a logarithmic-to-linear shift in childrens representations of numeric magnitude. In Experiment 1, we found that linearity of representations improved with age and that the more linear childrens magnitude representations were, the more closely their memory of the numbers approximated the numbers presented. In Experiment 2, we trained children on a linear spatial-numeric association, and we found that children who learned to represent numbers as increasing linearly with numeric magnitude also improved their memory for numbers. These results suggest that linear spatial-numeric associations are both correlated with and causally related to development of numeric memory.",>Clarissa Thompson>John Opfer,>The University of Oklahoma>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0343/index.html

One source of this improvement may be childrens learning linear representations of numeric magnitude, but previous evidence for this hypothesis may have confounded memory span with linear numerical magnitude representations. To obviate the influence of memory span on numerical memory, we examined childrens ability to recall a single number after a delay, and the relation between recall and performance on other numeric tasks. Linearity of numerical performance was consistent across numerical tasks and was highly correlated with numerical memory. In contrast, color memory was not correlated with recall of numeric information. Results suggest that linear representations of numeric magnitudes aid memory for even single numbers.",>Christopher Young>Francesca Marciani>John Opfer,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0344/index.html
2011,Evidence against a strong association between numerical symbols and the quantities they represent,"Are numerals divorced from a sense of the actual quantities they represent? We show that accessing a sense of how much a numerical symbol actually represents is a surprisingly difficult and non-trivial process. Irrespective of numerical size or distance, direct comparison of the relative quantities represented by symbolic and non-symbolic quantities leads to performance markedly worse than when comparing two non-symbolic quantities. Experiment 2 shows that this effect cannot be attributed to differences in perceptual processing streams. Experiment 3 shows that there is no additional cost of mixing two formats that are both symbolic; that is, the decrement in mixing formats is specific to mixing symbolic and non-symbolic representations. Our data are consistent with the view that numerical symbols operate primarily as an associative system in which relations between symbols come to overshadow those between symbols and their quantity referents.",>Ian Lyons>Daniel Ansari>Sian Beilock,>University of Chicago>University of Western Ontario>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0345/index.html

An analysis of peoples patterns of responding during the elicitation of uncertainty, indicates that there are markers of confidence incorporated into these estimates that can be used to predict the persons true level of confidence. One such marker is the precision (number of significant figures) of the estimate. Analyses of elicited data show the expected positive relationships between accuracy, precision and explicit confidence and, further, that precision offers information beyond that of explicit confidence ratings. We then demonstrate the importance of incorporating this information on an overconfidence task, showing that it can account for a 9% difference in calibration.",>Matthew Welsh>Daniel Navarro>Steve Begg,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0346/index.html

2011,Is the Centrality of Design History Function an Effect of Causal Knowledge?,"Design history function (i.e., what an artifact was made for) is a central aspect of artifact conceptualization. A generally accepted explanation is that design history is central because it is the root cause for many other artifact properties. In Exp. 1, an inference task allowed us to probe participants causal models, and then to use them when making predictions for Exp. 2. Design history was, in fact, part of what participants viewed as conceptually relevant. Predictions for Exp. 2 were derived using the currently most comprehensive theory about how causal knowledge affects categorization. Our results show that though participants used design history, functional outcome and physical structure to conceptualize artifacts, the effect of design history was independent from knowledge of physical structure and functional outcome.

Standard verbal two-dimensional reasoning problems were presented auditorily along with visible context. In one condition, the visual-verbal interplay was designed to limit the number of interpretations that participants should consider for a set of premises. Past research has shown that visual context does not appear to limit the number of interpretations participants produce in this domain. In the present study, however, participants responses, premise processing times, and gaze behavior confirmed that the interplay of visual and verbal information successfully directed participants towards a single interpretation when functional constraints disambiguated spatial relations. The results corroborate theories of situated language processing and demonstrate perceptual grounding and functional modulation in spatial reasoning.",>Georg Jahn>Miriam Müller-Bardorff>Kenny Coventry,">Department of Psychology, University of Greifswald>Department of Psychology, University of Greifswald>Cognition and Communication Research Centre, School of Life Sciences, Northumbria University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0349/index.html
2011,Probabilistic internal physics models guide judgments about object dynamics,"Many human activities require precise judgments about the physical properties and dynamics of moving objects. Classic work suggests that people's intuitive models of physics are relatively poor and error-prone, based on incorrect general principles or highly simplified heuristics that apply only in special cases. These conclusions seem at odds with the breadth and sophistication of naive physical reasoning in real-world situations. Our work measures the boundaries of people's physical reasoning and tests the richness of intuitive physics knowledge. Participants in four experiments made quantitative judgments about stability and other physical properties of virtual 3D towers. Their judgments correlate highly with a model observer that uses simulations based on realistic physical dynamics and sampling-based approximate probabilistic inference to efficiently and accurately estimate these properties. Several alternative heuristic accounts provide substantially worse fits. We conclude that rich internal physics models are likely to play a key role in guiding human common-sense reasoning.",>Jessica Hamrick>Peter Battaglia>Josh Tenenbaum,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0350/index.html

Do speakers keep track of partner-specific information about the common ground status of names? And if so, what mechanisms support this ability? We present a series of experiments that investigate the nature of the memory representations involved in supporting speakers ability to distinguish shared from privileged information. The results of these experiments suggest that category information can be used as a cue to aid retrieval of ground status, and that shared experience plays an important role in helping speakers to distinguish privileged information from shared information.",>Kristen S.

2011,Effects of speaker gaze on spoken language comprehension: task matters,"LListeners can use speakers' gaze to anticipate upcoming referents. We examined whether this listener benefit is affected by different comprehension subtasks. A video-taped speaker referred to depicted characters, using either a subject-verb-object or a non-canonical object-verb-subject German sentence. She shifted gaze once from the pre-verbal to the post-verbal referent, a behavior that could allow listeners to anticipate which character would be mentioned next. We recorded participants' eye movements to the characters during comprehension, as well as post-sentence verification times on whether a subsequent schematic depiction correctly highlighted the patient (Experiment 1) or the thematic role relations of the sentence (Experiment 2). Sentence structure affected response times only when verifying thematic roles. The eye movement data also showed reliable differences between tasks, regarding effects of sentence structure and their modulation by speaker gaze. We argue that processing accounts of situated comprehension must consider task effects on the allocation of visual attention.",>Helene Kreysa>Pia Knoeferle,">Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster, Bielefeld University>Cognitive Interaction Technology Excellence Cluster, Bielefeld University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0352/index.html

We present a systematic, quantitative study of patterns of repair in two corpora: ordinary dialogues from the British National Corpus (BNC) and task-oriented dialogues from the HCRC Map Task. We use this analysis to evaluate three hypotheses about patterns of repair 1) social preferences 2) processing demands and 3) dialogue co-ordination. The results show that repair is more frequent in task-oriented dialogue, that use of repair is broadly unaffected by familiarity or mode of interaction but substantially affected by task roles. We argue that the complimentary patterns of repair used by conversational partners support the view of repairs as an integrated, cross-turn and cross-person, system for sustaining the mutual-intelligibility of dialogue.",>Marcus Colman>Patrick Healey,>Queen Mary University of London>Queen Mary University of London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0353/index.html
2011,Predictability effects in adult-directed and infant-directed speech: Does the listener matter?,"A well-known effect in speech production is that more predictable words tend to be phonetically reduced. Recent work has suggested that predictability effects result from hardwired properties of the language production system, rather than active modulation by the talker to accommodate the listener. However, these studies investigated only minor manipulations of listener characteristics. Here, we examine predictability effects with two very different listener populations: adults and preverbal infants. Using mixed effects regressions on spontaneous speech corpora, we compare the effect of word frequency, probability in context, and previous mention on word duration in adult-directed and infant-directed speech. We find that the effects of preceding context and word frequency differ according to listener. Contrary to previous work, these results suggest that talkers do modulate the phonetic effects of predictability based on listener characteristics. To our knowledge, this study is also the first published analysis of predictability effects in infant-directed speech.",>John Pate>Sharon Goldwater,>The University of Edinburgh School of Informatics>The University of Edinburgh School of Informatics,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0354/index.html

2011,Visualizing thought: Mapping category and continuum,"Abstract thought has roots in the spatial world. Abstractions are expressed in the ways things are arranged in the world as well as the ways people talk and gesture. Mappings to the page should be better when they are congruent, that is, when the abstract concept matches the spatial one. Congruent mappings can be revealed in peoples performance and preferences. Congruence is supported here for visual representations of continuum and category. Congruently mapping a continuous concept, frequency, to a continuous visual variable and mapping a categorical concept, class inclusion, to a categorical visual variable were preferred and lead to better performance than the reverse mappings.",>Barbara Tversky>James Corter>Lixiu Yu>David Mason>Jeffrey Nickerson,">Teachers College, Columbia University>Teachers College, Columbia University>Stevens Institute of Technology>Teachers College, Columbia University>Stevens Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0356/index.html
2011,Do you have to look where you go? Gaze behaviour during spatial decision making,"In this paper we present an eye-tracking experiment investigating the relation of gaze behavior, spatial decision making and route learning strategies. In the training phase participants were passively transported along a route consisting of 18 intersections. Each intersection featured two landmarks, some of which were unique while others were non-unique. In the test phase participants were presented with static images of the intersections and had to indicate the direction in which the original route proceeded. We report systematic gaze bias towards the eventually chosen movement direction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by dissociating the decision relevant information from the location to which a response is directed, these gaze bias effects can be systematically modulated. The results provide novel insights into how attentional processes mediate performance in a route memory task and are related to current theories of visual decision making.",>Jan Wiener>Olivier De Condappa>Christoph Hölscher,">Psychology,

2011,Prepositions in and on retain aspects of spatial meaning in abstract contexts,"Prepositions such as in and on convey not only spatial relationships between objects, but also abstract relationships, such as Mary is in love and Tims on a roll. Although such uses are often thought to be purely idiomatic, we hypothesized that these abstract, non-spatial relationships might preserve one specific aspect of prepositions spatial meaning: the degree to which the figure or the ground controls the figure-ground relationship (Coventry, 1992; Coventry, Carmichael & Garrod, 1994; Feist & Gentner, 1997, 1998, 2003). We found that locus of control distinguishes in and on in common abstract metaphorical contexts (e.g., in love/on a roll), matched abstract contexts (e.g., in/on time), and novel abstract contexts. These findings suggest that prepositions retain aspects of their spatial meaning when used abstractly.",>Anja Jamrozik>Dedre Gentner,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0358/index.html
2011,Does Space Structure Spatial Language? Linguistic Encoding of Space in Sign Languages,"Spatial language in signed language is assumed to be shaped by affordances of the visual-spatial modality where the use of the hands and space allow the mapping of spatial relationships in an iconic, analogue way and thus to be similar across sign languages. In this study, we test assumptions regarding the modality-driven similarity of spatial language by comparing locative expressions (e.g., cup is on the table) in two unrelated sign languages, TİD (Türk İsaret Dili, Turkish Sign Language) and DGS (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, German Sign Language) in a communicative, discourse context. Our results show that each sign language conventionalizes the structure of locative expressions in different ways, going beyond iconic and analogue representations, suggesting that the use of space to represent space does not uniformly and predictably drive spatial language in the visual-spatial modality. These results are important for our understanding of how language modality shapes the structure of language.",>Pamela Perniss>Inge Zwitserlood>Asli Özyürek,">Radboud University Nijmegen & Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Radboud University Nijmegen & Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands>Radboud University Nijmegen & Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0359/index.html
2011,Word Learning through Sensorimotor Child-Parent Interaction: A Feature Selection Approach,"This paper presents a computational model of word learning with the goal to understand the mechanisms through which word learning is grounded in multimodal social interactions between young children and their parents. We designed and implemented a novel multimodal sensing environment consisting of two head-mounted mini cameras that are placed on both the childs and the parents foreheads, motion tracking of head and hand movements and recording of caregivers speech while they were engaged in a free-play toy-naming interaction. A probabilistic model was developed that can predict the childs learning results based on sensorimotor features extracted from child-parent interaction. More importantly, through the trained regression coefficients in the model, we discovered a set of perceptual and motor patterns that are informatively time-locked to words and their intended referents and predictive of word learning. Those patterns provide quantitative measures of the roles of various sensorimotor cues that may facilitate word learning.",>Chen Yu>Junming Xu>Xiaojin Zhu,>Indiana University - Bloomington>University of Wisconsin-Madison>University of Wisconsin-Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0360/index.html
2011,Markers of Discourse Structure in Child-Directed Speech,"Although the language we encounter is typically embedded in rich discourse contexts, existing models of sentence processing focus largely on phenomena that occur sentence internally. Here we analyze a video corpus of child-caregiver interactions with the aim of characterizing how discourse structure is reflected in child-directed speech and in children's and caregivers' behavior. We use topic continuity as a measure of discourse structure, examining how caregivers introduce and discuss objects across sentences. We develop a variant on a Hidden Markov Model to identify discourses, using speakers' intended referent and the time delays between utterances. Using the discourses found by this model, we analyze how the lexical, syntactic, and social properties of caregiver-child interaction change over the course of a sequence of topically-related utterances. Our findings suggest that cues used to signal topicality in adult discourse are also available in child-directed speech and that children's responses reflect joint attention in communication.",>Hannah Rohde>Michael Frank,">Department of Linguistics

2011,Learning Simple Statistics for Language Comprehension and Production: The CAPPUCCINO Model,"Whether the input available to children is sufficient to explain their ability to use language has been the subject of much theoretical debate in cognitive science. Here, we present a simple, developmentally motivated computational model that learns to comprehend and produce language when exposed to child-directed speech. The model uses backward transitional probabilities to create an inventory of 'chunks' consisting of one or more words. Language comprehension is approximated in terms of shallow parsing of adult speech and production as the reconstruction of the child's actual utterances. The model functions in a fully incremental, on-line fashion, has broad cross-linguistic coverage, and is able to fit child data from Saffran's (2002) statistical learning study. Moreover, word-based distributional information is found to be more useful than statistics over word classes. Together, these results suggest that much of children's early linguistic behavior can be accounted for in a usage-based manner using distributional statistics.",>Stewart M. McCauley>Morten H.

2011,Effects of Semantic Integration and Advance Planning on Grammatical Encoding in Sentence Production,"To examine how semantic integration and the scope of advance planning affect utterance planning and subject-verb agreement error rates, participants described picture displays using subject noun phrases (e.g., the apple for the pie(s)), with singular head nouns and local nouns in prepositional phrase modifiers, and then completed them as sentences. Semantic integration (the conceptual link between elements within a phrase; Solomon & Pearlmutter, 2004) was manipulated by varying the preposition used to link the head and local noun. SOTs and agreement errors were recorded. Speakers were faster to initiate speech when the head and local noun were integrated than when they were unintegrated. Agreement errors were more likely when the local noun was plural than when it was singular. Supporting the scope of planning account (Gillespie & Pearlmutter, 2011), slower initiators produced more agreement errors, suggesting that speakers who do more advance planning are more likely to experience interference.",>Maureen Gillespie>Neal J.

2011,Distal prosody influences lexical interpretation in online sentence processing,"Previous work examining prosodic cues in online spoken word recognition has focused primarily on local cues to word identity. However, recent studies have suggested that sentence-level prosodic patterns can also influence the downstream interpretation of lexically ambiguous syllables (Dilley & McAuley, 2008; Dilley, Mattys, & Vinke, 2010). To test the hypothesis that these distal prosody effects are based on expectations about the organization of upcoming material, we conducted a visual world experiment using fixations to competing alternatives such as ""pan"" and ""panda"", which differ in the presence or absence of a prosodic boundary after ""pan(-)"". As predicted, the acoustic properties of distal sentence material affected the proportion of fixations to the monosyllabic competitor beginning 200 ms after the onset of the target word. These findings support the hypothesis that expectations based on perceived prosodic patterns in the distal context influence lexical segmentation and recognition.",>Meredith Brown>Anne Pier Salverda>Laura C.

2011,"Cloze but no cigar: The complex relationship between cloze, corpus, and subjective probabilities in language processing","When performing online language comprehension, comprehenders probabilistically anticipate upcoming words. Psycholinguistic studies thus often depend on accurately estimating stimulus predictability, either to control it or to study it, and this estimation is conventionally accomplished via the cloze task. But we do not know how effectively --- or even, strictly speaking, whether --- cloze probabilities reflect comprehender predictions. This is both methodologically worrisome and an obstacle to detailed understanding of online predictive mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate first that cloze probabilities vary substantially and systematically from normative corpus statistics, and secondly that some portion of these deviations are also reflected in online comprehension measures. Therefore, while there is some reason to be concerned that cloze norming may be distorting the results of psycholinguistic studies, these apparent distortions may instead reflect genuine errors in native speakers' probabilistic models of their language.",>Nathaniel Smith>Roger Levy,">UC San Diego, Cognitive Science>UC San Diego, Linguistics",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0366/index.html
2011,Individual differences in visual comprehension of morphological complexity,"This paper explores individual variability in processing morphological complexity. We examined the eye-movement record that 71 readers showed during reading of suffixed words (truck+er): the readers also took part in a battery of 17 verbal skill tests. Statistical analyses revealed that an individual's ability to segment words and level of reading comprehension shifted the balance between the whole-word recognition route and its recognition via decomposed morphemes. Effects of whole-word frequency and base morpheme frequency were observed in both good and poor readers, yet their qualitative nature varied by skill. Good readers suffered from lexical competition between whole-words (trucker) and base morphemes (truck), while poor readers received a recognition boost from base words. We discuss these interactions in the context of computational models of morphological processing and argue that readers engage sources of morphological information strategically, depending on the quality of representations for both the complex words and their morphemes.",>Victor Kuperman>Julie Van Dyke,>McMaster University>Haskins Laboratories,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0367/index.html
2011,Rethinking the role of error in attentional learning,"Learning how to allocate attention properly is essential for success at many tasks. Extant theories of categorization assume that learning to allocate attention is an error-driven process, where shifts in attention are made to reduce error. The present work introduces a new measure, error bias, which compares the amount of attentional change in response to incorrect responses versus correct responses during category learning. We first confirm that prominent categorization models predict high amounts of error bias. We then test this prediction against human eye-tracking data from 384 participants. Across 7 of 8 data sets we find that participants show minimal or no error bias. This finding suggests that attentional learning mechanisms, as implemented in influential computational models, cannot be generalized to account for measures of overt attention.",>Mark Blair>Calen Walshe>Jordan Barnes>Lihan Chen,>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0368/index.html
2011,Perceptual Fluency Affects Categorization Decisions,"Learning in the prototype distortion task is thought to involve perceptual learning in which category members experience an enhanced visual response (Ashby & Maddox, 2005). This response likely leads to more efficient processing, which in turn may result in a feeling of perceptual fluency for category members. We examined the perceptual fluency hypothesis by manipulating fluency independently from category typicality. We predicted that when perceptual fluency was induced using subliminal priming, this fluency would be misattributed to category membership and would affect categorization decisions. In a prototype distortion task, participants were more likely to judge non-members as category members when they were made perceptually fluent with a matching subliminal prime. This result suggests that perceptual fluency can be reflective of category membership and may be used as a cue during some categorization decisions. In addition, the results provide converging evidence that some types of categorization are based on perceptual learning.",>Sarah J Miles>John Paul Minda,>The University of Western Ontario>The University of Western Ontario,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0369/index.html
2011,A Tale of Two Processes: Categorization Accuracy and Attentional Learning Dissociate with Imperfect Feedback,"The present study used eye-tracking to examine the relationship between attention and category learning in probabilistic environments. While training, participants received either perfect feedback (100% accurate), or one of three different levels of probabilistic feedback (87.5%, 75% or 62.5% accurate). It was found that participants in the 87.5% condition were more accurate than participants in the other two probabilistic feedback conditions. However, despite their greater accuracy, participants in the 87.5% condition continued to attend to irrelevant information as frequently as those in the other two probabilistic conditions. This shows that: (1) cues that are not utilized in making a categorization decision may still be frequently attended to, and (2) attentional learning is not as tightly coupled to improving accuracy as current formal models suggest.",>Caitlyn McColeman>Aaron Ancell>Mark Blair,>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University>Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0370/index.html

Using a variety of stimulus sets, we compare the results of iterated learning experiments with human learners to results from two prominent classes of computational models: prototype models and exemplar models.

Because forgetting curves are emergent, it is not likely that a single simple function will be able to model them. Forgetting at different time scales is similar because similar dynamics occur at each scale and not because there is a single underlying mechanism that produces them.

Their meaning is an ongoing matter of debate, and some researchers argue they reflect the tendency for neural and bodily systems to poise themselves near critical states. A spiking neural network model is presented that self-tunes to a critical point in terms of its spike branching ratio (i.e. critical branching). The model is shown to exhibit 1/f scaling near critical branching, as well neural avalanches, and critical branching is associated with maximal computational capacity when assessed in terms of reservoir computing.

In the present study, a generic microcircuit model is presented that self-tunes its recurrent spiking dynamics to its critical branching point. The model is shown to have generic memory capacity that can be tapped for the purpose of visual motion processing.

Two experiments examined learners beliefs when first encountering novel cues. The results suggest that the introduction of the novel cue in the second phase of a blocking paradigm adds uncertainty and that learners entertain the possibility that novel cues are preventative.

Predictions of the causal model approach match those of linear models under certain circumstances and heuristic models under others, while making unique predictions in additional cases. In two experiments, we show that, as the causal relationships among cues changes, participant judgments consistently conform to predictions of the causal model approach while matching either heuristic or linear judgments in only a limited subset of cases.",>Abigail B.

This method produced a prior on causal strength that was quite different from priors previously proposed in the literature on causal induction. The predictions of Bayesian models using different priors were then compared against human judgments of strength of causal relationships.

Experiment 1 shows that in a team challenge in which players contribute sequentially, the last players blame or credit for a performance is reduced if the teams result is already determined prior to his acting. However, credit and blame attributions still vary with quality of performance in these cases. This finding is at odds with Spellman (1997) who proposed that a persons perceived contribution varies with the degree to which it changes the probability of the eventual outcome. Experiment 2 illustrates that the rational order effect does not overgeneralize to situations in which the experienced order of events does not map onto the objective order of events.

The CAV framework exploits wearable sensors such as cameras, GPS and ambient computing facilities to empower a users vision and memory functions by answering four types of queries central to visual activities. Learning of EVM relies on both frequency-based and attention-driven mechanisms to store view-based visual fragments (VF), which are abstracted into high-level visual schemas (VS), both in the visual long-term memory. During inference, the visual short-term memory plays a key role in the schematic representations of, and the similarity computation between, a visual input and a VF, exemplified from VS when necessary.

Nevertheless we still lack a full understanding of the visual, semantic, and memory processes governing visual attention. In this paper, we present a computational model of visual search capable of predicting the most likely positions of target objects. The model does not require a separate training phase, but learns likely target positions in an incremental fashion based on a memory of previous fixations. We evaluate the model on two search tasks and show that it outperforms saliency alone and comes close to the maximal performance the Contextual Guidance Model can achieve (CGM, Toralba et al., 2006, Ehinger et al., 2009), even though our model does not perform scene recognition or compute global image statistics.",>Michal Dziemianko>Moreno I.

2011,Cued Attention and Learning of Spatial Context in Children,"The contextual cueing effect refers to a robust phenomenon in which repeated visual context guides attention to relevant information by constraining search (Brady & Chun, 2007; Chun & Jiang, 1998). The effect is measured by an object search task in which a target is located within repeated or non-repeated visual contexts. Shorter response times for the repeated configurations indicate that contextual information has facilitated search. Though the effect is robust among adult participants, recent attempts testing the effect with children yielded mixed results (e.g., Vaidya, Huger, Howard & Howard, 2007). Because contextual cuing could play a critical role in cognitive development, resolving this issue is important. The present study used child friendly paradigms to investigate whether children are sensitive to repeated contextual information. The study suggests that children as young as 3 and half year olds successfully show the contextual cuing effect when visual search tasks are age appropriate.",>Hanako Yoshida>Kevin Darby>Joseph Burling,>University of Houston>University of Houston>University of Houston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0385/index.html
2011,The Developmental Role of Attentional Control in Language Learning,"Attention is essential for all learning. Increasing research suggests that bilingual children have advanced (relative to monolingual children) development of attentional control. The present study includes 80 bilingual and 80 monolingual child participants from a variety of language and age groups (2.5 to 5 year-olds) to systematically investigate how early learning/exposure to more than one language is related to the developmental shift of attention and its implications in early word learning. Results from the present study support an initial bilingual advantage in the Attention Network Test (ANT; a nonlinguistic tasks measuring attentional shifting), with monolinguals demonstrating comparable performance over time. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between overall accuracy on ANT trials and MCDI, specifically on the selected lexical category of Adjectives. The current study provides new insights into the early developmental trajectory of attention among monolingual and bilingual children and how attention may be crucial for early word learning.",>Duc Tran>Hanako Yoshida,>University of Houston>University of Houston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0386/index.html
2011,The Typology of Chinese in Talmys Verb-framed vs Satellite Framed Languages,"Talmy proposed that languages fall into two types on the basis of where the semantic component of PATH is conflated in a Motion event. In his bifurcation, if the PATH is characteristically represented in the main verb of a sentence, the language is verb-framed, if it is characteristically represented in the satellite of the verb; the language is satellite-framed. In this framework, Chinese falls into Satellite-framed languages. It was argued by other studies suggesting that Chinese does not neatly fit either category. Slobin (2004) proposed a third category of equipollently-framed languages. In this three category typology, Chinese falls into ""equipollently framed"" languages. This paper intends to make a comprehensive exploration on corpus based data of serial verbs in Chinese, examining their 1) main verb properties; 2) satellite properties; 3) PATH constituent conflation characteristics, in an attempt to delineate a clearer picture for the typological status of Chinese language.",>FUYIN LI>Suying LI,>Beihang University(BUAA)>Beihang University(BUAA),https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0387/index.html
2011,Towards a cross-linguistic scale for pragmatics of deference and closeness,"Social status and relationships affect language production. Consider the converse: can socio-cultural information be inferred from linguistic evidence? Specific phenomena naturally vary by language, so an intermediate variable, language use, abstracts over diverse phenomena such as formal/informal pronouns (Russian vy), indirect/direct phrasing (English), or related features (e.g. Navajo fourth person, Faltz 1998 p. 32). Typical scales for socio-cultural analysis use labels or natural numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) as in teineigo, sonkeigo, and kenjogo for Japanese keigo (Wetzel 2004, p. 4). Labels do not translate well, but neither do natural numbers: The bottom level ""1"" in each language may describe dissimilar situations; the middle level in one language may be 3 but in another 2. What scale might work cross-linguistically? We introduce a scale with ""zero"" as a neutral level, developed for closeness and deference in Tamil, Korean, and Russian. We also examine French, Hindi, and English examples.",>Gregory Aist>Prakalp Sudhakar,>Iowa State University>Iowa State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0388/index.html
2011,Naming and the Animal Concept in English and Indonesian Speakers,"In English, the word animal applies to both humans and non-human animals; in Indonesian, the word (hewan) does not apply to humans. In this study, English and Indonesian speakers made yes/no class-inclusion judgments for statements about animals. An interesting pattern was found among Indonesian (but not English) speakers: 9-year-olds agreed that mammals are animals and denied that humans are either mammals or animals (logically consistent), while adults agreed that humans are mammals and that mammals are animals but denied that humans are animals (logically inconsistent). Further, English-speaking children were more likely than Indonesian-speaking children to agree that mammals are animals and that humans are mammals. We suggest that (a) the Indonesian naming practice may have consequences for childrens acquisition of the hierarchical relationships between HUMAN, MAMMAL, and ANIMAL, and (b) the apparent decline in logical consistency among Indonesian speakers may reflect a conflict between categorical knowledge and well-established naming practices.",>Florencia K.

2011,The Whole Number Bias in Fraction Magnitude Comparisons with Adults,"The current study examines the extent to which the whole number bias, especially whole number ordering, can interfere with adult understandings of fractions. Using the framework theory approach to conceptual change as outlined by Vosniadou (2007; Vosniadou, Vamvakoussi & Skopeliti, 2008), this study supports the idea that initial concepts formed in childhood can have lasting effects into adulthood. Twenty-eight CMU undergraduates participated in a fraction magnitude comparison task. Half of the fraction comparisons were designed with the larger fraction consistent with whole number ordering; the other half was inconsistent. Comparisons in the consistent condition had the larger magnitude fraction have larger whole number parts than the opposing fraction. Comparisons in the inconsistent condition were the opposite. Participants were more accurate and faster to respond to comparisons in the consistent condition, supporting the hypothesis that an initial concept of number as natural number constrains operations with fractions even in adults.",>Melissa DeWolf>Stella Vosniadou,>Carnegie Mellon University>National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0390/index.html
2011,The Absence of Positive Affect is Associated with Complex Rule Use,"Two experiments explore the effects of mood on category learning. In the first experiment subjects were put into either a negative or a neutral mood before completing one of two category-learning tasks. Negative mood briefly impaired rule-based category learning but this impairment did not persist throughout the task. Negative mood did not influence non-rule-based learning. In a second study subjects learned one of three category sets (easy rule-based, hard rule-based, non-rule-based) by Shepard, Hovland & Jenkins (1961) and completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). A significant negative correlation was found between hard rule-based performance and subject scores on the BDI-II. No significant correlations were found between subject scores on the BDI-II and easy rule-based or non-rule-based performance. These results suggest that negative affect does not significantly impair category learning but the absence of positive affect (as measured by the BDI-II) is negatively related to complex rule use.",>Ruby Nadler>John Paul Minda,>The University of Western Ontario>The University of Western Ontario,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0391/index.html
2011,Cost of Attention as an Indicator of Category Learning,"Category learning often involves selective attention to category relevant information, which may result in learned inattention to category irrelevant information. This learned inattention is a cost of selective attention. In the current research, the cost of attention was used as an indicator of category learning. Participants were given a category learning task, and the amount of supervision given to them was manipulated. Along with behavioral data, recorded eye movements during the task showed signature patterns of learning via a cost of attention. In addition, a simple neural network (perceptron) was able to use these eye-tracking data to predict success in learning. Thus, the observed attentional pattern  the cost of selective attention  was proposed as an indicator of category learning.",>Hyungwook Yim>Catherine Best>Vladimir Sloutsky,">Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University

2011,Breaking the World into Symbols,"How do people come to assign symbolic labels to continuous dimensions? Previous work has shown that prediction-error-driven models are sensitive to the order of labels and exemplars during training; similar patterns of learning are found found in adult learners trained to associate labels with discrete visual stimuli. Here we provide further evidence in support of the hypothesis that an error-driven mechanism underlies word learning, using continuous stimuli to explore the interactions of temporal structure, stimulus frequency, and distinctiveness in shaping associative learning. We conclude that learning to use features of exemplars to predict labels results in over-representation of diagnostic information, as shown by improved associative performance on stimuli near category boundaries. This is consistent with an error-driven model of label acquisition, and highlights the importance of the associative and prediction-based (rather than exclusively syntactic) aspects of symbolic cognition.",>Adam November>Nicolas Davidenko>Michael Ramscar,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0393/index.html
2011,A Model of Concept Generalization and Feature Representation in Hierarchies,"We present a novel modeling framework for representing category exemplars and features. This approach treats each category exemplar as a probability distribution over a hierarchically structured graph. The model jointly learns the mixture of each exemplar across categories in the graph, and a feature representation for each node in the graph, including nodes for which no data is directly observed. We apply this model to two distinct types of data: Animal by Feature matrices, and Wikipedia documents. We demonstrate that this model is useful for learning feature representations for nodes in the graph that are not assigned any data (i.e. for generalization to new categories). Additionally this model improves the specificity of feature representations for the nodes with observed data by explaining away more general features to parent nodes. Furthermore, we illustrate that this model is useful for understanding additional psychological aspects of concept representation, such as typicality ratings.",>Timothy Rubin>Matthew Zeigenfuze>Mark Steyvers,">Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine>Department of Psychology, Michigan State University>Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0394/index.html
2011,Making SNAP Judgments: Rethinking the Spatial Representation of Number,"Interactions between number and space, exemplified by the SNARC (Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes) effect, are often taken as evidence for a privileged spatial representation of number. Naturally, research on the spatial representation of number has typically focused on spatial tasks. But in order to make inferences about numerical cognition more generally, one must take care to tease apart spatial mental representation from spatial action. The present study asked participants to judge the relative magnitude of numbers, and to respond by producing sounds of different pitches. There was a significant interaction between pitch and number magnitude, analogous to the interaction between space and number: participants were faster to produce high pitches in response to high numbers. Moreover, the strength of this effect was unrelated to the strength of the traditional SNARC. We argue that these results undermine the privileged status of space as a representational substrate for number.",>Tyler Marghetis>Esther Walker>Benjamin Bergen>Rafael Núñez,">Department of Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego>Department of Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego>Department of Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego>Department of Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0395/index.html
2011,Latent Scope Bias in Categorization,"In naturalistic settings, it is sometimes ambiguous whether or not a particular exemplar exhibits various properties indicative of category membership. We show that individuals prefer to group exemplars into categories that have a narrower latent scope  categories that specify fewer unobserved features  to those with a broader scope. In Experiment 1, participants classified suspects with fewer unobserved features as more likely to have committed a crime. In Experiment 2, participants were more likely to categorize novel creatures as part of a group that had a narrower latent scope. Experiment 3 showed that participants were more willing to make inductions about unknown features based on a narrower latent scope categorization.",>Abigail B.

Mathematical education, however, favors mathematical models or algorithms without appeal to the axioms they depend on. Our series of studies demonstrate adult subjects inability to take advantage of the knowledge embodied in arithmetic axioms. It is likely that students ability to master generative proofs is related to the reliance on restrictive models. Our first set of studies focused on subjects ability to apply the addition-rule (mutually exclusive events) and the multiplication-rule (independent events) with multiple rational number representations (percentages, decimals, fractions, etc.). A second set of studies tested the understanding of group theory properties, exploiting the effect of the order of numbers (commutativity) and the effect of the digit zero (additive identity) on the long multiplication model (LMM). All studies conducted revealed participants ability to accurately perform arithmetic on chosen representation, but poor performance on choosing representation.",>Rony Patel>Jennifer Jacobs>Rochel Gelman,>Rutgers University>Rutgers University>Rutgers University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0399/index.html
2011,Learning by Drawing: drawing construction interacts with instructional support in fostering higher-order reasoning,"Learning by drawing involves learners construct an integrated verbal and nonverbal representation of the content to-be-learned. Despite considerable studies have investigated the effectiveness of drawing to support students comprehension of expository text, much remains unknown about drawing as a generative learning strategy. Specifically, successes of learning-by-drawing might be correlated with the complexity of the information to-be-learned. When content is challenging, learners may find it difficult to identify the main themes and select relevant elements to depict in their drawing. Prompts can thus be used as an instructional support to emphasize content that requires intentional processing. In this study, 86 fifth graders read a science text and were randomly assigned into three experimental conditions: drawing, drawing-with-prompts, and no-drawing. Participants retention and problem solving performance were measured. Participants in drawing-with-prompts condition outperformed their counterparts in retention and problem solving. Implications of the results on drawing and mental model construction were discussed.",>Margaret Chan,">Teachers College, Columbia University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0400/index.html
2011,Mind the Gap: Dispositional Agency Facilitates Toddlers Causal Representations,"Toddlers readily learn predictive relations between events (A predicts B); however, they intervene on A to cause B in few contexts (e.g., when an agent initiates the event.) The current studies look at whether toddlers failures are due to the difficulty of initiating interventions or to constraints on the events they causally represent. Toddlers saw a block slide towards a base, but an occluder prevented them from seeing whether the block contacted the base; after the block disappeared, a toy did or did not activate. We predicted if toddlers construed the events causally, then they would expect contact when the toy activated but distance when the toy did not activate. In Experiment 1 toddlers predicted the contact relations only when an agent was potentially present. Experiment 2 confirmed that toddlers believed a hidden agent was present. These findings suggest that dispositional agency facilitates toddlers ability to represent causal relationships.",>Paul Muentener>Elizabeth Bonawitz>Alexandra Horowitz>Laura Schulz,">Brain & Cognitive Sciences

We show that 6- and 7-year-olds number line estimates are recalibrated in response to the distribution of numbers being estimated, providing evidence for SM in these older children. We also find that 5-year-olds show improved estimation performance when given visual access to their previous estimates, suggesting that, while these youngest children do not use SM in some estimation tasks, they nonetheless understand the structural relationship between the count list and approximate magnitudes.",>Jessica Sullivan>David Barner,">Department of Psychology

Some of these models rely on distributional properties of words in large corpora, and have been contrasted with human performance on semantic similarity and priming in lexical decision tasks. Neural network models of lexical representation have been classically of reduced size due to computational limitations. Recently, associative memory models have been related to semantic space models such as LSA and Bayesian classificators. Our goal is to build lexical representations that include semantic and word-order information by using context-dependent neural networks. The model integrates word-order and semantic information in a way reminiscent of the BEAGLE model.

2011,The Moving Eye is Easy to Spy: How Motion Improves Gaze Discrimination,"When people move their eyes, their change in eye direction carries a motion signal. However, most research using gaze direction as a stimulus either controls or excludes the motion of the eyes. Here, we directly examined the role of motion in the discrimination of eye movements. Participants were shown two images: a person looking straight ahead and then looking to the left or right at 1, 2 or 3 degrees visual angle from fixation. This resulted in the apparent motion of the eyes to the left or right. In the no motion condition, participants received the two images separated by a 200 ms blank display, eliminating the perception of motion. Participants were more accurate and more confident of their judgements in the condition that included eye motion, but were also highly accurate without motion. These data indicate that eye motion can contribute to the computation of anothers gaze direction.",>Nicola Anderson>Evan Risko>Alan Kingstone,>University of British Columbia>Arizona State University>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0404/index.html
2011,Language and Space: Momentary Interactions,"Does language change thought? This classical question has recently received renewed attention, as new lines of evidence have been offered, either supporting or arguing against the idea that speaking a particular language-- or having a language at all-- affects our non-linguistic representation. The domain of space has provided particularly fertile territory for this debate. In this talk, I will present a new hypothesis about the way in which language interacts with visual-spatial representations, arguing that this occurs on a momentary basis, with no repercussions for permanent changes in our non-linguistic spatial representation. These momentary interactions increase over development, resulting in obligatory linguistic encoding in many tasks, but no real change in non-linguistic representations. This hypothesis not only accounts for new data I will discuss; it also accounts for much of the existing data on both sides of the aisle, in domains as different as spatial cognition and the representation of color. Having a language undoubtedly changes human cognition-- but it does not change our non-linguistic representations.",>Barbara Landau,">241 Krieger Hall

Humans, in addition, represent the world propositionally and conceptually (perspectivally), and they reason about it recursively and reflectively. The Shared Intentionality Hypothesis posits that these uniquely human forms of cognitive representation and reasoning emerged evolutionarily as cognitive adaptations for dealing with a distinctive form of social life, specifically, one in which individuals had to coordinate their intentional states with others in cooperative, and ultimately cultural, activities. Within these cooperative activities, early humans created shared realities (joint attention, common ground), which then enabled them to direct the attention and imagination of one another in relevant ways in acts of cooperative, and ultimately conventional, communication. Learning to cooperate and communicate within a cultural group during ontogeny creates uniquely human propositional-conceptual-reflective cognition.",>Michael Tomasello,">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology

This study attempted to tackle this by developing classification statistics and by exploring the dimensional organization of semantic space using models with different underlying metrics.

2011,The QWERTY Effect: How stereo-typing shapes the mental lexicon.,"The QWERTY keyboard mediates communication for millions of people. Here we investigated whether differences in the way words are typed correspond to differences in their meanings. Some words are spelled with more right-side keyboard letters, others with more left-side letters. We tested whether asymmetries in the way people interact with keys on the right and left of the keyboard influence their evaluations of the emotional valence of the words. In Experiment 1, we found a relationship between emotional valence and QWERTY key position, across three languages. Words with more right-hand letters were rated as more positive in meaning on average than words with more left-hand letters. In Experiment 2 we replicated this pattern in nonce words. Although these data are correlational, our results suggest that the QWERTY keyboard is shaping the meanings of words.

We extend this view by exploring a relation between pain and action inspired by Alva Noës theory of perception. We consider whether sensorimotor knowledge related to tissue damage plays a role in pain experience. We explore this possibility by considering various kinds of pain, including the pain of a thorn in ones foot, that of a herniated disk, and the chronic pain that sometimes follows the healing of an injury. We find that there is a large class of pain for which the phenomenal experience could easily be informed by sensorimotor knowledge in much the way Noë claims it is for vision and other forms of perception. We also find that conceiving of pain in this way inspires new understanding of phantom limb pain and chronic pain.",>Alice Kyburg,>University of Wisconsin Oshkosh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0409/index.html
2011,"Readiness-to-hand, extended cognition, and multifactality","A recent set of experiments of ours supported the notion of a transition in experience from readiness-to-hand to unreadiness-to-hand proposed by phenomenological philosopher Martin Heidegger. They were also an experimental demonstration of an extended cognitive system. We generated and then temporarily disrupted an interaction- dominant system that spans a human participant, a computer mouse, and a task performed on the computer screen. Our claim that this system was interaction dominant was based on the detection of 1/f noise at the hand-tool interface. The inference from the presence of 1/f noise to the presence of an interaction-dominant system is occasionally disputed. Increasing evidence suggests that inference from multifractality to interaction dominance is more certain than 1/f-like scaling alone. In this paper, we reanalyze the data using the wavelet transform modulus maxima method, showing that the human-mouse system displays multifractality. This reinforces our claims that the system is interaction dominant.",>Lin Nie>Dobromir Dotov>Anthony Chemero,">Department of Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs,CT>Department of Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT>Department of Psychology, Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster, PA",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0410/index.html

We propose a new strategy for learning causal direction when observing states of variables over time. When a cause changes state, its effects will likely change, but if an effect changes state due to an exogenous factor, its observed cause will likely stay the same. In two experiments, we found that people use this strategy to infer whether X→Y vs. X←Y, and X→Y→Z vs. X←Y→Z produced a set of data.

In the first experiment, we use a machine learning technique to automatically classify the blogs according to which group wrote them. We also examine the distinctive features that make these blogs liberal or conservative. In the second experiment, by examining posts in consecutive time blocks, we show that there was a significant increase over time in affective processing, and in anger, especially for conservatives.

2011,Creative Choices in Choreography: A New Qualitative Methodology,"A longitudinal cognitive ethnography of a dance company puts forward how rehearsals are made of social relationships of production (Kirsh et al, 2009). The choreographers creative choice is an individual act. In order to obtain new movements, he engages in an objectifying relationship with the dancer, which depends on the on the instructions degree of verbal information. Her body becomes an instrument for exploration of the choreographers imagery. But rehearsals are necessarily interactive. Our hypothesis is that the dancers patterns of creative choice compensate for the existing objectifying relationship. Social Network Analysis (centrality measures and simmelian ties) pictures them as distributed cognitive systems (Hollan et al, 2000). Interactions among dancers were frequent and mostly verbal, and included a surrogate figure, which acted as an information filter.

Using these model parameters, we focus on the differences between subjects with varying degrees of substance abuse and antisocial behavioral disorders and show that there are reliable differences between the decision mechanisms of these subjects. Using data from executive working memory tasks, we postulate that these differences in cognitive processes might be due to differences in working memory capacity.

2011,Probabilistic inferences under emotional stress,"Many models of cognition neglect emotional states that could affect individuals cognitive processes. The present study explores the effect of emotional stress on peoples cognitive processes when making probabilistic inferences. It was hypothesized that emotional stress reduces cognitive capacity, leading to the selection of simple inference strategies. Emotional stress was induced with highly arousing negative pictures briefly presented to participants before they made an inference. Emotional stress influenced the selectivity of participants information search. Emotionally stressed individuals relied on the importance of the cues to a greater extent than the nonstressed participants. They also spent less time on the least important information. Moreover, the proportion of participants choices consistent with a simple lexicographic heuristic was higher for the emotionally stressed participants than for the nonstressed participants. The results suggest that people respond adaptively to emotional stress by selecting heuristics that require less information and fewer cognitive operations.",>Szymon Wichary>Jörg Rieskamp,">Interdisciplinary Center for Applied Cognitive Studies

2011,Causal Explanations Guide Inferences about Childrens Bizarre Behaviors,"Lay people and experienced clinicians alike judge the abnormality of behaviors with reference to causal, explanatory events. However, different kinds of experience abound; for example, parents may encounter fewer exemplars than clinicians, but are experienced in reasoning about the real-world ramifications of childrens behaviors. When reasoning about child behaviors, parents may therefore be more attuned to societal views of abnormality and their effects than are non-parents. We presented parents and non-parents with child behaviors of ambiguous abnormality, followed by a congruent, incongruent, or no explanation. Non-parents judged behaviors with congruent explanations to be more normal, common, culturally acceptable, and adaptive than those with incongruent or no explanations. Parents also judged behaviors with congruent explanations to be more normal and common than those with incongruent or no explanations. However, parents judgments of cultural acceptability and adaptiveness were uninfluenced by explanations, reflecting their practical knowledge that explanations cannot change negative societal responses.",>Jennelle Yopchick>Nancy Kim,>Northeastern University>Northeastern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0418/index.html

2011,Visualizing Feedback: Using Graphical Cues to Promote Self-Regulated Learning,"We examined whether the addition of graphical cues on a concept map could promote self-regulated learning with online materials. College-aged students were provided with concept map visualizations to guide revisions of a scientific essay. These visualizations varied in their use of two graphical cues: color-coded nodes that indicated error types and size-scaled nodes that indicated the importance of domain ideas. Metacognitive strategies were assessed using students self-reported visualization use and essay changes. Learning was assessed via true/false items, short answer questions, and self-generated concept maps. Results indicated that color-coding promoted better revision strategies, and both graphical cues supported deeper understanding of domain content compared to a typical concept map display. Implications are discussed for visual display designs that provide meaningful feedback during online learning.",>Lisa Ferrara>Kirsten Butcher,>University of Utah>University of Utah,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0420/index.html
2011,Comparing A Brain-Based Account of Mind with Dual-Processing Theories,"This theoretical paper compares dual-processing theories (DPT) with a constructivist account of the mind (both knowing and learning). This account, termed reflection on activity-effect relationship, provides a single, multi-step model of processing situated within three functional systems in the human brain. Using well-known examples from DPT studies, two types of reflection (mental comparisons) and corresponding stages through which existing conceptions may be transformed into new onesare postulated to link conceptual learning with brain functioning. The central argument advanced here is that (a) distinguishing two frames of reference (observer, problem solver) and (b) articulating the solution process as well as the nature of problems (e.g., prompts), not only improves explanations of thinking taken-up by DPT, but also extends the range of issues addressed to cognitive change, which are germane to education.",>Ron Tzur,>University of Colorado Denver,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0421/index.html
2011,The spatially cued Go/NoGo in children. Brain activity analysis of the major inhibitory components.,"This study aimed to investigate cognitive inhibitory control using a spatially cued Go/NoGo task in combination with EEG. We measured reaction times and ERP components such as the LRP and the NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3 following Nogo trials and valid and invalid cues. Adults were significantly faster than children for all trial types suggesting a general improvement in cognitive abilities between childhood and adulthood. The LRPs were bigger in children suggesting stronger response preparation. Interestingly, a Nogo-P3 like effect was observed following invalid vs valid trials, whereas an opposite Nogo-N2 like effect was observed as Nogo-N2 amplitudes were larger following valid vs invalid trials. This indicates that different mechanisms are used to solve conflict in Go/Nogo trials and in Valid/Invalid trials. This is the first study to analyse the LRP following validly and invalidly cued stimuli in children and to examine Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 like effects following invalid and valid cues.",>Laura Vuillier>Denes Szucs>David Whitebread,">Departement of Experimental Psychology,University of Cambridge

By applying parameter tuning techniques, optimal fits of the model have been found against the (averaged) patterns of the skin conductance data.

2011,You Cant Play the Iowa Gambling Task with Mother Nature and Win,"The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was developed as a test of Damasios Somatic Marker Hypothesis, which hypothesizes that emotion plays a role in decision-making. The IGT is now widely used to assess the role of emotion in decision-making in clinical populations. However, although Damasios experimental results using the IGT were consistent with the Somatic Marker Hypothesis, there is no direct evidence indicating that the IGT measures the contribution of emotion to decision making in the IGT. Specifically, the IGT does not contain direct measures of emotion, it does not manipulate emotion, and it is not an obviously emotional task. There are only indirect implications that it does so because some clinical populations with emotional deficits have poor performance. We argue that further experimental work is needed to show whether or not IGT performance is systematically influenced by emotion.",>Courtney Humeny>Robert West,>Carleton University>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0424/index.html
2011,Emotional lexicon organization in memory,"In this article, we study the organization of emotions in memory supported by strategic processes. Three hypotheses are tested. First, if emotions are structured in a n-dimension space, to which emotional characteristics do these dimensions return. Second, is it possible to give an account of basic emotions through their organization in memory. Third, can semantic relations give an account of emotional relations. Two word sorting experiments are performed. In the first experiment, 128 pleasant and unpleasant words are divided into 8 lists. In the second experiment, one positive and one negative 128 words list are each divided into 8 groups of 16 words. The results support the hypothesis of an organization around a core affect (Russell, 2003), reinforce the existence of discrete emotions (Johnson-Laird & Oatley, 1989), and confirm the predictive function of semantic relations accounted by the Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer & Dumais, 1997) on the organization of emotions.",>Nicolas Leveau>Sandra Jhean-Larose>Guy Denhière,">CHArt - LUTIN - UMS CNRS 2809>Université d'Orléans

In the linguistic structure of Chinese, there are no legal consonant clusters occurred within each individual Chinese word, and this kind of phonotactics information of words may most likely cue native Chinese listeners the possible locations of word boundaries in the continuous Chinese speech. The results observed from the word-spotting experiment supported this prediction. Along with other relevant studies, we argue that phonotactics is one of the useful sources of information in the cognitive processes of spoken word recognition in Chinese.",>Michael C. W.

Students were required to match cue-target pairs and determine whether the 2 successive events represented features drawn from the same item. Both the perceptual/linguistic format and the modality of the cue influenced responses to pictures and environmental sounds, but the cue type effects were qualified by same/different response type and with picture targets by left or right presentation location. These results provide some additional evidence of processing asymmetry when pictures are directed to either the right or left hemisphere, as well as for some asymmetries in cross modal cueing.

2011,Cutting classes without scissors: conceptual primitives as a cognitive mechanism for idiom processing,"What does it tell us about the conceptual structures underlying language use that a language can use prick the law but not sing the law to mean break the law? Some theorists have speculated about the existence of conceptual primitives, which permeate the meaning of all words in any language (Schank, 1975, Mandler, 2004). If this premise is correct, then these concepts could also be used to decode metaphorical or idiomatic speech. The present research investigates whether people use the same concepts behind the literal verb meaning to infer the meaning of an idiomatic one. We investigated native-English speakers understanding of idioms in an unfamiliar language, i.e. Brazilian-Portuguese, and their understanding of fabricated idiomatic expressions that use words whose likely primitives conflict with the meaning of the idiom (e.g., sing the law to mean break the law). Results of this study reveal new insights for the theory of conceptual primitives.",>Juliana Gorian>Catherine Caldwell-Harris>Alia Biller,">Boston University

2011,The effects of regularity in spatial inferences with and without landmarks on spatial learning,"Spatial inferences during wayfindign could be closely related to spatial learning. We examined the effects of regularity in the inferences on learning of relative locations through wayfinding in the context of available information about an environment. In the experiment using a real maze, participants visited multiple targets in one of four conditions by a combination of two factors: an updating mode (regular or irregular) and an environmental information (with or without global landmarks). The results suggest that although the global landmarks facilitate the learning regardless of the updating modes, the difference in the regularity produces opposite effects depending on the landmark conditions. While the irregular updating, which involves multidirectional self-to-object updating, has a facilitation effect when the landmark information is available, it impedes the learning without the landmarks. The regular updating, which would allow a relatively easier wayfinding strategy facilitates the learning only in the latter condition.",>Kayoko Ohtsu>Yoshihiro Ouchi,">Graduate School of Education, Waseda University>Teikyo-Gakuen Junior College",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0429/index.html
2011,Quality of alternatives is related to abstract reasoning,"Conditional reasoning involves making inferences from a if p, then q major premise. Availability of alternative antecedents increases the probability of giving logical responses to invalid inferences with concrete premises (e.g., Cummins & al., 1991). With abstract premises, alternatives construction becomes cognitively complex. We hypothesized that the quality of alternatives produced in response to explicitly uncertain abstract inferences would be related to abstract reasoning performance. We asked 97 students to justify the response to uncertain AC inferences and to respond to abstract reasoning problems. Justifications were categorized by level of complexity of alternatives (specific, general, formal; Venet & Markovits, 2001). Participants were classed into high or low levels. Participants giving higher levels of justifications obtained better abstract reasoning scores (3.42) than participants with low levels (2.27) or controls who did not generate alternatives (2.26). The nature of cognitive possibilities (Byrne, 2005) thus seems critical in understanding abstract reasoning.",>Marie-Laurence Brunet>Hugues Lortie Forgues>Henry Markovits,>Université du Québec à Montréal>Université du Québec à Montréal>Université du Québec à Montréal,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0430/index.html
2011,"Resource depletion contributes to, but does not cause, the attentional blink","Contemporary debates concerning the attentional blink (AB) question whether resource depletion causes this robust attentional deficit. To investigate this uncertainty, we employed rapid serial visual presentation paradigms that presented stimuli at 30-120msec/item. In addition to the two targets of interest, a third target was positioned immediately before the second target on three-target trials. Two-target trials, which were less resource intensive that the three-target trials, were also included. Interestingly, target accuracy was significantly improved on the three-target trials compared with the two-target trials. Consequently, resource depletion cannot explain the AB because the deficit was alleviated when target detection resources were strained. However, we employed novel conditional accuracy analyses to show that, on three-target trials, the second target was better detected when the additional third target was not detected. Therefore, although resource depletion cannot explain the AB deficit on a global level, resources play an important role on the local level.",>Hannah Pincham>Denes Szucs,>University of Cambridge>University of Cambridge,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0431/index.html
2011,Word Up! Directed motor action improves word learning.,"Can simple motor actions help people expand their vocabulary? Here we show that word learning depends on where students place their flash cards after studying them. In Experiment 1, participants learned the definitions of ""alien words"" with positive or negative emotional valence. After studying each card, they placed it in one of two boxes (top or bottom), according to its valence. Participants who were instructed to place positive cards in the top box, consistent with Good is Up metaphors, scored about 10% better on a vocabulary test than those who placed them in the bottom box. Participants who placed all cards on the desktop scored in between the good-is-up and good-is-down groups. Experiments 2 and 3 extended this technique to words with no strong emotional valence. Experiment 4 showed that simply thinking or saying up/down was ineffective: directed motor action is critical to the Word-Up effect.",>Daniel Casasanto>Angela de Bruin,">MPI for Psycholinguistics;

This linkage was examined across all limbs. In two experiments participants moved two limbs at maximal speed the same target distance (28 cm) while one limb negotiated a 20 cm vertical barrier. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the effects of a barrier hand on a non-barrier hand and the effects of a barrier foot on a non-barrier foot produced a similar pattern of results on movement time, peak velocity, time to peak, and peak height. Experiment 2 demonstrated that a barrier foot had greater impact on a non-barrier hand compared to the influence of a barrier hand on a non-barrier foot across dependent variables. This hierarchical relationship, where foot-control is weakly linked to hand-control but hand-control is strongly linked to foot-control, is cogent with the decoupling hypothesis for the origin of hominin bipedalism (Sylvester, 2006).",>Robert Kohl>Raymond McCoy>Kimberly Mount,">Department of Kinesiology and Health Sciences, The College of William and Mary>Department of Kinesiology and Health Sciences, The College of William and Mary>Department of Kinesiology and Health Sciences, The College of William and Mary",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0433/index.html
2011,Prompting Effective Collaboration Using Deep Questions,"The use of visuals (e.g., videos, animations) to promote learning has been of great interest to researchers and educators. A key challenge is to determine the extent to which cognitively-based, instructional supports (e.g., prompts, feedback) can promote deeper understanding when students learn with visual materials. In this research, we explored the effects of deep vs. shallow questions on individuals or dyads studying online, instructional videos on Internet safety. Prior to viewing videos, learners studied deep-level (explanation-based) and shallow-level (knowledge-telling) questions. We hypothesized that dyads would benefit more from deep questions, since collaborative pairs provide greater opportunities for constructive knowledge building. Assessments included measures of recall and knowledge transfer/application. Results demonstrated that deep-level questions promoted better understanding of video content when students studied collaboratively, but did not impact individual performance. Thus, deep-level questions can serve as an effective method to support collaborative learning in terms of new knowledge construction and transfer.",>Robert Zheng>Kirsten Butcher>Udita Gupta>Paul Callister,>University of Utah>University of Utah>University of Utah>University of Utah,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0434/index.html
2011,Storing objects in visual short-term memory: Location is key,"There are two views that describe the capacity of visual short-term memory (VSTM): one that posits that capacity has a strict upper limit, and the other that states that capacity has no fixed upper limit. Here we attempt to reconcile these views by measuring capacity of VSTM in two experiments where the number of objects (cubes) and the number of features (colors) in an object were varied independently. In the first experiment, we used a single probe at the center of the screen, and found that the total number of features determined accuracy. In the second, we used a whole-display match-to-sample paradigm, and observed that the total number of objects determined accuracy. These findings suggest that VSTM uses a spatially located binding mechanism whose benefit is lost when the probe and target locations differ. We are currently running new experiments to test this hypothesis more stringently.",>Shriradha Sengupta>Paul Michel Bernard Verhaeghen>Patricia Mary Hearons,>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology>Georgia Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0435/index.html

Such estimates have no right or wrong answers, but when they suffice to determine the joint probability distribution, they should at least be consistent, yielding one that sums to unity. Mental model theory predicts two main sources of inconsistency: the need to estimate the probabilities that events do not happen, and the need to estimate conditional probabilities as opposed, say, to conjunctive probabilities. Experiments 1 and 2 corroborated the first prediction: when the number of estimates of non-events increased for a problem, so did the degree of overall inconsistency. Experiment 3 corroborated the second prediction: when the number of estimates of conditional probabilities increased, the degree of overall inconsistency was larger as well.",>Sangeet Khemlani>Max Lotstein>Phil Johnson-Laird,>Princeton University>Princeton University>Princeton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0436/index.html

In other games, infinitely iterated reasoning ultimately prescribes random play. In an online experiment of strategic thinking in groups, we tested participants in a game with the formal structure of a random game, but the superficial structure of a game that rewards iterated reasoning. We found that participants conformed to the superficial structure of the game, and earned more than they would have by playing randomly. We estimated how many steps participants thought ahead in the game and matched it to previous findings in iterated reasoning. We also discovered implicit coordination at the group level.

Results show that people use both priors and likelihoods in Bayesian directions, but the effect of likelihood information is stronger than that of prior information. Use of frequency information and surprisal measures increase deviations from Bayesian predictions.

After each game, the participants rated their own and the groups performance.

We present two experiments investigating how cross-situational word learning (CSWL) and learning based on sentence-level constraints (SLCL) interact. Our results reveal that SLCL reduces the impact of CSWL when cues are in conflict (Experiment 1) and even blocks statistical sensitivity when cues are independently applicable (Experiment 2). We suggest that the probabilistic nature of CSWL and the more deterministic cues offered by SLCL may underlie this behavior.",>Judith Koehne>Matthew W.

However, in the study presented herein, we were able to induce a similar log-to-linear shift on number line estimation tasks among adults by manipulating their familiarity with the numbers we used as stimuli. We offer this evidence as an existence proof that differences in performance on number line estimation tasks may not necessarily be indicative of fundamental differences in the formats of peoples underlying numerical magnitude representations. Rather, they may be diagnostic of differences in peoples understandings of what magnitudes are represented by symbolic numbers.",>Percival Matthews>Dana Chesney,>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0441/index.html

2011,Does anchoring cause overconfidence only in experts?,"The anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) predicts elicitation of an initial estimate will prompt subsequent minimum and maximum estimates to lie close to the initial estimate, resulting in narrow ranges and overconfidence. Evidence for this, however, is mixed; while Heywood-Smith, Welsh & Begg (2008) observed narrower subsequent ranges, Block and Harper (1991) report ranges became wider. One suggestion has been that this reflects a difference between expert and novice reactions to elicitation tasks. The present study investigated whether the interplay between expertise and number preferences leads to the paradoxical effects of an initial estimate. Participants with high expertise make precise estimates whereas participants with less expertise prefer rounded numbers, which could, potentially, reduce the impact of anchors. We confirm that expertise affects the precision of estimates and observe results indicative of the theorized effect  an interaction between expertise and elicitation method on range widths.",>Belinda Bruza>Matthew Welsh>Daniel Navarro>Steve Begg,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0443/index.html

Sporer (2001) suggests that other-race faces may activate a categorization response, which may divert ones attention away and in turn hurt the recognition of these faces (in-group/out-group model). In the current study, we manipulated in/out group and attentional resource as independent variables to verify their influence on the own-race effect. We found that in the high attention condition, only in-group with other race participants, not out-group with other race participants showed the own-race effect. But in the low attention group, the own-race effect occurred only for out-group with other race participants, not for in-group with other race participants.

However, much evidence suggests that people prefer simple causal explanations, and discount one causal explanation when another is salient. This led us to ask when and how people integrate causal alternatives. We presented causal reasons for changes in statistics (e.g., traffic fatalities) that were either directly relevant or irrelevant to an action, and asked participants how willing they were to take each action. By presenting two causal reasons in counterbalanced order, we were able to consider the extent to which participants integrated causes in their action decision.

We designed an alternative task that lessens performance demands, The Birthday task, to more directly evaluate childrens cardinality knowledge. Subjects are told a childs age and given a sticker to place on the corresponding cake. Subjects were given both the Give-X and Birthday tasks. 30 children were classified as subset-knowers, as determined by criteria identical to LeCorre et al.

However, little is known about whether young children attribute mental states for non-human agents similar to those for human agents. Forty-five young children aged 5 and 6 years old participated. Two types of standard false belief tasks were prepared. The only difference of the two tasks was the agent: human or robot. Stories were presented as animations. The results showed that most participants correctly answered the control questions in both tasks. However, for the belief questions, the percentage of the correct answers in the task of human agents was higher than that in the task of non-human agents. These results demonstrate that young children ages 5 or 6 are already sensitive to mental states of human agents, but not to non-human agents.",>Hajimu Hayashi,>Okayama University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0447/index.html

Students hypothesis generation in biology was compared while they used: (1) non-digital paper and pencil tools, (2) a digital paper and pen interface, (3) pen tablet interface, and (4) keyboard-based graphical tablet interface with a supplementary pen. Results showed that students expressed 44% more nonlinguistic representational content (diagrams, symbols, numbers, marking) when using pen interfaces. They simultaneously generated 36% more appropriate science hypotheses. Furthermore, knowledge of nonlinguistic communication predicted 72% of the variance in their idea generation. In contrast, the keyboard-based graphical interface primed 36% more linguistic input, which suppressed ideation. Results are interpreted in the context of Affordance and Activity Theories. In summary, basic computer input capabilities can substantially facilitate or impede ideation in science.",>Sharon Oviatt>Adrienne Cohen>Ariana Mann,>Incaa Designs>Duke University>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0449/index.html
2011,Evading a Multitasking Bottleneck: Presenting Intermediate Representations in the Environment,"When people have to store intermediate results for multiple tasks concurrently, performance decreases considerably as opposed to when at most one intermediate result has to be stored. Borst, Taatgen and Van Rijn (2010) have shown that a multitasking bottleneck associated with intermediate problem representations can account for this effect. This study investigates whether representing problem representations externally reduces the interference. To this end we extended the experiment in Borst et al. (2010) with a version that required no problem representation. The results show that there is an over-additive increase in response times when both tasks need to store an intermediate representation, as compared to a situation in which at most one task requires an intermediate representation, either because no intermediate representation is needed, or because the intermediate representation is available on the screen. These results suggest that multitasking performance can be improved by presenting intermediate representations in the environment.",>Trudy Buwalda>Jelmer Borst>Niels Taatgen>Hedderik van Rijn,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0450/index.html
2011,Gestures are Produced During Spatial Tasks,"Previous research has shown that speakers gesture more when describing imagistic information than when describing non-imagistic information. One explanation for this finding is that spatial information is more difficult to describe verbally than non-spatial information. In the present study, we designed two novel tasks, one verbal and one spatial, in which difficulty and spatiality were not confounded. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that the spatial task is actually less difficult and leads to fewer errors than the verbal task. In Experiment 2, we found that speakers produced more representational gestures on the spatial task than the verbal task, even though it was not more difficult. Results suggest that speakers do not gesture on spatial tasks simply because they are more difficult.",>Autumn Hostetter>Erin Sullivan,>Kalamazoo College>Kalamazoo College,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0451/index.html
2011,Modeling Decision Making on the Use of Automation,"This paper presents a cognitive model that simulates reliance on automation using a line-tracing task similar to driving where an operator has to track a moving line with a circle by pressing keys on a keyboard (manual control) or rely on automation (auto control). An operator can switch between auto and manual control during the task. The success proba- bilities of each control mode were systematically varied. An ACT-R model to perform this task was constructed by repre- senting reliance on the automation as production. The model performs this task through productions that manage the per- ceptual/motor modules. The utility values of these productions are updated based on the rewards in every screen update. We also introduce a meta-level monitoring the internal state of the model. A preliminary run of this model simulated the overall trends of the behavioral data, suggesting some validity of the assumptions made in our model.",>Junya Morita>Kazuhisa Miwa>Akihiro Maehigashi>Hitoshi Terai>Kazuaki Kojima>Frank Ritter,>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Nagoya University>Waseda University>Pennsylvania State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0452/index.html

We conducted two experiments using two types of tracking tasks. As a result, we found that people tended to perform effort control based on manual-based selection, depending more on manual performance than system performance. Also, we confirmed that the tendency to use an automation system was related to the selection strategy.",>Akihiro Maehigashi>Kazuhisa Miwa>Hitoshi Terai>Kazuaki Kojima>Junya Morita,">Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University>Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University>Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University>Faculty of Human Sciences, Waseda University>School of Knowledge Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0453/index.html
2011,Robot gaze does not reflexively cue human attention,"Joint visual attention is a critical aspect of typical human interactions. Psychophysics experiments indicate that people exhibit strong reflexive attention shifts in the direction of another person's gaze, but not in the direction of non-social cues such as arrows. In this experiment, we ask whether robot gaze elicits the same reflexive cueing effect as human gaze. We consider two robots, Zeno and Keepon, to establish whether differences in cueing depend on level of robot anthropomorphism. Using psychophysics methods for measuring attention by analyzing time to identification of a visual probe, we compare attention shifts elicited by five directional stimuli: a photograph of a human face, a line drawing of a human face, Zeno's gaze, Keepon's gaze and an arrow. Results indicate that all stimuli convey directional information, but that robots fail to elicit attentional cueing effects that are evoked by non-robot stimuli, regardless of robot anthropomorphism.",>Henny Admoni>Caroline Bank>Joshua Tan>Mariya Toneva>Brian Scassellati,>Yale University>Yale University>Yale University>Yale University>Yale University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0454/index.html
2011,Developing Natural Full-body Motion Synthesis in Virtual Humans,"Everyday action sequences such as taking a few steps to point at an object are trivial for humans because they require minimal effort. However, such actions pose serious challenges to developing realistic animated virtual humans that autonomously interact with people in training and educational applications. We propose a framework targets data-driven full-body motion synthesis for virtual humans. Motions captured from human actions (e.g., walk and point) allow us to create behavioral models and build generic motion databases containing upper-body and walking actions. Synthesis output is achieved by parameterizing motion databases with behavior models. We augment our current inverse-blending action model and stepping planner by targeting environment configuration factors, including character gaze (e.g., timing, frequency, fixation points), body position (e.g., bending, preferred location to start action), and walk-action coordination (e.g., temporal dynamics). To further inform the development of realistic virtual humans, user studies validate the model and assist in fine-tuning.",>Yazhou Huang>Justin L.

2011,Perception of intentions and mental states in autonomous virtual agents,"Comprehension of goal-directed, intentional motion is an important but understudied visual function. To study it, we created a two-dimensional virtual environment populated by independently-programmed autonomous virtual agents, which navigate the environment, collecting food and competing with one another. Their behavior is modulated by a small number of distinct ""mental states"": exploring, gathering food, attacking, and fleeing. In two experiments, we studied subjects' ability to detect and classify the agents' continually changing mental states on the basis of their motions and interactions. Our analyses compared subjects' classifications to the ground truth state occupied by the observed agent's autonomous program. Although the true mental state is inherently hidden and must be inferred, subjects showed both high validity (correlation with ground truth) and high reliability (correlation with one another). The data provide intriguing evidence about the factors that influence estimates of mental state---a key step towards a true ""psychophysics of intention.""",>Peter C. Pantelis>Steven A.

2011,Moving Toward the Right Statement: Effects of Grounded Embodied Cognition on Computational Thinking,"A grounded embodied approach to the instruction of computational abstractions provides concrete representations for characteristically abstract symbols. If the perceptual symbols that comprise a pre-defined scenario are fundamentally grounded in human behavior (e.g. walking), does the mere act of embodiment influence how these behaviors are represented in a computational artifact? Prior research has demonstrated that an embodied approach to the instruction of computer programming results in artifacts that implement more complex code structures. The current study examines how grounded embodied cognition influences the representation of movement in computational artifacts. Using the Instructional Embodiment (Fadjo et al., 2010) framework, participants engaged in learning activities through physical and imagined embodiment (Direct Embodiment with Explicit Imagination) or imagined embodiment without physical enactment (No Embodiment with Explicit Imagination). Findings suggest that physical enactment with explicit imagination during learning results in control abstractions that represent movement with greater precision than imagination alone.",>Cameron L.

Students in the full external visual representation conditions performed significantly better than the control-text and partial external visual representation conditions on questions of free recall but significantly higher on multiple choice and drawing questions than the control-text group only. This evidence suggests providing complete visual external representations is most beneficial to students for reconstructing and manipulating a mental model of the abstract system without being given any hints or clues from external sources like question stems but also more beneficial than traditional textbook methods for answering standard multiple choice questions.",>Satyugjit Virk>John Black,">Teacher's College, Columbia University>Teacher's College, Columbia University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0458/index.html
2011,Comparing the efficacy of bigrams and frames in cuing lexical categories for human learners,"Distributional patterns in linear word sequences are informative about lexical categories in natural languages. However, it is unclear what patterns human learners use to categorize words. The current study exposed adults to sentences in two artificial languages. The Frames group heard sentences in which target words were embedded in frequent frames (FFs)frequently co-occurring words that immediately surrounded/framed a target word (e.g., you_X_it); the FFs categorized the target words into two distinct categories. The Bigrams-Only group heard sentences with the same vocabulary, but no FFs. However, the bigram information in the two languages was equally informative regarding the categories of target words. In a 2AFC test, Frames subjects but not the Bigrams-Only subjects chose novel sentences that contained target words as correct if they adhered to the abstract distributional structure, compared to ungrammatical sentences that were identical on all surface dimensions. Thus, learners categorized using FFs but not bigrams alone.",>Toben Mintz,>University of Southern California,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0459/index.html
2011,Differential Weighting of Perceptual and Linguistic Factors Predicts English Noun Age-of-Acquisition,"Age of acquisition (AoA) is a psycholinguistic variable that may prove useful toward gauging the relative weighting of phonological, semantic, and morphological factors at different phases of language acquisition. We examined a large corpus of English nouns using AoA as the outcome variable in three multivariate regressions, encompassing different age ranges (early-middle-late). Predictors included perceptual (e.g., imagery), phonological (e.g., phonological neighborhood density), and lexical (e.g., word length) factors. Different combinations of predictors accounted for significant proportions of the variance for different AoA ranges. For example, imageability and frequency are stronger predictors of early relative to late word-learning. Corpus analyses support a hybrid model of word-learning in which children differentially weight perceptual and linguistic factors over time. This statistical approach may provide independent corroboration of experimental studies in language learning.",>Christopher H. Ramey>Evangelia G.

The nature of this development is investigated through the application of a formal model to categorization decisions by children aged 7-13 years and adults. Children up till the age of 13 overextend categories. It is established that these overextensions are not due to differences in the manner in which children and adults organize items with respect to the target categories. Even the youngest children appear to know about the internal category organization that informs categorization. Rather, the overextensions are the results of children imposing too tolerant a criterion for category membership on this organization. With age children learn of this discrepancy and gradually reduce it to converge upon the conventional adult meaning.",>Steven Verheyen>Eef Ameel>Gert Storms,>University of Leuven>University of Leuven>University of Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0461/index.html

In this paper, we present an algorithm for word extraction that works directly from naturalistic acoustic input: infant-directed speech from the CHILDES corpus. The algorithm identifies recurring acoustic patterns that are candidates for identification as words or phrases, and then clusters together the most similar patterns. The recurring patterns are found in a single pass through the corpus using an incremental method, where only a small number of utterances are considered at once. Despite this limitation, we show that the algorithm is able to extract a number of recurring words, including some that infants learn earliest, such as ""Mommy"" and the child's name.

Here we used two comprehension tasks to further evaluate the nature of later lexical learning. In a name applicability task, seven- to 13-year old Dutch-speaking children judged whether each of three names applied to common household containers. In a typicality judgment task, participants judged how good an example the containers were of the three names. Both tasks revealed continued evolution of word use up to age 13. However, all names were overextended by the children, in contrast to the production data in which both over- and underextension were found. Moreover, the child lexical categories showed considerable overlap, indicating strong inter-category relatedness. With age these overextensions as well as the overlap gradually disappeared and the lexical categories became more distinct over time.",>Eef Ameel>Barbara Malt>Gert Storms,">University of Leuven, Belgium>Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA>University of Leuven, Belgium",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0464/index.html
2011,Generalizing between form and meaning using learned verb classes,"Early language development critically depends on the ability to form abstract representations of linguistic knowledge, and to generalize that knowledge to new situations. In verb knowledge, much generalization appears to be driven by various regularities between form and meaning, but it is difficult to assess how these factors interact in a complex learning environment. We extend a hierarchical Bayesian model to acquire abstract knowledge of verbs from naturalistic child-directed speech, then generalize these abstractions to novel verbs, simulating child behaviour. We use the syntactic alternation structure of a novel verb to infer aspects of its meaning, and use the meaning of a novel verb to predict its range of acceptable syntactic forms. The model provides a useful framework to investigate the interaction of complex factors in verb learning.",>Christopher Parisien>Suzanne Stevenson,>University of Toronto>University of Toronto,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0465/index.html

2011,Using a Speakers Eye-Gaze in Conversation: Benefits and Costs,"Eyegaze is a powerful source of information in face-to-face conversation. Our previous work showed addressees can use this information rapidly and flexibly, speeding referential disambiguation when the speaker was clearly looking at a target object versus a similar competitor. However, monitoring eyegaze demands attentional resources which may also have costs during collaborative tasks. Since the most reliable indication of gaze direction comes from looking near a speaker's eyes, but people can also judge less precise head orientation more peripherally (e.g., Loomis et al., 2008), we compared addressees' ability to disambiguate instructions to pick up objects when a speaker's eyes were visible or were obscured by mirrored sunglasses, compared to a baseline where the speaker was completely hidden. We present analyses of addressees' eye movements which reveal the extent to which they benefit from attending to and coordinating the use of the speaker's disambiguating eye versus head movements during language comprehension.",>Joy Hanna>Susan Brennan,>Oberlin College>Stony Brook University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0467/index.html

Negation provides additional context, whereby visualizing negation as a trajectory in a distributed, grounded perceptual simulation space can easily characterize the comprehension of negated sentences.

Emergent features are metaphoric interpretations that are characteristic neither of the target nor the vehicle. In the first experiment, participants were asked to respond as to whether a verbal feature is an appropriate interpretation of the metaphor, which was presented as a prime. They are asked to respond immediately after a tone is presented which has a variable temporal lag after the feature. The timing of each tone controlled the participants' response times. The results show that the response deadline given to the participants only slightly affected their judgments. In a second experiment, the time to interpret a metaphor was controlled by varying the presentation time of the metaphor. The results showed that emergent features require more time for recognition as a metaphoric interpretation than do non-emergent features. The results support the hypothesis that interaction among features causes feature emergence.",>Asuka Terai>Robert Goldstone,>Tokyo Institute of Technology>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0469/index.html

Here, we present an experiment that investigates the extent to which listeners learn situation-specific adjustments in the information and/or weight of the lexical bias of a verb.

However, some scholars have suggested that performance outcomes result from an interaction between individual differences (IDs), such as WMC, and learning conditions (Robinson, 2005a). Reber, Walkenfeld, and Hernstadt (1991) specifically claimed that IDs influence performance on explicit, but not implicit, processes. In this study, English native-speakers were exposed to a semi-artificial language under incidental or rule-search conditions, and their WMC was measured by two complex-span tasks. Both conditions produced a clear learning effect, with an advantage for the rule-search group. No significant correlations between overall performance on a grammaticality judgment task and WM scores were found for either group. However, WMC predicted performance on grammatical items for the rule-search group.

We examine whether alignment will also improve learning in a classroom context. Our study examines 3rd-6th graders ability to learn an engineering concept (the stability of triangles) when the lesson uses spatial alignment and when it does not. In the aligned condition, we introduce a triangle, a braced square (consists of two triangles) and a truss (consists of multiple triangles) and spatially align them with one another. In the unaligned condition, we introduce these same components separately, with no spatial alignment. Students are given a pretest before the lesson and a post-test after the lesson, both of which assessed knowledge of the stability of triangles. Preliminary results indicate that students learn more in the aligned condition, suggesting that alignment is an important learning tool, even in less controlled settings such as a classroom.",>Lauren Applebaum>Elizabet Spaepen>Dedre Gentner>Susan C.

This study investigated whether childrens difficulties are due, in part, to incorrectly encoding (internally representing) the equivalence problems and tested whether improvements in encoding would lead to improvements in problem solving. To address these issues, we developed a new measure of problem encoding that used a change detection paradigm, and we also utilized more traditional reconstruction and recognition measures. Children completed measures of encoding and problem solving before and after a brief lesson designed to improve their encoding. Change detection performance was significantly correlated with performance on the traditional encoding measures. Moreover, all three encoding measures were related to childrens pretest problem-solving performance. Finally, pre- to posttest changes in childrens encoding appeared to be related to changes in childrens problem-solving performance. These findings suggest that improving problem encoding should be a target of instruction about equations.",>Noelle M. Crooks>Martha W.

In a follow-up classroom study, we examined whether students generally selected the better format (i.e., faster problem solving with better understanding of materials; distributed format in this study) when given the choice and whether individual differences affect students instruction format preferences.

2011,Modeling information sampling over the course of learning,"There is growing evidence that self-directed learning--in which a person chooses what information to experience--is more successful than passive learning across a range of tasks. One explanation for this advantage is that self-directed learners focus on information that is useful for reducing their uncertainty. However, the process by which uncertainty leads to sampling decisions is unclear. While previous work has focused on supporting a single normative model of sampling, we present evidence that such decisions reflect evolving demands over the course of learning. As participants learned to differentiate perceptual categories we measured their uncertainty in how to classify items they sampled, and find distinct shifts in the type of information they choose to collect as learning progresses. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating models of rational information acquisition (and claims of confirmation bias) in the context of sequentially extended, self-directed learning tasks.",>Doug Markant>Todd Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0477/index.html
2011,The Sensory-Dependent Nature of Audio-Visual Interactions for Semantic Knowledge,"The nature of audio-visual interactions is poorly understood for meaningful objects. These interactions would be indirect through semantic memory according to the amodal nature of knowledge, whereas these interactions would be direct according to the modal nature of knowledge. This question, central for both memory and multisensory frameworks, was assessed using a cross-modal priming paradigm from auditory to visual modalities tested on familiar objects. For half of the sound primes, a visual abstract mask was simultaneously presented to the participants. The results showed a cross-modal priming effect for semantically congruent objects compared to semantically incongruent objects presented without the mask. The mask interfered in the semantically congruent condition, but had no effect in the semantically incongruent condition. The semantic specificity of the mask effect demonstrates a memory-related effect. The results suggest that audio-visual interactions are direct. The data support the modal approach of knowledge and the grounded cognition theory.",>Guillaume Vallet>Benoit Riou>Rémy Versace>Martine Simard,">Université Lumière Lyon 2. Laboratoire EMC (France) &

This study investigated the link between second-order relational structure and the face inversion effect suggested by Diamond and Carey (1986). The idea is that expertise gained as a consequence of a great deal of experience with exemplars derived from a familiar category, that possess what Diamond and Carey term second order relational structure, can produce an improved ability to distinguish between and recognise members of this category, which is lost on inversion. In this paper we report two experiments that confirm that we can obtain a strong face inversion effect, and that the magnitude of this effect can be reduced by disrupting the second order relational structure of the faces.",>Ciro Civile>R.P.

2011,Dynamics of Neuropsychological Testing,"How should we analyze repeated trials in neuropsychological testing? It has long been known that experimental subjects display distinct stages of acclimatization and subsequent saturation during cognitive testing (Thurstone, 1927). For example, in list learning tests examining memory, it has been demonstrated that repeated exposure to a fixed enumeration of items can improve recall. However, we think it is equally important to examine acclimatization of the subjects to the test taking procedure itself.

2011,Relationship Between Episodic Memory Formation and Two Minds,"This paper presents evidence that even if two individuals exhibit similar reactions caused by their autonomous nervous systems towards the same external stimuli, one may form a memory that can be recalled consciously, whereas the other may form a memory that cannot be processed consciously. We had fifteen monitors watch films, and we recorded their heart rates. Two monitors exhibited similar autonomous nervous system reactions, measured by HR, to the same films. We conducted interviews and compared their episodic memory about the films that both watched. One monitor was able to verbalize in detail her behavior, whereas the other could recall little of what he had watched. We suggest that this phenomenon can be explained by assuming that for the two monitors System1 of Two Minds worked similarly to external stimuli, whereas System2 worked differently for each monitor, affecting the formation of episodic memory in terms of conscious recallability.",>Muneo Kitajima>Makoto Toyota>Kohzoh Yoshino>Sayaka Matsumoto>Hirotsugu Tahira>Ryohei Miyaji,>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology>T-Method>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology>National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology>U'eyes Design Inc.>U'eyes Design Inc.,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0481/index.html
2011,A Model of Working Memory in Schizophrenia,"Working memory deficits in schizophrenia are key cognitive features of the disorder and have been demonstrated to involve a circuit of brain regions. Here we model this circuitry with a connectionist model representing 3 key processing areas of the circuitry: anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and parietal cortex. The model adapts to a stream of unique inputs and responds when it detects novel matches to either a set target or previously-viewed items held in memory, depending on the working memory load. We show how ACG and DLPFC are involved in maintenance and novelty detection using working memory, and relate the dysfunction of these areas in schizophrenia to the operation of the model. The model demonstrates how the impairment of both response selection and working memory maintenance can affect performance and how brain imaging may help to identify the dissociable impairment predicted by the model.",>Brandon Abbs,">Harvard Medical School, Department of Psychiatry

2011,Learning and generalizing sameness in simple recurrent networks,"I study the ability of simple recurrent networks to learn and generalize sameness. To this end, I trained 100 networks to output 1 if two successive real valued vectors in a sequence were similar and 0 otherwise. Although learning of the training set proceeded easily, we could not make any of the networks generalize beyond the training set, despite the test vectors being within the training space. In an attempt to understand these limitations I studied networks of threshold units. In the first place I analyzed networks able to process sequences of bits. I show that part of the problems arise because, depending on the training set, there might be cases were not every accessible internal state of the network is visited, leaving those cases out of the training space. The case of multidimensional inputs is even more difficult given that the networks get trapped in wrong generalizations.",>Juan Valle-Lisboa,">Secccion Biofisica, Facultad de Ciencias, UDELAR, URUGUAY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0483/index.html
2011,Bridging the gap between brain and behavior: A dynamic neural field model of executive function captures behavioral and neural development,"The Dimensional Change Card Sort task measures the development of executive function. Children must switch from sorting cards based on shape or color to sorting by the other dimension. While 4-year-olds can switch rules, 3-year-olds perseverate. Moriguchi and Hiraki (2009) used Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure changes in PFC activation (F7/F8) in this task: 3- and 5-year-olds who switched rules showed stronger prefrontal activation than perseverators. Here, we quantitatively capture these results using a Dynamic Neural Field model. This model was developed to simulate an extensive set of behavioral findings with 3- and 4-year-olds. From the model, we can estimate local field potentials (LFPs) which underlie the BOLD response (Deco et al, 2004). We show that the model yields the same association of PFC activation and correct rule-switching when we convolve the model-based LFP with an impulse response function. Thus, the model simultaneously captures behavioral and neural development.",>John Spencer>Aaron Buss,">Department of Psychology

College students participated in a task which required them to trace or draw various forms of a figure-8 before completing a battery of cognitive tests. Three distinct drawing strategies emerged, and the tendency to vary these strategies was quantified using Shannons Entropy. The results indicated that participants employed multiple strategies early in a block of trials before eventually settling on a preferred strategy. Additionally, higher creativity scores were associated with higher entropy, whereas participants with higher verbal and working memory ability preferred to settle on their preferred strategy.",>Brent Morgan>Sidney D'Mello>Jenna Fielding>Karl Fike>Andrea Tamplin>Gabe Radvansky>James Arnett>Robert Abbott>Arthur Graesser,>University of Memphis>University of Memphis>University of Memphis>University of Memphis>University of Notre Dame>University of Notre Dame>University of Memphis>Sandia National Labs>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0485/index.html

The current studies examined the effects of brief periods of meditation on the academic performance of students at California State University, Northridge. Participants from four different psychology classes (three lower division and one upper division class) randomly received either brief meditation training or rest, followed by a traditional class lecture that ended with a quiz on that same lecture material. Results from the three lower-division classes all indicated that meditation improved quiz performance, but quiz scores in the upper-division class were unchanged following meditation.

2011,An own-age bias in age estimation of faces.,"The occurrence of an own-age bias on age estimation of faces was assessed by comparing children (10-14), young (20-30) and older (65-75) adults performances. Participants from each age group estimated both in-group and out-group faces. Overall, the age of childrens faces was more accurately estimated than the age of both young and older adult faces. Moreover, the age of young adult faces was more accurately estimated than that of older adults. A significant Age of participants X Age of face stimuli interaction was revealed. Although we did not observe a crossed interaction where each age group would have been more accurate for in-group estimation than for out-group estimation, present results reveal the occurrence of an own-age bias in age estimation. There was no significant difference between the three groups when estimating child faces, but young and older adults were more accurate for in-group estimation than the other groups of participants.",>Evelyne Moyse>Serge Brédart,>University of Liège>University of Liège,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0487/index.html

The goal was to use the parameter values derived from clustering judgments for the eye data analysis of a radar choice task. A validation study was also conducted to determine whether the clustering judgments made by participants using a web-based interface are comparable to judgments made by participants who did a paper-based version of the task and therefore had the more intuitive task of circling the visual clusters.

2011,Strategies for tone identification in observers with absolute pitch,"Behavioral studies have shown that observers with absolute pitch tend to perform very proficiently in a range of tone identification tasks. However, most studies focus only on response accuracy, leaving the question whether the strategies used by these observers are absolute (i.e., not based on a comparison with an internal or external reference point different from the judged note) or relative (based on estimates of intervals between notes and internal or external reference points). To gain further insight into the nature of tone identification by individuals with absolute pitch, we collected response time data from three participants in a standard two-octave tone identification task. The data showed reliable differences in response time between notes within individuals. We discuss the implications of these differences, and provide an account of judgment by observers with absolute pitch in terms of a relative strategy based on multiple internal references.",>Malik Refaat>Koen Lamberts,>University of Warwick>University of Warwick,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0489/index.html
2011,Canonical views of scenes depend on the shape of the space,"When recognizing or depicting objects, people show a preference for particular canonical views. Are there similar preferences for particular views of scenes? We investigated this question using panoramic images, which show a 360-degree view of a location. Observers used an interactive viewer to explore the scene and select the best view. We found that agreement between observers on the best view of each scene was generally high. We attempted to predict the selected views using a model based on the shape of the space around the camera location and on the navigational constraints of the scene. The model performance suggests that observers select views which capture as much of the surrounding space as possible, but do not consider navigational constraints when selecting views. These results seem analogous to findings with objects, which suggest that canonical views maximize the visible surfaces of an object, but are not necessarily functional views.",>Krista A.

2011,Measurements and Estimations of Subjective Hand Force Exertions,"Subjective rating is one of the alternatives to quantify hand force exertion. The rating of the Borg CR-10 scale has been used to quantify the perception of physical exertion. An experiment was conducted to test the grip force of male subjects at subjective ratings on the CR-10 scale under hand-posture conditions. It was found that the subjects applied a higher grip force than they perceived at levels 2, 5, and 7 on the scale. The grip forces between dominant and non-dominant hands at low levels were negligible. The grip forces were significantly different between the two hands at level 10. Similar results were found for the posture conditions. The overall correlation coefficient between the CR-10 rating and the grip force was significant (r=0.92; p<0.0001). This implied that the Borg CR-10 is an valid tool in quantifying power grip force.",>Kai-Way Li,>Chung Hua University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0491/index.html
2011,"Hypothetical Cognition and Coalition Enforcement. Language, Morality, and Violence","The so-called coalition enforcement hypothesis sees humans as self-domesticated animals engaged in the continuous activity of building morality, incorporating at the same time punishment policies. Its main intellectual value stresses the role in human and animal groups of more or less stable stages of cognitive cooperation through morality and related inexorable violence. Hypothetical thinking and abduction are often embedded in various kinds of the so-called fallacious reasoning: indeed, in evolution, coalition enforcement works through the building of social cognitive niches seen as new ways of diverse human adaptation, where guessing hypotheses is central and where guessing hypotheses is occurring as it can, depending on the cognitive/moral options human beings adopt. Basically, the coalition enforcement framework refers to cooperation between related and unrelated human animals to produce significant mutual benefit that exceeds costs and is thereby potentially adaptive for the cooperators.",>Lorenzo Magnani,">Department of Philosophy, University of Pavia

2011,A Theory of How Heuristics Work in Cognition,"I provide a general cognitive architecture that enables heuristic reasoning. I argue that heuristics operate by exploiting informationally rich, specialized systems of knowledge. An analysis reveals that these knowledge systems are concepts. The notion of concepts I adopt is unlike many of the common philosophical theories; it is an adaptation from a theory envisioned by psychologist Lawrence Barsalou, who views concepts as inherently perceptual. I critically engage this theory of concepts and assess it against the increasingly popular file metaphor of cognition, which views concepts as files that contain collections of information about their referents. The resulting view is that concepts are highly organized collections of linguistically coded and perceptual information. The implication with respect to heuristic cognition is that the informational content of our concepts is organized in such a way that there exist patterns of relations among concepts which guide heuristic processes.",>Sheldon Chow,>The University of Western Ontario,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0493/index.html

Several recalcitrant problems in philosophy are based on the same mistake in which philosophers take their own knowledge of the truth rather than the subjects justified belief as relevant to belief ascription. Specifically, externalism regarding mental content rests on intuitions such as those evoked by Putnams Twin Earth example. However, despite its subjective force, externalism may be undermined by attending to its aetiology and showing how the intuitions arise from deceptive mechanisms. Instead of defending internalism directly, I ask: Why does externalism seem so convincing?

2011,Ad-hoc scalar implicature in adults and children,"Linguistic communication relies on pragmatic implicatures such as the inference that if ""some students passed the test,"" not all did. Yet young children perform poorly on tests of implicature, especially scalar implicatures using ""some"" and ""all,"" until quite late in development. We investigate the origins of scalar implicature using tasks in which the scale arises from real-world context rather than conventional contrasts between lexical items. Experiment 1 shows that these ad-hoc implicatures are easy for preschool children, suggesting that children have an early competence at pragmatic inference, and that failures in standard scalar implicature tasks are due instead to problems contrasting lexical items. Experiments 2 and 3 compare a Gricean, counterfactual account of implicature with a linguistic alternatives account and find that neither predicts effects of contextual informativeness. We conclude that an account of pragmatic implicature must integrate world knowledge, linguistic structure, and social reasoning.",>Alex Stiller>Noah Goodman>Michael Frank,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0495/index.html
2011,Inferential Processes Based on Goals in Explicit Communication a Theoretical Approach,"The paper shows how the explicit content of communication, that is what is said by a speaker, is obtained via inferential processes based on speakers goals. The proposal of the paper is based on the hypothesis that meaning in use depends on extra-semantic interests of speakers with regard to a specific situation. Elsewhere it is argued how interests affect on sentences of natural language when semantic context, semantic conventions and standard pragmatic context are not able to determine a unique meaning (Cruciani 2010a, 2009a). This paper specifically faces the question of determination of meaning via inferential processes in which the conditions of possibility of goals (interests) of speaker are premises of communicative inferences. In this approach is central the notion of interest viewed as (preference for) a state of affairs which implies conditions of possibility of agents goal.",>Marco Cruciani,>University of Trento,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0496/index.html
2011,Exploiting the Soft Constraints Hypothesis to Mitigate Interruption Effects,"The soft constraints hypothesis (Gray et al., 2006) posits that a more memory-based strategy is induced with increasing costs of accessing goal-state information. This relationship was used advantageously to reduce forgetting in an interrupted visuo-spatial copying task, although it increased overall task completion time (Morgan et al., 2009). However, in problem solving, studies have found that increased goal-state access cost resulted in more planning before action and improved efficiency following interruption, without the attendant disadvantage of increased solution time. In the current experiment, following Monk et al. (2008), we examined whether increased goal access cost could protect against the negative effects of longer and more demanding interrupting tasks during problem solving. Participants in a high access cost condition completed problems in fewer moves following a 13-second interruption and resumed faster following 8- and 13-second interruptions, compared to a low access cost condition.

The results showed that video-based communication method was more supportive of cooperative tasks when the task difficulty was high, and when there were more inherent conflicts in the task, in which more negotiation was required to resolve the conflicts. As a result, performance difference of the dyad was smaller in video communication. Different patterns of task completion time, problem space visitations and conversation dynamics further supported the effect of communication methods.

2011,Forecasting the evolution of a system: the role of cognitive strategies in complexity discovery,"The present study investigates the use of cognitive strategies to forecast the evolution of a complex and dynamic situation. The experimental task requires subjects to predict the evolution (t+1) of the state of multiple variables within a self-determined situation embedded in a system dynamics simulation. Four distinct scenarios entail a total of 24 variables that evolve dynamically at different levels of complexity. Complexity of the evolution is measured by its distance from a linear model. Results show that performance (i.e. fit of predictions to real simulation change) decreases as complexity of the evolution increases. Data also suggest that subjects adapt their strategy as the complexity increases, and hence achieve better performance than if they had kept their initial one. This suggests that cognitive strategies used to predict system evolution should be taken into account in modeling the relation between complexity and prediction performance.",>Jean-François Gagnon>Sébastien Tremblay,>Université Laval>Université Laval,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0499/index.html
2011,Cross-dimensional Mappings in Sound Symbolic Foreign Words,"Sound symbolism-- non-arbitrary correspondences between the sound of a word and its meaning-- exists cross-linguistically and facilitates listeners ability to infer the meaning of foreign words. However, the specificity of these mappings remains unclear. The present study investigated whether sound symbolic properties correspond only to a specific meaning domain or to other semantic dimensions as well. Native English-speaking adults heard sound symbolic foreign translations of eight dimensional adjectives (big, small, round, pointy, fast, slow, moving, still), and for each word (e.g., ""bamba"" meaning 'big'), chose a correct translation from two English antonym pairs (one matched and one mismatched with word dimension, e.g. big, small, fast, slow). Listeners selected meanings within the matched choice dimension more often than the mismatched choice dimension, suggesting that although sound symbolic properties facilitate foreign word interpretation across a range of meanings, this facilitative effect is greatest for mappings within a specific meaning domain.",>Christina Y.

2011,Asymmetry in Stroop interference arising from naming practice: shape beats color,"Stroop interference is characterized by strong asymmetry between word and color naming such that the former is faster and interferes with the latter but not vice versa. This asymmetry is attributed to differential experience with naming in the two dimensions, i.e., words and colors. Here we show that training on a visual-verbal paired associate task equivalent to color and shape naming leads to strongly asymmetric interference patterns. 28 adults practiced naming colors and novel shapes, one dimension more extensively (10 days) than the other (2 days), using nonsense syllables. Despite equal training, color naming was strongly affected by shape even after extensive practice, whereas shape naming was more resistant to interference. To reconcile these findings with theoretical accounts of interference, reading may be conceptualized as involving visual-verbal associations akin to ""shape naming."" An inherent advantage for naming shapes may provide an evolutionary substrate for the invention and development of reading.",>Athanassios Protopapas>Artemis Markatou,>University of Athens>University of Athens,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0501/index.html

The results of the meaningfulness decision task show that the vehicle-after-topic sentence and the vehicle-before-topic sentence were judged as meaningful more quickly than the no-vehicle sentence.

Few studies, however, have considered how such processes work together in tasks that require multiple control processes. This paper reports a computational study of random sequence generation and the cognitive control processes involved therein. The task, which is argued to involve multiple control processes, produces several dependent measures. These measures are held to be differentially dependent on the differential efficacy of the various underlying control processes. Initial simulations demonstrate that the model is capable of reproducing subject performance on the basic task. Additional simulations explore differential interference effects of different secondary tasks (held to interfere with different control processes) on the different random generation dependent measures. The work illustrates how the putative control processes may interact in the production of successive responses during the random generation task.",>Richard P.

We target the role of intent, the mind of the moral agent or the artist, i.e. whether the moral act or work of art was intentional or accidental, for objective judgments (e.g., quality) versus subjective judgments (e.g., preference). We show that (1) intent matters more for objective versus subjective judgments, in ethics and aesthetics, and (2) overall, intent matters more for moral judgments than aesthetic evaluations. These findings suggest that an objective-subjective dimension may similarly describe judgments in both ethics and aesthetics, and that in general we may be more influenced by the mind of the moral agent than by the mind of the artist when evaluating their impact on the world.",>Angelina Hawley-Dolan>Liane Young,">Boston College>Boston College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0505/index.html

Cognitive load was also manipulated in Experiment 1, to check whether any of the two factors can be moderated by System 2 processes. The main effects of controllability and severity and the interaction effects of the two were significant. The simple effect of severity was larger in the less severe conditions. However, the main effect or the interaction effects of cognitive load was not significant. In Experiment 2, participants were primed to do system 2 processing by direct instruction or indirect priming. None of the two priming had significant effects.

Currently, however, little has been known about the interface between such syntactic or proof-theoretical aspects and the corresponding semantic or informational aspects of diagram use. The present paper investigates the cognitive processes of interpreting diagrammatic representations underlying deductive reasoning, combining the insights from both logical and cognitive studies of diagrams. A semantical analysis of two different ways of formalizing logic diagrams is provided. Based on it, a multiple stage model of cognitive processes of extracting information from logic diagrams is proposed, and evidence was found to support this model.

In addition to being free to develop a valid proof as a justification, students were also asked to generate numeric examples to test the conjecture. Students demonstrated strategic reasoning in their empirical approaches by varying the quantity, parity, magnitude, and typicality of the numbers selected. These strategies were more developed in students who initially believed in the truth of the conjecture as well as in students who generated a valid, deductive proof. Emphasizing students strategic selection of diverse examples parallels inductive reasoning in other domains. Strategic use of examples in justifying conjectures has the potential to assist students development of deductive proof strategies.",>Jennifer Cooper>Candace Walkington>Caroline Williams>Olubukola Akinsiku>Charles Kalish>Amy Ellis>Eric Knuth,>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison>University of Wisconsin - Madison,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0509/index.html
2011,The inhumane accusative: an empirical investigation,"Leo Weisgerber (1957/58) made the much debated claim that in German referring to human beings via a direct (accusative) object where an indirect (dative) object paraphrase would be available is an inhumane choice, since it entails subtly depersonalizing the referent: Dative use implies ascribing human characteristics to referents, accusative use amounts to degrading them to mere objects. Assuming that agentivity and mental experience in action are salient human characteristics, Weisgerber's claim fits nicelly with the dative and accusative object prototypes proposed by Langacker (1991): A dative object suggests an active experiencer, an accusative object an inanimate thing. In his cognitive model of German cases, Smith (1985) observed also a difference in action participation between these personal objects. We used a priming experiment to test the hypothesis that persons introduced via dative as opposed to accusative objects are more readily perceived as highly agentive and mentally involved.",>Luenya Santiago dos Santos>Dietmar Zaefferer,>Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich>Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0510/index.html
2011,Directional Bias Induced Error Patterns when Translating Structural Representations,"Organic chemists must be adept at translating between various structural diagrams that represent the spatial configurations of molecules from different orthogonal perspectives. In three studies, participants translated between three structural diagrams showing side-view (Dash-Wedge), end-on (Newman), and top-down (Fischer) perspectives. Analyses showed strong directional biases in the drawn diagram relative to the given diagram for all six translation pairs. The left, front and top defined the dominant position of the different projections and translations typically preserved this dominance. For example, elements on the left of a Dash-Wedge were typically drawn on the front of a Newman and vice versa. These results are interpreted in relation to cultural influences that bias drawing direction. Analysis of the drawn diagrams also revealed that errors were most frequent in the non-dominant position, suggesting that translations are performed piecemeal due to spatial working memory limits, with priority given to dominant positions in the drawing sequence.",>Andrew Stull>Trevor Barrett>Mary Hegarty,">Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences,

2011,Experimental investigation of effects of representations and contexts on comprehension and generation of line graphs,"In this study, we investigated the representation effect in comprehending graphs. Many previous studies have confirmed the representation effect. In Experiment 1, we replicated the representation effect but using a set of graphs each of which is completely identical from the other in its perceptual characteristics. Participants drew a specific aspect of information from a line graph depending on the relation of x-axis and z-legend of the graph. In Experiment 2, participants were given a context for problem solving. The result showed that participants read a graph based on a given context; and the representation effect in comprehension was limited. In Experiment 3, participants generated a line graph by themselves. The result showed that they did not necessarily generate a consistent graph with a given context, and in comprehension the requirement of a context has very strong effects similarly as in Experiment 2.",>Nana Kanzaki>Kazuhisa Miwa,">Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University>Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0512/index.html
2011,The Impact of Autism Spectrum Disorder on the Categorisation of External Representations,"The knowledge structures and reasoning processes that underlie the use of external representations (ERs) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not well understood. We compare the organisation of knowledge of ERs in young people with ASD, with an age-matched typically developing control group. Participants were given an ER card-sorting task. The ERs were based on representations used in educational software, and included graphs, charts and text. Cluster analysis of the card-sorts revealed broadly similar clusters for both groups. However, there was a difference in basic level categories. While in the non-ASD group, maps were the most distinctive category, analysis of the ASD cluster revealed, in addition, another basic level category of text. These results are discussed in relation to theories of information processing in autism, and we draw implications for educational software in which ERs are able to support differences in information processing for individuals with ASD.",>Beate Grawemeyer>Hilary Johnson>Mark Brosnan>Emma Ashwin>Laura Benton,>University of Bath>University of Bath>University of Bath>University of Bath>University of Bath,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0513/index.html
2011,The Effects of LEGO Robotics and Embodiment in Elementary Science Learning,"Elementary school students often find science a complex subject to learn (Johnstone, 1991; Millar, 1991). Robotics have been used in previous studies to promote science learning as they provide students an environment to observe abstract concepts through the use of tangible, hands-on objects (Nagchaudhuri et al., 2002; Barker & Ansorge, 2007; Druin & Hendler, 2000). However, few studies have investigated the effects of integrating embodiment and LEGO Robotics to encourage students to physically experience abstract science concepts using their own bodies to enhance their conceptual understanding. This study aimed to examine the importance and role of embodiment in elementary science learning through the use of LEGO Robotics. Participants were fifth graders attending a semester-long after-school program for two hours each week. The results revealed that the children in the embodiment intervention group had a better understanding of and a more positive attitude toward science than those without the embodiment intervention.",>Carol M.

2011,The Construction Meaning of Interrogatives: Evidence From Embodied Grammar,"In formal semantics polar interrogatives are often conceived as pairs of a proposition and its negation (Hamblin 1958). While allowing for interesting research, this view lacks plausible cognitive grounding. We therefore propose that propositional contents are represented by pairs of situation tokens and situation types: In positive declaratives the token fits (or fails to fit) the type, in interrogatives the question of fit does not arise because the token is insufficiently specified. In order to test this assumption we adapted an embodied grammar experimental design that demonstrated the actionsentence compatibility effect (ACE, Glenberg & Kaschak), the influence of the motion described in the sentence subjects are primed with on the motor response they perform: If described and performed motion match in direction, facilitation is observed, else inhibition. Our results are incompatible with the Hamblin view: Interrogatives trigger an ACE between those of positive and negative declaratives.",>Dietmar Zaefferer>Luenya Santiago dos Santos,>LMU Munich>LMU Munich,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0515/index.html
2011,Lexical Priming without Similarity or Association,"Integrative relations, which combine two independent concepts (e.g., lake and bird) into a compound representation (lake bird), induce lexical priming. For example, lake speeds lexical decisions to bird even though they are semantically dissimilar, lexically unassociated, and unfamiliar as a phrase. We report three experiments that investigate whether this integrative priming occurs prospectively (i.e., the prime pre-activates the target) or retrospectively (i.e., prime and target are integrated post-presentation). Integrative (e.g., lake -> bird), associative (e.g., canary -> bird), and unrelated word pairs (e.g., trial -> bird) were presented in the perceptual identification, reading aloud, and Stroop color naming tasks, which are thought to measure prospective processing. Integrative pairs and associative pairs both elicited robust priming. That is, prime words (e.g., lake) facilitated recognition of dissimilar, unassociated target words (e.g., bird). Although similarity and association may explain other lexical and sentential priming effects, our results suggest instead a prospective integration process.",>Zachary Estes>Lara L.

2011,A Tale of Two Semantic Systems: Taxonomic and Thematic Knowledge,"Behavioral, neuroimaging, and lesion analysis data suggest two parallel semantic systems. One system, with anterior temporal lobe as critical hub, captures taxonomic relations based on feature overlap. A second system, with temporo-parietal junction as critical hub, captures thematic relations based on complementary roles in events. We describe a computational model of this theory that accounted for a one-way behavioral dissociation in aphasic picture naming errors (more taxonomic errors than thematic errors) and a neuroanatomical double dissociation (damaging feature representations led to relatively more taxonomic errors, damaging event representations led to relatively more thematic errors). The model also predicted that both taxonomic and thematic competitors should be automatically activated during single word processing, with taxonomic competitors activated more quickly and more strongly. These predictions were tested and confirmed in a spoken word comprehension experiment using eye tracking to assess the time course of competitor activation.",>Daniel Mirman>Grant M. Walker>Kristen M.

2011,Why Neurons Cannot be Detectors: Shifting Paradigms from Sherlock Holmes to Elvis Presley?,"The practice of treating neurons as detectors is ubiquitous in the neuro-science community and in AI as well, in the context of neural networks. But there are a growing number of cognitive scientists who think that the representational paradigm is ill-suited to this level of explanation. In this paper, I rehearse William Ramseys powerful critique of neural-detector attribution, focusing on his argument that Dretske-style information theoretic accounts of representation fail to justify the practice. I then take this conclusion a step further by arguing that not only does this particular justification fail, none at all are possible. The conclusion that we need to let go of the representational paradigm is not a negative one though, I shall claim, because it liberates us from the kind of misguided thinking that leads to theoretical dead-ends. Once we see this, we are free to investigate new, more fruitful, paradigms.",>Nancy Salay,>Queen's University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0518/index.html
2011,Inducing homonymy effects via stimulus quality and (not) nonword difficulty: Implications for models of semantic ambiguity and word recognition,"Reports of a processing advantage for polysemes with related senses (e.g., <printer>/<academic> PAPER) in lexical decision and a processing disadvantage for homonyms (e.g., <river>/<money> BANK) in semantic categorization have prompted the development of conflicting accounts of these phenomena. Whereas a decision-making account (Hino, Pexman, & Lupker, 2006) suggests these effects are due to qualitative differences between the tasks, accounts based on temporal settling dynamics (Armstrong & Plaut, 2008) suggest that processing time is the critical factor. To compare these accounts, we manipulated nonword difficulty and stimulus quality to make lexical decision difficult and attempted to produce the same homonymy disadvantage as in semantic categorization. We found that stimulus degradation succeeded to this end, and nonword difficulty only consistently slowed nonword responses. This provides evidence both for settling dynamics accounts of semantic ambiguity in particular, and for interactive orthographic-to-semantic processing and the construction of more integrated models, in general.",>Blair Armstrong>David Plaut,">Department of Psychology and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Carnegie Mellon University>Department of Psychology and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Carnegie Mellon University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0519/index.html

We describe the architecture of the basic tools behind the games, the structure of the resulting data, and how this information may be integrated into existing statistical semantic models. We also describe two validations using data collected from one of the tools (2D Geon Pictionary) demonstrating typicality effects in the metrics of raw Geon objects created by subjects, and unique variance in the predictions of word pair metrics over currently used linguistic and property data.",>Brent Kievit-Kylar>Michael Jones,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0520/index.html
2011,Modeling Utterance-mediated Attention in Situated Language Comprehension,Empirical evidence from studies using the visual world paradigm reveals that spoken language guides attention in a related visual scene and that scene information can influence the comprehension process. Here we model sentence comprehension using the visual context. A recurrent neural network is trained to associate the linguistic input with the visual scene and to produce the interpretation of the described event. The feedback mechanism in the form of sigma-pi connection is added to model the explicit utterance-mediated visual attention behavior revealed by the visual world paradigm. The results show that the network successfully learns sentence final interpretation and also demonstrates the hallmark anticipation behavior of predicting upcoming constituents.,>Jan Svantner>Igor Farkas>Matthew Crocker,">Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia>Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia>Saarland University, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0521/index.html
2011,Becoming a Gamer: Cognitive Effects of Real-Time Strategy Gaming,"Video games are rich, dynamic, and fast-paced virtual environments that tap a number of cognitive processes. Prior work reveals that experienced video game players (and novices who become experienced) demonstrate enhanced cognitive and perceptual performance in a range of tasks. It is not clear why video gaming leads to these enhancements. To address this, we use real-time strategy games which require dynamic attention and multitasking skills. We employ a variety of novel methods to capture which game features are associated with various cognitive enhancements. Specifically, we use model-based analysis of empirical feature selection priorities, tests of generation via multiple game maps, and a map manipulation of centered versus bimodal attentional load. Novice participants engaged in 40 hours of game-training, with cognitive testing occurring before, during, and after training. We consider the plasticity of cognitive abilities over training in light of these well controlled factors.",>Brian D. Glass>Marc T. Tomlinson>W. Todd Maddox>Bradley C.

2011,The effect of prompted causal identification in transfer of experimental design skills,"A central goal of instruction is to enable learners to transfer acquired knowledge to future situations. For elementary school children in middle-high-SES schools, explicit instruction on the Control of Variables Strategy (CVS) that emphasizes understanding of the rationale for CVS has proven to be effective at promoting transfer to different contexts, even after extended time delays. However, when the same instruction was delivered to students in low-SES schools, nearbut especially fartransfer rates were much lower. We tested our hypothesis that understanding the rationale for CVSthat only the focal variable should be contrasted so only it can affect the outcomepromotes far-transfer performance by comparing the outcomes of sixth-grade students given the standard explicit instruction to students additionally prompted to identify all possible causal variables in presented set-ups. As predicted, students given the additional prompts performed better on the far-transfer assessments in particular. This effect was greater for lower-knowledge students.",>Stephanie Siler>David Klahr>Kevin Willows>Cressida Magaro,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0523/index.html
2011,Making oneself predictable: Reduced temporal variability facilitates joint action coordination,"Performing joint actions with others often requires precise temporal coordination of individual actions. So far, little is known about how people achieve interpersonal coordination at discrete points in time when continuous information about others actions is not available. Here we tested the hypothesis that coordinating actions without continuous information exchange may require the use of coordination strategies. A reaction time study, in which pairs of participants were instructed to act in synchrony or in close temporal succession, provides evidence for a strategic reduction of the variability of ones own actions. Specifically, the less variable co-actors actions were, the better was interpersonal coordination. The relation between predictability and coordination performance was not observed when co-actors performed independent tasks without intending to coordinate. These findings support the claim that making oneself predictable is used as a coordination strategy. Identifying coordination strategies contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in real-time coordination.",>Cordula Vesper>Robrecht van der Wel>Günther Knoblich>Natalie Sebanz,">Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour>Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0524/index.html
2011,Norms as Direct Explanations of Behavior.,"When explaining someones behavior, reference is often made to Theory of Mind concepts like beliefs (she believed it was the right thing to do) or desires (she wanted to). Less appreciated is the explanatory potential for descriptive and prescriptive norms (e.g., she returned the wallet because it was the right thing to do). One possibility is that norms serve as explanations only when mediated by beliefs, suggesting a norm-belief asymmetry whereby the quality of a norm explanation depends on belief, but not the reverse. However, two experiments provide evidence that norms influence participants explanations for behavior without meditating beliefs, whether the norm is moral, conventional, or statistical, and regardless of participants meta-ethical commitments (relativist or objectivist). Our results suggest that much like physical laws (e.g., explaining someones fall by reference to gravity), norms are endorsed as direct explanations for behavior.

2011,When Two Become One: Temporally Dynamic Integration of the Face and Voice,"In everyday interactions, people have to deal with the sight of a face and sound of a voice at the same time. How the perceptual system brings this information together remains unclear. In 2 studies, we investigated how facial and vocal cues are integrated during social categorization by recording participants' hand movements (via the x, y coordinates of the computer mouse) en route to male and female responses on the screen. Participants were presented with male and female faces that were accompanied by a same-sex voice morphed to be either sex-typical or sex-atypical. Before settling into ultimate sex categorizations of the face, the simultaneous processing of a sex-atypical voice led the hand to be continuously attracted to the opposite sex-category response. This is evidence that ongoing results from voice perception continuously influence face perception across processing. Thus, social categorization involves dynamic updates of gradual integration of the face and voice.",>Jeffrey Brooks>Jonathan Freeman>Nalani Ambady,>Tufts University>Tufts University>Tufts University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0526/index.html
2011,Decision factors that support preference learning,People routinely draw inferences about others' preferences by observing their decisions. We study these inferences by characterizing a space of simple observed decisions. Previous work on attribution theory has identified several factors that predict whether a given decision provides strong evidence for an underlying preference. We identify one additional factor and show that a simple probabilistic model captures all of these factors. The model goes beyond verbal formulations of attribution theory by generating quantitative predictions about the full set of decisions that we consider. We test some of these predictions in two experiments: one with decisions involving positive effects and one with decisions involving negative effects. The second experiment confirms that inferences vary in systematic ways when positive effects are replaced by negative effects.,>Alan Jern>Charles Kemp,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0527/index.html
2011,Simulating a route with your index finger: Effect of mental rehearsal on spatial memory,"This paper examines which rehearsal method (physical practice vs. mental practice) can better strengthen spatial memory. Participants were asked to learn four routes that navigated from starting points to destinations in four different maps. Then they were asked to rehearse the routes by using one of the following methods: 1) mental practice by simulating the routes in their mind; 2) physical practice by drawing the routes on papers; 3) physical practice by having index fingers trace the routes in air with eyes closed; and 4) physically practice by having index fingers trace the routes in air with eyes open. Finally, they verbally recalled the routes. The findings showed that physical practice with index fingers tracing the routes in air while keeping the eyes closed outperformed other rehearsal methods. Thus, tracing directions in air without any visual inputs can help participants to retain the visuo-spatial memory.",>Wing Chee So,>National University of Singapore,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0528/index.html
2011,Employers and Employees: How Narrative Perspective Influences Agent Placement in a Simulated Work Environment,"Virtual character agreement has an underlying spatial component, where increased physical distance is associated with decreased shared attitude (Matthews & Matlock, 2010). This work addresses the relationship between expected character interaction and agent placement in a simulated work environment. After imagining being either an employer or an employee in a meeting about salary adjustments, participants drew an employee figure in a virtual office environment. When taking the employees perspective, participants placed virtual agents reliably closer to their employers agent when expecting to discuss a pay raise, and farther away when expecting to discuss a pay cut. No inter-agent differences were found when readers took the employers perspective. These results suggest that agent viewpoint is important in virtual environments. Not only does inter-agent distance influence employer/employee agreement, as previous work has shown, this relationship seems to be bi-directional, where narrative content also influences agent placement.",>Justin L.

The children were assigned randomly to either the comparison group, which learned the map through comparison, or to the control group, which learned the map without direct comparison to the neighborhood. We measured participants understanding of the map using three tasks that measured childrens ability to reason about correspondences between spatial relations on the map and in the pretend neighborhood. The same three tasks were also carried out afterward on a different neighborhood in order to test if the ability of understanding maps could be transferred to a new neighborhood.

Improving spatial skills is therefore of both theoretical and practical importance. To determine whether and to what extent training can improve these skills, we meta-analyzed 217 research studies, investigating the magnitude, moderators, durability and generalizability of training on spatial skills. The average effect size (Hedges g) for training relative to control was .47 (SE = .04). Effect sizes were affected substantially by the presence of control groups. When treatment and control group improvements were considered separately, the mean effect size for trained groups was .62 (SE = .04), while the effect size for control groups was only .45 (SE = .04). Training effects were durable, and led to near and medium transfer. Considered together, the results suggest that spatially enriched education could pay substantial dividends in increasing participation in STEM disciplines.",>Nathaniel Meadow>David Uttal>Elizabeth Tipton>Nora Newcombe,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Temple University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0531/index.html
2011,Language and spatial frames of reference: The effect of verbal interference,"People think about spatial frames of reference (FoRs) in accord with the spatial system of their native language. It has been claimed that this correlation reflects a causal influence of language on thought. We tested this claim. Earlier studies have shown that whereas English speakers favor an egocentric FoR, there is a pre-linguistic predisposition favoring a geocentric FoR. We reasoned that if language plays a central on-line role in spatial cognition, verbal interference should disrupt egocentric responding and reveal the underlying geocentric bias. We conducted a standard spatial rotation task on English speakers, with and without verbal interference. Under verbal interference, compared with no interference, we found less egocentric responding, as predicted, and an increase in error. However, in contrast with prediction, the amount of geocentric responding did not differ across the two conditions. These results suggest that language does not play an on-line role in overriding a geocentric bias.",>Sophie Bridgers>Terry Regier,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0532/index.html

They marked the target both on partial maps in birds-eye perspective or on a tilted plane (oblique perspective). After completing both maps, participants added an arrow pointing north to their drawings. Most type B maps were oriented north-up, but orientation varied widely in type A maps. Our findings suggest that most participants remembered a topographic map for depicting the large-scale space, no matter in which perspective the map was drawn. For depicting the relationship of a close location (i.e., the lake), most participants seem to rely on embodied strategies or a strategy based on route knowledge.",>Julia Frankenstein>Christoph Hölscher,">Center for Cognitive Science

To complete the task they had to pass a choice point at which they were forced to choose one of two paths, both leading to the target location. Both paths had a different number of visible further movement options. The least-decision load theory predicts that participants choose the path with fewer options (because the risk of getting lost is smaller) while the maximization theory predicts that participants choose the path with more options to maximize the number of potential successive steps. We hypothesize that the choice is modulated by demands of the current task.

Exp. 1 was conducted in a real supermarket (tracing participants by means of RFID techniques) and replicated in a virtual environment (Exp. 2). Exp. 3 used a VR variation where all the pictures on the shelves of the VR supermarket were replaced with printed labels.

During such a belief revision reasoners have to decide which beliefs to retain and which ones to retract in order to regain consistency within their belief states. Drawn from the conception that spatial belief revision is based on the alteration of mental models, we discuss the influence of cognitive effort and minimal change when constructing and revising mental models. We offer several possibilities how minimal change can be defined in this context and provide a computational model along with a cost function to describe the revision processes. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence for the suitability of the model. Results indicate that there is a significant influence of cognitive efficiency principles on spatial belief revision.",>Antje Krumnack>Leandra Bucher>Jelica Nejasmic>Markus Knauff,">Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science,

2011,Horizontal Trumps Vertical in the Spatial Organization of Numerical Magnitude,"The vast majority of research on the spatial nature of numerical representation has focused on the horizontal axis, highlighting the left-to-right orientation of increasing values. Recent evidence points to spatial organization along the vertical (bottom-to-top) axis as well, but these findings are better characterized as generalized magnitude mappings between number and other magnitude dimensions (e.g., near-far spatial extent). Here we replicate generalized magnitude mappings for number (Exp. 1A) and show that they take precedence over left-to-right orientation (Exp. 1B). In contrast, we find no evidence of spontaneous organization along the true vertical axis (Exp. 2A) and show that left-to-right orientation trumps bottom-to-top orientation when the two are inconsistent (Exp. 2B). Reliable bottom-to-top orientation was evident only after priming of magnitude relations among numbers (Exp. 3). Together, these findings demonstrate that number is more strongly represented horizontally than vertically. We suggest that experience with cultural tools may drive this asymmetry.",>Kevin J.

Weighted semantic maps are semantic maps that have weights assigned to edges to correspond to the strength of the connection between two concepts. The objective of the work reported here was to investigate the feasibility of automatically extracting weighted semantic maps of various concepts from writings of two different cultural groups to see if they can help in understanding cross-cultural differences. We used a modified version of ICAN algorithm to create weighted semantic graphs of concepts such as Jihad and God from Quran and Hamas postings on the web. We found interesting differences between the semantic maps extracted from the two sources. The Quranic concept of Jihad was tied to concepts of striving, cause and attacked, while the Hamas concept was most closely related to confront, command and require.",>M.

The game requires flexible coordination of perceptual, cognitive and motor components in a dynamically changing environment. We examined whether effective instruction can be developed for such a task in the same way that instruction is developed for academic tasks. Instruction was developed for certain aspects of the game based on a set of explicit procedural rules in an ACT-R model that plays the game. Participants who were given these instructions were significantly better at handling those aspects of the game that the instructions targeted. The results indicate that it is possible to perform a task analysis of a dynamic task, develop explicit instructions from the analysis, and improve target skills.

For both phrase and word ordering errors, integrated stimuli were more error-prone than unintegrated stimuli.

All versions assessed the same science inquiry skills (e.g., making observations, designing experiments, evaluating predictions etc.). Eight middle-school students completed each assessment version while thinking aloud. On items that required declarative knowledge, students performed similarly across versions. However, on items requiring more sophisticated reasoning (e.g., experimental design), students performed better when generating their own trials in the interactive version, than when recognizing correctly designed trials in the active and static versions. The results suggest that simulation-based assessments provide more complete measures of students' science proficiency.",>Jodi Davenport>Edys Quellmalz>Michael Timms,>WestEd>WestEd>WestEd,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0542/index.html
2011,Temporal Dynamics of Scan Patterns in Comprehension and Production,"Speakers and listeners in a dialogue establish mutual understanding by coordinating their linguistic responses. When a visual scene is present, scan patterns on that scene are also coordinated. However, it is an open question which linguistic and scene factors affect coordination. In this paper, we investigate the coordination of scan patterns during the comprehension and generation of scene descriptions. We manipulate the animacy of the subject and the number of visual referents associated with it. By using Cross Recurrence Analysis, we demonstrate that coordination emerges only during linguistic processing, and that it is especially pronounced for inanimate unambiguous subjects. When the subject is referentially ambiguous (more than one visual object associated with it), scan pattern variability increases to the extent that the animacy effect is neutralized.",>Moreno I.

2011,Representation and acquisition of symmetrical verbs,"Languages use two distinct classes of verbs to encode the following distinct event types. Mutual events, in which participants share equal, reciprocal roles, are encoded by symmetrical verbs (e.g. meet). Non-mutual events, in which participants have distinct and non-reciprocal roles, are encoded by asymmetrical verbs (e.g. kick) (Gleitman, Gleitman, Miller, Ostrin, 1996; Dimitriadis, 2008). These two classes of verbs participate in distinct syntactic structures, which differentiate between them. For example, sentences Sam met Jane and Sam kicked Jane entail mutual vs. non-mutual participation but a singular event, while sentences Sam and Jane met and Sam and Jane kicked differ in both the type of participation and the number of sub-events (1 for meet, 2 for kick).

2011,Normative cognition: a uniquely human cognitive capacity,"Normative cognition  a uniquely human cognitive capacity Normative cognition is a mongrel concept covering human cognition of symbolically mediated normative information. Humans have social and cultural cognition of which normative cognition is a subset. Humans can produce, distribute, acquire and implement social norms and values. Normative cognition requires certain cognitive skills such as 1) learning, remembering and 2) having capabilities in using symbols, concepts and norms as cognitive tools. Thus normative cognition 1) provides governance in cognizing and 2) aids in predicting probable ranges of behavior in self and others Minds create ecologies for other minds in normative conceptual systems: models for the world (in scripts / programs / frames ) and models of the world (socio-cultural classification systems) provide: Shared world-views and action patterns.

2011,Generating 3D Spatial Descriptions from Stereo Vision Using SIFT Keypoint Clouds,"To facilitate more natural interaction with robots, we have been investigating an approach for generating descriptions of objects in a scene, using point cloud models built with the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). The 3D models are constructed from 24 images taken from different viewing angles. For each recognized object, the model is placed into an internal representation of the environment, at the recognized location. The object keypoints are then projected onto horizontal and vertical planes. The convex hulls of the projected points are computed in each plane and used as boundary representations for computing the Histograms of Forces (HoF). Features from the HoF are then used in a system of fuzzy rules to generate descriptions using spatial referencing language, e.g., the cup is on the table to the right of the lamp. Support is included for right, left, front, behind, on top, above, below, inside, contains, and near.",>Marjorie Skubic>Samuel N. Blisard>Robert H. Luke III>Erik E. Stone>Derek T. Anderson>James M.

2011,Individual and Collaborative Learning from Text and Pictures: A Task Analysis,"This study focused on the cognitive processes involved in learning from text and pictures, when learning both individually and collaboratively. We designed a task in which learners actively engage with text and pictures in a lesson about mitosis, followed by a test of knowledge gained from the task. During the task, think-aloud protocols were collected. Preliminary results show that learners actively engage in cognitive processes that are thought to be essential to learning from text and pictures: selecting, organizing, and integrating (Mayer, 2001). The verbal protocol allows for a more detailed task analysis of these processes, as well as a correlational analysis between engagement in these steps and test performance, to be presented at the conference. Furthermore, while individuals and collaborating learners scored similarly on the knowledge test, their metacognitive strategies differed drastically. These results are important in understanding how students learn from popular interactive media involving text and pictures.",>Krista DeLeeuw>Katharina Scheiter>Friedrich Hesse,">Knowledge Media Research Center, Tuebingen, Germany>Knowledge Media Research Center, Tuebingen, Germany>Knowledge Media Research Center, Tuebingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0547/index.html
2011,Do information-theoretic measures of word-processing difficulty explain psycholinguistic phenomena?,"It has been proposed that cognitive processing effort at each word in a sentence depends on the amount of information conveyed by the word. Indeed, two formal measures of word information (surprisal and entropy reduction) correlate with reading times on words in general texts. If word information also accounts for psycholinguistic phenomena that have been taken as evidence for particular cognitive processes, these phenomena may need to be reinterpreted. A range of simple recurrent networks and phrase-structure grammars was used to estimate surprisal and entropy-reduction scores for the parts-of-speech of sentence stimuli from five experiments, concerning relative clause processing, local ambiguity, digging-in effects, and grammaticality illusions. None of the information measures predicted any critical experimental result, except for the SRN-based surprisals, which predicted the grammaticality illusion. This shows that many psycholinguistic findings are indeed indicative of cognitive effects beyond mere information-based processing difficulty.",>Stefan Frank,>University College London,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0548/index.html
2011,Shared pattern of face preferences in human infants and pet dogs,"Human eyes are unique. Unlike other primates whose pupils are masked by a dark sclera, the human eye highlights a dark pupil against a white sclera. Newborn infants look longer at schematic stimuli with three blobs arranged in a face-like configuration -- but only if the blobs match the dark-on-light phenotype of the human eye. If a visual preference for faces with human-like eyes is innately specified, it is a candidate for selection across domestication. Over thousands of years of evolution, wolves became dogs who are adept at working and living with us. We report visual preference data showing that adult pet dogs prefer to look at face-like stimuli with a human-like eye phenotype, even though this phenotype is not prevalent in dogs -- just as human infants do. Convergence in this visual preference suggests sensitivity to human eyes is an important behavioral adaptation for social partnership with humans.",>Jennifer M.D. Yoon>Friederike Range>Ludwig Huber>Gergely Csibra>Zsofia Viranyi,>Stanford University>University of Vienna>University of Vienna>Central European University>University of Vienna,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0549/index.html
2011,Learning categories from an intermittent teacher,"Category learners typically experience at least two types of learning episodes. Sometimes, stimuli are observed without labels (unsupervised learning), while at other times, a teacher provides a category label or name (supervised learning). Until recently, these two types of learning have been studied independent of one another, despite the fact that many influential models of category learning treat them as equivalent. In a series of experiments, we explored tasks in which both labeled and unlabeled exemplars were provided. We find that when unlabeled items are intermixed with numerous labeled exemplars, participants appear to decouple labeled items from unlabeled items. In contrast, when unlabeled items are intermixed with few labeled exemplars, participants integrate information across the two types of learning episodes. These results suggest that peoples tendency to integrate information from labeled and unlabeled learning episodes can be understood in terms of normative statistical inference.",>John V McDonnell>Todd M Gureckis,>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0550/index.html
2011,Universals and variation in spatial language and cognition: Evidence from Chichewa,"The relation of spatial language and spatial cognition is central to the debate over language and thought. Recent findings move this debate beyond the standard opposition between universalist and relativist (Whorfian) stances. Two such studies suggest that spatial language (Khetarpal et al., 2009) and the spatial cognition underlying it (Khetarpal et al., 2010) both reflect universal tendencies of spatial cognition modulated by linguistic convention. These studies gauged non-linguistic spatial cognition through English- and Dutch-speakers pile-sorting of spatial scenes by similarity. Since English and Dutch are closely related, we tested the generality of these findings with pile-sorting from speakers of Chichewa, a Bantu language of East Africa. We found that (1) the spatial systems of 9 unrelated languages near-optimally partition a similarity space derived from Chichewa sorting, and (2) this sorting reflects the semantic system of Chichewa itself, suggesting that Chichewa speakers sorting combines universal and language-specific aspects of spatial cognition.",>Alexandra Carstensen>Naveen Khetarpal>Asifa Majid>Terry Regier,">University of California, Berkeley>University of Chicago>Max-Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0551/index.html

The first study varied the inclusion/exclusion of static versus dynamic graphic presentations that accompanied learning modules. The second varied whether concepts of measure were explicitly taught before science learning. Children in both countries performed exceeding well on concepts thought to be difficult in learning about the speed and movement of molecules. Taiwanese children received far more rigorous training on measurement concepts than U.S. students. If measurement concepts were not taught explicitly, U.S. children lost ground rapidly. With explicit instruction, U.S, students improved but did not quite equal Taiwanese students. The role of time on task and diversity of problem presentations are discussed.",>Nancy L.

One practical factor often mentioned in relation to the difficulty of L2 listening passages is length, but there are several problems with characterizing the amount of information in a passage this way.

We hypothesized that people might be forming implicit assumptions to deal with the ambiguity resulting from the incomplete information in the problem, and that some assumptions might lead them to deviate from normative predictions. We embedded the Ellsberg problem in various scenarios that made one source of ambiguity (i.e., the implied distribution of the unknown number of the colored balls) explicit. Results of an experiment showed that more people chose consistently (and hence rationally) when the scenario encouraged them to think that the probability distribution of the number of balls was normal. The results give insight into the implicit assumptions that might lead to choices congruent with normative models.",>Sule Guney>Ben R.

2011,Prospective Memory Tasks in Aviation: Effects of Age and Working Memory,Prospective memory is the ability to remember to perform acts in the future and is essential in the aviation domain because it supports remembering to complete radio communications. In the laboratory younger adults tend to outperform older adults on prospective memory tasks; yet in naturalistic settings older adults perform as well as younger adults. Lower workload from background tasks and the habitual nature of the tasks are suggested reasons for the improved performance by older adults. We tested this notion using a Cessna 172 simulator to examine radio communication completion rates of 45 pilots. We found that older pilots had significantly lower communication task completion rates than younger pilots in both the low and high workload conditions. Multiple regression identified age and working memory as predictors of prospective memory performance in the low workload condition and working memory and recent pilot-in-command hours as predictors in the high workload condition.,>Kathleen Van Benthem>Chris M.

We suggest that one way to proceed is to frame the hypothesis within the larger theoretical framework of activity theory, and another is to conduct extensive field studies of extended cognitive processes.

Limited cognitive processing capabilities, however, impede an exhaustive search of the problem space. Thus, planning problems of the same size may require a different cognitive effort. Formal complexity aspects are inherent to a problem and set computational limits that a solver must deal with. For a measure of cognitive complexity, operational aspects of human cognition must be taken into account. We present a structural complexity measure for predicting human planning performance. This measure is based on the number and connectedness of subgoals necessary to solve a problem.

Models have attempted to operationalize interference in recognition memory as noise that accumulates over items in the study list, other contexts in which studied items have appeared, or a combination of both sources. Item noise models predict a list length effect. The list length effect has been eliminated in long-term recognition tasks. We demonstrate that the length effect may also be eliminated in short-term recognition (the Sternberg paradigm) if a filled delay is introduced. List length and recency effects were eliminated following an engaging 15 second distractor task.

2011,Investigating Convention Shifts and Team Reasoning in Multi-Agent Simulations,"Classical game theory struggles to explain how rational players should decide between a number of social conventions, even if some yield higher individual payoffs than others. Thus, on a population level a group or society may be stuck in using one convention when there exist alternative and potentially more beneficial ones. Using an agent-based model the current study examines how convention shifts from less to more beneficial conventions can come about. To investigate this, we use the concept of team reasoning, a mode of reasoning in which actors maximise the utility of a group rather than their own. Unlike other social decision-making mechanisms, such as forms of imitation, team reasoning enables the spread of a more profitable convention through a population even if no global knowledge about the population is available to agents.",>Anna Coenen>Ramsey Raafat>Nick Chater,>UCL>UCL>Warwick Business School,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0561/index.html

This paper tests whether an existent Instance-based Learning (IBL) model, built using the Instance-based Learning Theory (IBLT) to explain behavior in a single-person binary-choice task (BCT), can predict behavior in a two-player iterated prisoners dilemma (IPD) game. The same IBL model is generalized to two conditions in the IPD: Social, where individuals have information about their opponents and their choices; and Non-social, where individuals and opponents lack this information. We expect the single-person IBL model to predict behavior in the Non-social condition better than in the Social condition. However, due to the structural differences between BCT and IPD, we also expect only moderately good model predictions in the Non-social condition. Our results confirm these expectations.

The model embodies in its simplest form the notion that the attentional system involves competitive networks (Lee et al, 1999). Using this model, we are able to reproduce experimental differences in looking times between cued and non-cued conditions. We then show that differences between social and non-social cues recently observed in 8-month-old infants by Wu and Kirkham (2010) can be explained by the amount of information let through from non-cued locations.

Examining Evidence from the Multiattribute Choice Domain,"There is a prevalent claim in the judgment and decision making (JDM) literature that attention to a piece of information confers weight or importance upon that information. The prevalence of that claim is not commensurate with the empirical evidence  the quantity of evidence is sparse, and, is constrained by significant limitations in the methodological approach of previous studies. The current work presents a novel method for covertly manipulating attention to different components of a decision scenario. Using this approach, the current work provides empirical evidence from three multiattribute scenarios in support of a consistent, positive causal relationship between the attention allocated to a piece of information and the influence accorded to it. In addition, the current work demonstrates the viability of crowdsourcing psychological research, including research that involves significant perceptual components.",>Anirudh Tiwathia>William Goldstein,>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0566/index.html

2011,The Meta-structure of Knowledge and the Explanatory Gap,"Time and object are elements of the meta-structure of our knowledge, yet in conflict with the general change in the world. Time and object are shown to be products of our decomposition of change. Accordingly, there are no objects (and subjects) in the world: the object is the concept and its meaning is its relative position in the structure of knowledge. Thus, the referent is the concept and perception is the result of interpreting raw sensation within this conceptual structure. The material signifier of all our concepts is the sensation thus being the clay with which we shape our representations of the world. However, it is impossible to represent the clay itself using clay as material signifier. Therefore, the explanatory gap is nothing more than the un-closeable gap between signifier and signified. The gap can only be closed when filled with sensation (thus becoming part of the physical world). http://webs.uvigo.es/jmmatias/knowledge/knowledge.htm",>José M.

2011,The Influence of Additivity Training on Cue Competition Effects in Childrens Causal Learning,"The inferential reasoning account of causal learning holds that effortful reasoning processes underpin causal judgments. Evidence for this account comes from demonstrations that performance on cue competition tasks is affected by pretraining showing causal cues to be additive in their effects. If inferential reasoning underpins the additivity effect, then we might expect this effect to emerge developmentally. The current study provided 172 children (4-5-year-olds and 6-7- year-olds) with either additive or non-additive pre-training, involving a new child-friendly version of the allergy paradigm previously used to investigate cue competition effects in adults. We observed an effect of pre-training and age on causal judgments, with a significant effect of additivity training only in the older age group. These results are consistent with an inferential reasoning account of additivity and cue competition effects, and suggest that the ability to engage in the necessary inferential reasoning emerges developmentally.",>Victoria Simms>Teresa McCormack>Tom Beckers,>Queen's University Belfast>Queen's University Belfast>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0569/index.html
2011,"Your Tone Says It All: Affective Language Production, Perception and Action","Language, prosody and social cues to affective speech are essential for successful interpretation of intent (Attardo, Eisterhold, Hay & Pogi, 2005). Nygaard and Lunders (2002) have shown that affective prosody impacts the resolution of lexical ambiguity during spoken language, yet social cues are understudied. The current studies evaluate the impact of affective prosody and social factors (e.g., gender and perceived identity through dialect) associated with the production, perception and action upon intent behind spoken language. The results from the production study suggest that affect production may involve a substantial amount of talker variability. Though there was a considerable amount of talker variability in the productions, listeners seem to easily and accurately categorize intent, thus, relying heavily on talker related cues. Therefore, it would seem that talker variability, in the form of prosodic variation and social cues influence a listeners interpretation during the online processing intent.",>Jennifer Roche>Rick Dale>Amy Roche,>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0570/index.html

2011,Evidence for Alignment in a Computer-Mediated Text-Only Environment,"During interaction, people coordinate in verbal (e.g., syntactically and semantically) and nonverbal (e.g., gestural and prosodic) ways. This alignment has been suggested to be a result of grounding or priming. In both cases, visual cues assist understanding. This study explores how widely and how much participants align in a text-only environment. Forty-two participants debated a topic via Instant Messenger with a confederate. Using length analyses, LIWC, and LSA, results show punctuation and semantic alignment above chance between interlocutors, and an increase in this alignment over time. Affective alignment and alignment in parts of speech are weak, and the nature of the debate nor nonverbal cues affected alignment. These results extend previous theories of verbal alignment to text- only environments in which interlocutors lack visual cues during interaction and propose theoretical implications for alignment. However, lack of nonverbal alignment departs from face-to-face findings, and theoretical implications for such results are suggested.",>Monica Riordan>Rick Dale>Roger Kreuz>Andrew Olney,>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0572/index.html
2011,How Spoken and Signed Language Structure Space Differently,"Spatial concepts are structurally represented in spoken language by a 3-level system. At the componential level, there is a relatively closed universally available inventory of fundamental spatial elements. At the compositional level, elements of the inventory combine in particular arrangements to form whole spatial schemas. Each language has a relatively closed set of ""pre-packaged"" schemas of this sort. And at the augmentive level, the system includes a set of processes that can extend or deform pre-packaged schemas, enabling a language's particular set of schemas to be applied to a wider range of spatial structures. Signed language structurally represents space with a different system seemingly more like visual parsing. It can mark finer spatial distinctions with its inventory of more structural elements. It can represent many more of these distinctions in any particular expression. It represents these distinctions independently in the expression, not bundled together into pre-packaged schemas. And its spatial representations are largely iconic with visible spatial characteristics. The findings suggest that instead of some discrete whole-language module, spoken language and signed language are both based on some more limited core linguistic system that then connects with different further subsystems for the full functioning of the two different language modalities.",>Leonard Talmy,">Department of Linguistics and     Center for Cognitive Science

Research with a problem-based focus often requires a systems approach that requires assimilation of work from many different disciplines. Such problems thus constitute ideal domains for illustrating the benefits of such multi-discipline and multi-method approaches. Speakers will focus on the use of spatial thinking in the context of examining these applied problems. These speakers span at least two disciplines, one a traditional discipline represented within cognitive science, and the other a related discipline such as geosciences and architecture.",>Madeleine Keehner>Dan Montello>Sara Fabrikant>Eric M.

To date, however, minimal contact has been made between PDP models and physiological data from the brain performing cognitive tasks. We present an implemented PDP model of Event-Related Potential (ERP) data on visual word recognition.

2011,Strategic Resources Support the Interpretation of Doubly-Quantified Sentences,"Quantifiers like ``all'' and ``every'' are frequent in daily language. However, when a sentence contains two quantifiers or is ``doubly-quantified'' (e.g., ``Every boy ate a cookie'') the meaning can often be ambiguous since there are two potential interpretations: collective (e.g., several boys sharing a single cookie) and distributive (e.g., several boys each eating their own cookie). Psycholinguistic studies have established empirical evidence for conflict between interpretations of a doubly-quantified sentence and have proposed that the interpretation of these sentences is ``underspecified''. However, little is known about the the neural mechanisms that support the interpretation of doubly-quantified sentences. In an fMRI experiment we demonstrate that conflict between possible interpretations of doubly-quantified sentences is supported by brain regions situated in fronto-parietal cortex. We propose that an ``underspecified'' account is insufficient to account for our neuroanatomical results and instead argue that strategic decision-making resources may support the interpretation of doubly-quantified sentences.",>Corey McMillan>Neville Ryant>Danielle Coleman>Robin Clark>Murray Grossman,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0577/index.html
2011,Finding neural correlates of drift diffusion processes in EEG oscillations,Recent studies have begun to elucidate the neural correlates of evidence accumulation in perceptual decision making. Few of them have used a combined modeling-electrophysiological approach to studying evidence accumulation. We introduce a novel multivariate approach to EEG analysis with which we can perform a comprehensive search for neural correlates of dynamics predicted by the drift diffusion model. We show that the dynamics of evidence accumulation are correlated with decreases in the 4-9 Hz theta band over the course of a trial. The rate of decrease in this band correlates with individual differences in fitted drift diffusion model parameters.,>Marieke van Vugt>Patrick Simen>Jonathan Cohen,">Department of Artificial Intelligence

2011,The Relation between Finger Gnosis and Mathematical Ability: Can we Attribute Function to Cortical Structure with Cross-Domain Modeling?,"This paper details and applies a novel method for assigning function to local cortical structure. Imaging results from multiple cognitive domains were used to investigate what a shared neural substrate could be contributing to two apparently different domains: finger and number representation. We identified a region within the left precentral gyrus contributing to both tasks; identified, across several cognitive domains, other cognitive uses to which the ROI may have been put; and looked across these cognitive uses to ascertain the functional contribution of the ROI. The result of this process is a proposed local workingan array of pointersthat can be tested empirically and will allow for further elaboration of the redeployment view of the relation between finger and number representations. This work is significant for understanding the relationship between finger gnosis and math, and for introducing cross-domain modeling as a new empirical method.",>Marcie Penner-Wilger>Michael L.

Our model implements the idea that items in visual short-term memory can be encoded at multiple levels of abstraction, where the appropriate levels of abstraction and how much weight should be given to each level can be automatically determined. A capacity limit is implemented in this model by favoring small numbers of clusters of items. We show that various biases and distortions reported in visual short-term recall and recognition memory literatures can be quite naturally and elegantly explained by the model.",>Emin Orhan>Robert Jacobs,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0580/index.html

Recent experimental results indicate that gaze following is not merely an imitation of head movement. We propose that children learn a probabilistic model of the consequences of their movements, and later use this learned model of self as a surrogate for another human. We introduce a Bayesian model where gaze following occurs as a consequence of goal inference in a learned probabilistic graphical model. Bayesian inference over this learned model provides both an estimate of anothers fixation location and the appropriate action to follow their gaze. The model can be regarded as a probabilistic instantiation of Meltzo ffs Like me hypothesis. We present simulation results based on a nonparametric Gaussian process implementation of the model, and compare the models performance to infant gaze following results.",>Abram L. Friesen>Rajesh P.

2011,Bayesian Theory of Mind: Modeling Joint Belief-Desire Attribution,"We present a computational framework for understanding Theory of Mind (ToM): the human capacity for reasoning about agents' mental states such as beliefs and desires. Our Bayesian model of ToM (or BToM) expresses the predictive model of belief- and desire-dependent action at the heart of ToM as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and reconstructs an agent's joint belief state and reward function using Bayesian inference, conditioned on observations of the agent's behavior in some environmental context. We test BToM by showing participants sequences of agents moving in simple spatial scenarios and asking for joint inferences about the agents' desires and beliefs about unobserved aspects of the environment. BToM performs substantially better than two simpler variants: one in which desires are inferred without reference to an agent's beliefs, and another in which beliefs are inferred without reference to the agent's dynamic observations in the environment.",>Chris Baker>Rebecca Saxe>Joshua Tenenbaum,>MIT>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0583/index.html
2011,The Rational Hypocrite: Informal Argumentation and Moral Hypocrisy,"We suggest that in some instances the apparent logical inconsistency of moral hypocrisy stems from different evaluations of a weak argument, rather than dishonesty per se. Extending Corner, Hahn, and Oaksfords (2006) analysis of slippery slope arguments, we propose that inferences of hypocrisy depend on perceived similarity of actions to previous standards. In Experiment 1, dissimilar actions were rated as less hypocritical than their similar counterparts. If observers are choosing between competing theories (i.e., hypocrisy or legitimate dissimilarity), evidence of self-serving motives will positively support inferences of hypocrisy independent of changes in similarity. In Experiment 2, we manipulated potential self-serving interests that an action would produce while keeping similarity between cases identical. Actions that would result in a beneficial outcome for the actor were seen as more hypocritical than their non-self-serving counterparts. These results support the possibility that Bayesian analyses of weak arguments have implications for assessing moral reasoning.",>Tage Rai>Keith Holyoak,>UCLA>UCLA,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0584/index.html
2011,Using Inverse Planning and Theory of Mind for Social Goal Inference,"We propose that human observers can infer that an animated agent has a partial state of belief about its environment and that observers use this information when inferring its goals. We conducted an experiment showing that observers used line-of-sight cues  an agent's orientation relative to various objects in the environment, and the presence or absence of visual obstructions  to determine the content of an agent's state of belief about the location of objects. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that human observers use line-of-sight cues to assign belief states to agents and that these belief states can be used to interpret agent behavior. We found that observer models that incorporated inferences about agents beliefs outperformed an all-knowing observer model in describing human responses. Additionally, we found that human responses were most consistent with the behavior of a model that incorporates information about both orientation and line-of-sight obstructions.",>Sean Tauber>Mark Steyvers,">University of California, Irvine>University of California, Irvine",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0585/index.html

In contrast, we claim that performance depends on task properties such as instruction, training, and procedure of asking for social reasoning. In an experiment based on a two-player game, we manipulated these task properties and found that higher-order theory of mind improved by providing step-by-step instruction and training.

A core question for cognitive science is what mental representations support this ability. We offer one proposal based on the framework of influence diagrams, an extension of Bayes nets that is suited for representing intentional goal-directed agents.

I argue, first, that these studies do not present a challenge to the IEM thesis, and furthermore that IEM is indicative of a fundamental distinction between two ways of being self-awarea distinction that has real consequences for empirical studies of self-awareness. In the final section of the paper I suggest that the non-attributive self-reference (NSR) thesis better explains what is special about the distinction than IEM does by itself.",>Ted Lougheed,>Carleton University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0589/index.html
2011,Moving Beyond Where and What to How: Using Models and fMRI to Understand Brain-Behavior Relations,"One central goal of cognitive science is to understand how the brain supports cognition. Toward this end, a great deal of effort is devoted toward computational modeling and brain imaging. The former effort is well represented at the Annual Conference, whereas the latter effort is neglected. One common criticism of brain imaging research from the cognitive science community is that it is overly focused on the ""where"" of cognition, as opposed to the ""how"" (i.e., process-level questions linking brain and behavior). Model-based analysis of fMRI data links models to the interpretation of imaging data, allowing process-level questions to be asked. The basic approach involves fitting models to behavioral data and then using internal quantities from the models as regressors in the imaging analysis. In this symposium, a broad assortment of leading researchers demonstrate the value of this approach in several domains.",>Bradley Love>John Spencer>Nathaniel Daw>John O'Doherty,>Texas>Iowa>NYU>Caltech,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0590/index.html
2011,Exploring Spaces to Make the Right Choice: The Cognitive Science of Search,"One important question in cognitive science is how humans search for useful resources in the environment. Indeed, understanding the search process is often a critical step for studying how an agent learns, adapts, and behaves in an uncertain environment. More generally, search is required whenever an agent faces a problem and there are uncertainties involved during the process of solving the problem. Given its ubiquity, the search process is found to be central in many cognitive activities, ranging from vision, memory retrieval, problem solving, decision making, web navigation, to social selection. However, research on search has a tendency to fragment into multiple areas. The goal of this symposium is to lead an integrative discussion of the over-arching principles underlying the search process, and highlight how search plays a central role in cognition. To this end, participants in this symposium will present research results that show how humans search in different spaces such as information spaces (Wai-Tat Fu), decision spaces (Thomas Hills), motivational spaces (Art Markman), and social and non-social spaces (Peter Todd).",>Wai-Tat Fu>Thomas Hills,>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>University of Basel,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0591/index.html
2011,How children learn to value numbers: Information structure and the acquisition of numerical understanding,"Although number words are common in everyday speech, for most children, learning these words is an arduous, drawn out process. Here we present a formal, computational analysis of number learning that suggests that the unhelpful structure of the linguistic input available to children may be a large contributor to this delay, and that manipulating this structure should greatly facilitate learning. A training-experiment with three-year olds confirms these predictions, demonstrating that significant, rapid gains in numerical understanding and competence are possible given appropriately structured training. At the same time, the experiment illustrates how little benefit children derive from the usual training that parents and educators provide. Given the efficacy of our intervention, the ease with which it can be adopted by parents, and the large body of research showing how strongly early numerical ability predicts later educational outcomes, this simple discovery could have potentially far-reaching import.",>Michael Ramscar>Melody Dye>Hanna Popick>Fiona O'Donnell-McCarthy,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0592/index.html
2011,A neuroplausible computational model of vision also exhibits asymmetry in developmental category learning,"Computational models are increasingly used to explore possible mechanisms underlying infant capability in various tasks. Often, such models do not work on direct image data, but on hand-computed attributes of the images which are used as input in connectionist models. Such models are open to criticism since computing intermediate features may knowledge unavailable to the infant. Here we to explore the feasibility of the Serre-Poggio model which emulates the cortical ventral stream , and construct infant mental map using probabilistic models. In experiment 1, we consider asymmetry in visual category learning in early infancy (e.g. cats vs dogs), and show that surprisal for the novel category is higher when habituated on cat than on dog. Then we explore the role of face habituation and hierarchical category in categorization. These experiments suggest some mechanisms for the internal structures in infant learning, and also validate the S-P model for such tasks.",>Ankit Gupta Ankit>Devesh Kumar Singh Devesh>Amitabha Mukerjee Mukerjee,>IIT Kanpur>IIT Kanpur>IIT Kanpur,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0593/index.html
2011,Neurophysiological Correlates of Visual Statistical Learning in Adults and Children,"Implicit statistical learning refers to the acquisition of statistical patterns occurring under incidental learning conditions. Although statistical learning is central to the development of many cognitive domains, such as language, its developmental trajectory is largely unspecified. Furthermore, few studies have attempted to examine the underlying neural mechanisms supporting statistical learning, in adults or in children. In this study, we used a novel visual statistical learning paradigm that allowed us to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of learning in adults, older children (aged 9-12), and younger children (aged 6-9). The results depict a nuanced picture of the development of statistical learning, involving the use of two distinct neurocognitive processing mechanisms associated with the N2 and P300 components. In addition, the results suggest that the childrens brains acquired the statistical structure quicker than the adults, with learning-related ERP components emerging after comparably less exposure to the patterns.",>Ethan Jost>Christopher Conway>John Purdy>Michelle Hendricks,>Saint Louis University>Saint Louis University>Saint Louis University>Saint Louis University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0594/index.html
2011,Improving Adaptive Learning Technology through the Use of Response Times,"Adaptive learning techniques have typically scheduled practice using learners' accuracy and item presentation history. We describe an adaptive learning system (Adaptive Response Time Based SequencingARTS) that uses both accuracy and response time (RT) as direct inputs into sequencing. Response times are used to assess learning strength and to determine mastery, making both fluency and accuracy goals of learning. ARTS optimizes spacing by expanding item recurrence intervals as an inverse function of RT. In Experiment 1, we compared ARTS to Atkinsons (1972) Markov model system using geography learning and found substantially greater learning efficiency for ARTS. In Experiment 2, we deployed the system in a real learning setting. Third graders attending an online school mastered basic multiplication facts in about two hours using ARTS, outperforming a control group using standard instruction. These results suggest that response time-based adaptive learning has remarkable potential to enhance learning in many domains.",>Everett Mettler>Christine Massey>Philip Kellman,">University of California, Los Angeles>University of Pennsylvania>University of California, Los Angeles",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0595/index.html
2011,Children's comprehension and production of transitive sentences is sensitive to the causal structure of events,"Young children learn about causal structure not only from observation, but also from the language they hear. Two novel-verb studies show that preschoolers expect transitive sentences like ""Sarah broke the lamp"" to express relationships between cause and effect. Previous work has conflated causation with other semantic features, presenting children with coarse contrasts between scenes varying on multiple dimensions. The current studies used minimal-pair scenes that varied on a single causally-relevant feature, the spatiotemporal contiguity between action and outcome. Preschoolers were more likely to produce transitive descriptions (""She wugged it"") to describe causal versions of events. They also reliably selected causal versions when asked to ""find where she wugged [it]"". Transitive syntax thus provides children with a rich source of evidence about the verbs they learn and the events they encounter in the world.",>Melissa Kline>Jesse Snedeker>Laura Schulz,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Harvard University>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0596/index.html
2011,Acquiring Word Learning Biases,"Previous research has shown that infants can acquire a shape bias in word learning when presented with labels that are perfectly correlated with object shape. However, little research examines whether children can acquire a non-shape word learning bias. Research on inducing this bias can help inform the origins of the shape bias. In our experiment, 3 year-old children successfully acquired a new bias even with relatively few objects and a short training session, illustrating the relevance of the overhypothesis formation account in explaining the acquisition of early inductive constraints.",>Zi Sim>Sylvia Yuan>Fei Xu,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0597/index.html
2011,Early Talkers and Late Talkers Know Nouns that License Different Word Learning Biases,"In typical development, word learning goes from slow and laborious to fast and seemingly effortless. Typically developing 2-year-olds are so skilled at learning noun categories that they seem to intuit the whole range of things in the category from hearing a single instance named  they are biased learners. This is not the case for children below the 20th percentile on productive vocabulary (late talkers). This paper looks at the vocabulary composition of age-matched 18-30-month-old late- and early-talking children. The results of Experiment 1 show that late talkers vocabularies are more variable than early talkers vocabularies. Crucially, Experiment 2 shows that neural networks trained on the vocabularies of individual late talkers learn qualitatively different biases than those trained on early talker vocabularies. These simulations make testable predictions for world learning biases of late- vs. early-talking children. The implications for diagnosis and intervention are discussed.",>Eliana Colunga>Clare Sims,">University of Colorado, Boulder>University of Colorado, Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0598/index.html
2011,When More Evidence Makes Word Learning Less Suspicious,"One challenging problem that children overcome in learning new words is recognizing the hierarchical category of a label. For instance, one object could be called a Dalmatian, a dog, or an animal. Xu and Tenenbaum (2007) proposed a Bayesian model to explain how 3.5 to 5-year-olds solve this ambiguity. They emphasized children's appreciation for suspicious coincidences: a label applied to three identical toys is interpreted more narrowly than a label applied to one toy. Xu and Tenenbaum did not investigate childrens prior category knowledge, however. We replicated their suspicious coincidence effect and measured this knowledge. Unexpectedly, children with more category knowledge appreciated suspicious coincidences less. In a second experiment, repeatedly emphasizing novel labels caused all children to stop recognizing the suspicious coincidence. These data are inconsistent with the Bayesian account and suggest the phenomenon is influenced by subtler aspects of prior knowledge and by task-specific details.",>Gavin Jenkins>Jodi Smith>John Spencer>Larissa Samuelson,">University of Iowa

2011,Estimating scene typicality from human ratings and image features,"Scenes, like objects, are visual entities that can be categorized into functional and semantic groups. One of the core concepts of human categorization is the idea that category membership is graded: some exemplars are more typical than others. Here, we obtain human typicality rankings for more than 120,000 images from 706 scene categories through an online rating task on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We use these rankings to identify the most typical examples of each scene category. Using computational models of scene classification based on global image features, we find that images which are rated as more typical examples of their category are more likely to be classified correctly. This indicates that the most typical scene examples contain the diagnostic visual features that are relevant for their categorization. Objectless, holistic representations of scenes might serve as a good basis for understanding how semantic categories are defined in term of perceptual representations.",>Krista A.

Many authors have proposed that transferred knowledge from more familiar concepts is a route to one shot learning, but what is the form of this abstract knowledge? One hypothesis is that the sharing of parts is core to one shot learning, and we evaluate this idea in the domain of handwritten characters, using a massive new dataset. These simple visual concepts have a rich internal part structure, yet they are particularly tractable for computational models. We introduce a generative model of how characters are composed from strokes, where knowledge from previous characters helps to infer the latent strokes in novel characters. The stroke model outperforms a competing state-of-the-art character model on a challenging one shot learning task, and it provides a good fit to human perceptual data.",>Brenden Lake>Ruslan Salakhutdinov>Jason Gross>Joshua Tenenbaum,>MIT>MIT>MIT>MIT,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0601/index.html

We note that this problem is closely related to classification problems in machine learning, for which standard methods exist, and new methods continue to be developed. Using a large database of associations of features to animal stimuli, made by different people, we test several standard benchmark methods, including nearest neighbor, decision tree, and logistic regression methods. We also apply a new classifier, developed for image processing, which we call Sparse Instance Representation. We show that it is the best-performed, especially when constrained in a novel psychologically interpretable way.

2011,Towards a Law of Human Conceptual Behavior,"Invariance principles underlie many key theories in modern science. They provide the explanatory and predictive framework necessary for the rigorous study of natural phenomena ranging from the structure of crystals, to magnetism, to relativistic mechanics. Vigo (2008, 2009) introduced a new general notion and principle of invariance from which two parameter-free (ratio and exponential) models were derived to account for human conceptual behavior. Here we introduce a new parameterized exponential law based on the same invariance principle. The law accurately predicts the subjective degree of difficulty that humans experience when learning different types of concepts. In addition, it precisely fits the data from a large-scale experiment which examined a total of 84 category structures across 10 category families (R^2=.97, p<.0001; r=.98, p<.0001). Moreover, it overcomes seven key challenges that had, hitherto, been grave obstacles for theories of concept learning.",>Ronaldo Vigo,>Ohio University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0603/index.html
2011,A Preliminary Report on the Effects of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury on Spatial Attention,"The objective of this investigation was to measure subtle disturbances in information processing after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) for spatially presented stimuli as compared to a sample of control participants. Participants completed a temporal order judgment task requiring the correct identification of the order of two asynchronously presented stimuli that were precued either by a peripheral or central cue. Point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) scores demonstrated a dissociation in spatial attentional control. Specifically, deficits for the group with mild TBI were observed for peripheral cues, while volitional attentional control during the centrally cued task was spared, when compared with controls. These data suggest that peripheral distraction strongly captures attention, possibly making disengagement from that location difficult, whereas directed and volitional control over attention is largely spared, as indicated by indistinguishable PSS scores when compared with healthy controls after central cues.",>Scott Sinnett>Ahnate Lim>Jeremy Thacker,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0604/index.html
2011,Computational exploration of the relationship between holistic processing and right hemisphere lateralization in featural and configural recognition tasks,"Holistic processing has long been considered as a property of right hemisphere (RH) processing. Nevertheless, recent studies showed reduced holistic processing and increased RH lateralization in Chinese character recognition expertise, suggesting that these two effects may separate. Through computational modeling, in which we implement a theory of hemispheric asymmetry in perception that posits a low frequency bias in the RH and a high frequency bias in the left hemisphere, we show that when the recognition task relies purely on featural information, holistic processing increases whereas RH lateralization decreases with increasing stimulus similarity; there is a negative correlation between them. In contrast, when the task relies purely on configural information, although RH lateralization negatively correlates with stimulus similarity, holistic processing does not correlate with stimulus similarity; there is a positive correlation between them. This suggests that holistic processing and RH lateralization do not always go together, depending on the task requirements.",>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao>Kloser Chee Fung Cheung,>University of Hong Kong>University of Hong Kong,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0605/index.html
2011,Fortunate Conjunctions Revived: Feature Binding with the 2f-ST2 Model,"Temporal feature binding in vision refers to the process by which features of objects presented one after the other at the same spatial location are correctly bound together. In this paper, we describe a computational model of putative neural mechanisms that would produce this behaviour.

2011,Coexistence of Multiple Modal Dominances,"Research has shown visual dominance effects by participants inclination to focus on visual information when presented with compounded visual and auditory stimuli. A recent study has found auditory dominance through a passive oddball detection task. As this task did not require an explicit response, the first aim of this study was to require a response from the participant. Using a single-response oddball task, Experiment 1 found auditory dominance when examining response times to auditory and visual oddballs, and Experiment 2 confirmed the findings, even when visual stimuli were presented 100 ms prior to auditory. Experiment 3 extended the task to measure error rates, requiring participants to make separate responses for auditory, visual, and bimodal stimuli. Auditory dominance was eliminated with a reversal to visual dominance. The current study provides evidence for the coexistence of multiple sensory dominances. Mechanisms underlying sensory dominance and factors that may modulate sensory dominance are discussed.",>Marvin Chandra>Christopher Robinson>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>The Ohio State University>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0607/index.html
2011,Motivation and Motor Control: Hemispheric Specialization for Motivation Reverses with Handedness,"What is the relationship between action and emotion? People tend to perform approach actions with their dominant hand and avoidance actions with their nondominant hand. In right-handers, the left frontal lobe is specialized for approach-motivational states, and the right frontal lobe for avoidance-motivational states. Are brain areas that support affective motivation functionally related to areas that support approach- and avoidance-related motor actions? If so, hemispheric specialization for motivation should covary with hemispheric specialization for motor control. Here we tested this prediction, using electroencephalography (EEG) to compare resting alpha-band power in right- and left-handers. Hemispheric asymmetries in alpha-power were related to Behavioral Activation System (BAS) scores, which index approach-motivational tendencies. Results show that the pattern observed in right-handers reverses in left-handers, whose right hemisphere is specialized for both approach motivation and for control of dominant-hand actions. This anatomical covariation suggests a functional link between affective motivation and motor control.",>Geoffrey Brookshire>Daniel Casasanto,">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, NL

2011,Searching for cultural influences on the body-specific association of preferred hand and emotional valence,"Prior research has shown that right-handers tend to associate the right side of space with positive ideas and the left side of space with negative ideas, but left-handers associate right with negative and left with positive. No effect of the standard cultural association of right with good was found superimposed on this pattern. Can cultural conventions modulate this body-specific association? Here we compared Spanish and Arab cultures, which differ in the pressure against the left and in favour of the right. In spite of clear indications that cultural pressure against the left is stronger in Arab than Spanish culture, we observed no traces of an increased tendency to associate right with good in Arab righties. So far, there is no evidence for an effect of cultural conventions on the strength of body-specific conceptual associations.",>de la Fuente Juanma>Casasanto Daniel>Román Antonio>Santiago Julio,">Dept. de Psicología Experimental y Fisiología del Comportamiento, Universidad de Granada, Spain>Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands>Dept. de Psicología Experimental y Fisiología del Comportamiento, Universidad de Granada, Spain>Dept. de Psicología Experimental y Fisiología del Comportamiento, Universidad de Granada, Spain",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0609/index.html

This observation underlies many computational models of Referring Expression Generation, especially those influenced by Dale and Reiter's Incremental Algorithm. However, more recent work has shown that in interactive settings, priming can alter preferences. This paper provides further experimental evidence for these phenomena, and proposes a new computational model that incorporates both attribute preferences and priming effects.

This can explain why two people that encounter the same stimulus can behave in very different ways \cite{chomsky59}. For example, an art historian viewing a Jackson Pollock painting may exclaim ``this is beautiful'' due to her representation of his work as a rejection of painting with a brush; however, a lay person may say ``this is ugly'' due to his representation of the painting as a cluttered mess of colors. Without knowledge of the representations of each person in this example, it would be nearly impossible to explain their behavior when interacting with the Jackson Pollock painting.",>Joseph Austerweil>Thomas Griffiths>Todd Gureckis>Robert Goldstone>Kevin Canini>Matt Jones,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley>New York University>Indiana University>University of California, Berkeley>University of Colorado, Boulder",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0613/index.html

Examples may become too bound to their particular context, and individuals may have a difficult time recognizing when the underlying principles are relevant in new situations. In the current study, we provide evidence that contextualization may impair knowledge transfer even when that context occurs outside of the training example itself. Specifically, when students were taught about positive feedback systems in the context of polar ice-albedo effects, those individuals that had previously learned about the effects of global warming on polar bear populations showed reliably poorer transfer performance.",>Samuel B.

2011,Progressive Alignment Facilitates Learning of Deterministic But Not Probabilistic Relational Categories.,"Kotovsky and Gentner (1996) showed that presenting progressively aligned examples helped children discover relational similarities: Comparisons based on initially concrete and highly similar, but progressively more abstract exemplars helped the discovery of higher-order relational similarities. We investigated whether progressive alignment can aid learning of relational categories with either a deterministic (in which one relation reliably predicts category membership) or a probabilistic structure (in which each relation predicts category membership with 75% reliability). Progressive alignment helped participants learn relational categories with the deterministic structure. However, progressive alignment did not help participants learn the probabilistic relational categories. The results show that learning relational categories with a deterministic structure can be improved by progressive alignment, consistent with previous findings (Kotovsky & Gentner, 1996), but also support previous findings suggesting that relational categories are represented as a schemas, which are learned by a process of intersection discovery that fails catastrophically with probabilistic category structures.",>Wookyoung Jung>John Hummel,>U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0615/index.html

Through the use of culturally shared base analogs instead of idiosyncratic ones, we overcame two limitations in their study that preclude such interpretation. Our participants had to propose analogies to dissuade a person from pursuing certain objective. A movie seen in natural settings could serve that purpose. Whereas half of the participants had to retrieve it from a superficially similar target analog, the other half had to retrieve it from a superficially dissimilar one. In line with traditional findings, retrieval of superficially dissimilar sources was scarce and much lower than retrieval of sources maintaining such similarities. Results call into doubt the hypothesis that naturalistic analogical retrieval is less constrained by superficial similarity.",>Máximo Trench>Valeria Olguín>Ricardo Minervino,>Universidad de Buenos Aires-CONICET>Universidad Nacional del Comahue-CONICET>Universidad Nacional del Comahue-CONICET,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0616/index.html
2011,Is Evoking Negative Meanings the Unique Feature of Adjective Metaphors? :Through the Comparison with Nominal Metaphors and Predicative Metaphors,"Previous metaphor studies have paid much attention to nominal and predicative metaphors and little attention has been given to adjective metaphors. Although some studies have focused on adjective metaphors, they have only examined how the acceptability of adjective metaphors can be explained by the pairing of adjective modifiers and head nouns modalities and little attention has been given to meanings evoked by adjective metaphors. Sakamoto & Utsumi (2009) showed that adjective metaphors, especially those modified by color adjectives, tend to evoke negative meanings. Thus, our study examines whether evoking negative meanings is the unique feature of adjective metaphors through the comparison with nominal and predicative metaphors for the Japanese language. Our psychological experiments revealed that meanings of metaphors are basically affected by meanings of vehicles. However, when a vehicle itself has the neutral meaning, negative meanings are evoked more frequently for adjective metaphors among the other types of metaphors.",>Miho Sumihisa>Hiroya Tsukurimichi>Akira Utsumi>Maki Sakamoto,>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications>The University of Electro-Communications,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0617/index.html
2011,Design features of language emerge from general-purpose learning mechanisms,"There are certain universal properties of language that are taken to be definitional to the concept of language itself, such as the arbitrary relationship between sounds and meanings of words. Another possibility is that these design features of language may instead be the expressed consequences of general purpose learning constraints within the cognitive system learning the language. To test this, generations of an inverse model learning to map between sounds and meanings of words was tested. In this model, learning to associate phonology to semantics influences the models production of phonology from semantics, and phonological productions of one model were used as input to the next generation. Over generations of the models learning, the language became easier to acquire, and demonstrated increased arbitrariness of mappings between phonology and semantics. The iterative modelling demonstrated that design features of natural language can spontaneously emerge in a general purpose learning system.",>Padraic Monaghan,>Lancaster University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0618/index.html

In the present study we examine whether a Zipfian frequency distribution influences adult learners' word segmentation performance. Using two experimental paradigms (a forced choice task and an orthographic segmentation task), we show that human statistical learning abilities are robust enough to identify words from exposures with widely varying frequency distributions. Additionally, we report a facilitatory effect of Zipfian distributions on word segmentation performance in the orthographic segmentation task, both in segmenting trained material and in generalization to novel material.

This approach views linguistic knowledge as hierarchically organized such that the outcome of acquisition includes not only specific language knowledge, but also beliefs about how any language is likely to be structured. We test predictions regarding how two key types of information come together to drive L2 learning: distributional information and generalization bias derived from existing knowledge of language. We trained monolingual English speakers in a distributional learning paradigm on a novel contrast, segmental length, and tested them on categorization of short/long segments for trained and untrained items. Results show both learning and generalization from one class of segments to another, providing evidence for our approach to L2 learning as one of inductive inference and generalization rather than of mapping.",>Bozena Pajak>Roger Levy,>UC San Diego>UC San Diego,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0620/index.html

Participants heard and spoke sequences of syllables featuring novel phonotactic constraints (e.g. /f/ is always a syllable onset, /s/ is always a syllable coda). Participants speech errors reflected weaker learning of the constraints present in the spoken sequences (e.g. /f/ must be onset) when they heard sequences with the inverse constraints (e.g. /f/ must be coda), suggesting that the constraints experienced in perception interfered with learning in production. The results did not depend on the presence of a shared orthographic code in perception and production trials, suggesting that direct transfer between heard speech and produced speech is possible, perhaps through prediction via inner speech. Further work is needed to determine the exact mechanism supporting inter-modality transfer of phonological generalizations.",>Audrey K. Kittredge>Gary S.

2011,Look No Goals!: A Sufficient Model of Simple Algebra Problem Solving Without Explicit Goal Representation,"Theories of cognitive control suggest that goal representation is both amodal and specialized. The GLAM-PS (Glamorgan Problem Solver) Cognitive Architecture has no specialised goal representation or goal handling. In addition, GLAM-PS, a distributed production system theory, does not use amodal representation (it is an embodied/grounded architecture). The current paper demonstrates that it is, nevertheless, possible to model off-line and abstract problem solving within GLAM-PS. A model of linear equation solving is presented. The processes used by the model to solve equations are described in detail, with a particular focus on the way control of thought and action is achieved. Instead of goals, the models problem solving is guided by the use of naturally occurring control states derived from existing internal and external representations. The conclusion that specialized goal representation isnt needed may also apply to architectures using amodal as well as modal representation (e.g. J. R. Andersons ACT-r, 2007).",>Gareth Miles,">University of Glamorgan, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0623/index.html
2011,Local statistical learning under cross-situational uncertainty,"Statistical learning research often assumes that learners collect global statistics across the entire set of stimuli they are exposed to. In naturalistic settings, this assumption of global access to training data is problematic because it implies that the cognitive system must keep track of an exponentially growing number of relations while determining which of those relations is significant. We investigated a more plausible assumption, namely that learning proceeds incrementally, using small windows of opportunity in which the relevant relations are assumed to hold over temporally contiguous objects or events. This local statistical learning hypothesis was tested on the learning of novel word-to-world mappings under conditions of uncertainty. Results suggest that temporal contiguity and contrast are effective in multimodal learning, and that the order of presentation of data can therefore make a significant difference.",>Luca Onnis>Shimon Edelman>Heidi Waterfall,">Department of Second Language Studies, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA

We find that context--the meaningfulness of the observations--plays a significant role in the rate of human RL.

2011,Use of Complementary Actions Decreases with Expertise,"Based on data collected during play of the fast-paced video game of Tetris, it has long been claimed that complementary (or epistemic) actions increase with expertise (Kirsh, 1995; Kirsh & Maglio, 1994; Maglio & Kirsh, 1996). Complementary actions use the environment to provide information that would otherwise require mental processing. They stand in contrast to pragmatic actions, which operate to bring the current state closer to the goal state. Although complementary actions undoubtedly exist, we question the conclusion that they increase with expertise. First, classifying actions made in a fast-paced video game can be very difficult. Second, the range of expertise considered in prior studies has been very small. We sample a wide range of Tetris expertise and define complementary actions across multiple criterion of varying strictness. Contrary to prior work, our data suggest that complementary actions decrease with expertise, regardless of the criterion used.",>Marc Destefano>John K. Lindstedt>Wayne D.

Parkinsons gait consists of random disconnected strides, whereas stride times in healthy gait have a 1/f fractal structure. Fixed-tempo Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) improves many aspects of gait timing, but stride-times become less correlated. In this experiment, PD patients and healthy participants walked with a) no auditory stimulation; b) fixed-tempo RAS; and c) an interactive rhythmic auditory stimulation computer system that used foot sensors and nonlinear oscillators to track and interact with the humans timing. Patients effortlessly synchronized with the interactive system, and their fractal scaling returned to levels of healthy participants. When patients and healthy participants did synchronize with the fixed-tempo RAS, their fractal scaling declined away from healthy 1/f levels. Higher fractal scaling persisted after interactive rhythmic stimulation indicating that internal rhythms stabilized.

The present study tested this hypothesis and examined some of the underlying factors. Texts in real-world scenes were compared with paired control regions of similar size, eccentricity, and low-level visual saliency. The greater fixation probability and shorter minimum fixation distance of texts showed their higher attractiveness. These results might be caused by the prominent locations or special visual features of text. In another experiment, texts were removed from the scenes, and the results indicated that the locations that used to contain texts did draw more attention than controls. Finally, texts were placed in unexpected positions in front of homogeneous and inhomogeneous backgrounds. These unconstrained texts were found more attractive than controls, with background noise reducing this difference, which indicates that the attraction by specific visual features of text was superior to typical saliency.",>Hsueh-Cheng Wang>Marc Pomplun,>University of Massachusetts at Boston>University of Massachusetts at Boston,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0630/index.html

2011,Speaker gaze affects utterance comprehension beyond visual attention shifts,"Previous research has shown that listeners follow speaker gaze to mentioned objects in a shared visual environment to ground referring expressions, both for human and robot speakers. What is less clear is whether listeners exploit speaker gaze to infer referential intentions (Staudte & Crocker, 2010), or whether benefits of gaze can be more simply explained by (reflexive) gaze following (Friesen & Kingstone, 1998). To investigate this issue, we conducted two eye-tracking studies which directly contrast speech-aligned speaker gaze of a virtual agent with an arrow. Our findings show that speaker gaze is beneficial to listeners only when the order of gaze cues matched the order of mentioned objects in the utterance. Similarly timed arrow cues, however, benefit listeners regardless of this order. These findings are consistent with the view that gaze is interpreted as reflecting the speakers referential intentions, while other visual and referential cues can be exploited more flexibly.",>Maria Staudte>Matthew Crocker>Alexis Heloir>Michael Kipp,">Department of Computational Linguistics, Saarland University>Department of Computational Linguistics, Saarland University>EMBOTS Group, DFKI Saarbruecken>EMBOTS Group, DFKI Saarbruecken",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0632/index.html

Using an eye tracker, 6- to 8-month-old infants were familiarized and tested with a novel visual category where only half of the features were relevant for category membership. There was some evidence that infants learned the target category only when objects were not labeled. Furthermore, infants who learned the target category did not appear to optimize their attention to the category relevant features.

Such simplification strategies can be seen in route planning situations, such as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and tour planning. The present study extends this work by examining a situation where memory demands must be considered during route planning -- planning a running route through an unfamiliar area. Results of routes planned on maps in grid-like and non-grid-like environments suggest that the planned routes reflect aspects of cognitive simplification to meet memory demands. This was evident in both global and local features of the routes. Globally, route trajectories tended towards simple shapes in accord with the affordances of the environment. Locally, changes of direction were preferably chosen at landmarks. More demanding (non-grid) environments led to an increase in simplification strategy use, such as relying on major roads, and avoiding complex decision points.",>Holly A.

Twenty-two participants repeatedly walked through a multicorridor virtual environment, presented via head-mounted display. At several stages within the learning process they were teleported to locations along the route and asked to self-localize and point to other locations. Pointing was faster during later tests as well as for closer targets, both of which might require less integration. In a control group, the same exposure to the environment, but without testing, did not yield this reduced pointing latency. These results are inconsistent with the assumption that participants had already integrated spatial information within a single reference frame during learning and simply accessed this information during testing. Rather, spatial integration is a time consuming process which is not necessarily undertaken if not required.",>Agnes Henson>Hanspeter Mallot>Heinrich Bülthoff>Tobias Meilinger,">Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics>Cognitive Neuroscience, Eberhard-Karls-University Tübingen>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics

2011,Navigation strategy as a predictor of navigation performance,"Navigation strategy is an important component of spatial navigation. In the present study, we developed an assessment of human navigation strategy using a virtual analog of an assessment of animal navigation strategy. We examined the relationship between age, sex, and navigation strategy preference on subsequent performance of the virtual Morris Water Task (vMWT). On our novel assessment of navigation strategy, individuals were highly consistent in preferring either an allocentric or egocentric strategy. There were also substantial group differences in strategy preference with older adults overwhelmingly preferring an egocentric strategy, while younger adults were evenly divided between strategies.

2011,Sex Differences in Brain Activation During Virtual Navigation: A Functional MRI Study,"A male advantage is often reported for measures of visuospatial performance, including measures of spatial navigation; however, few papers have addressed sex differences in brain activity during performance of these navigation tasks. We used functional MRI to compare the brain activation between young adult men and women during performance in a virtual environment (VE). Men and women did not differ in performance, but sex differences were apparent in the functional neuroanatomical correlates of navigation. In particular there was increased activation of the posterior cingulate retrosplenial cortex in men, and, in women with perfect recall performance, increased activation of the parahippocampal gyrus. These two areas are keys to successful navigation. Our results demonstrate that even when men and woman are well-matched on navigation performance, they appear to use different brain mechanisms to achieve the same behavioral end point.",>Nicole Nowak>Susan Resnick>Wendy Elkins>Scott Moffat,>Wayne State University Psychology>National Institute on Aging>National Institute on Aging>Wayne State University Psychology and Institute of Gerontology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0638/index.html
2011,Explanation Effects Override Formal Category Definitions In Clinical Experts Diagnostic Judgments,"Having a plausible life-event explanation for a persons disordered symptoms leads clinicians to judge those symptoms to be less abnormal than if their cause was unknown (Ahn et al., 2003). Yet the American Psychiatric Associations official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders formally states that only bereavement-related life events should exclude a client from a diagnosis of depression, and this bereavement exclusion criterion is slated to be eliminated altogether from the next edition (under development) of the manual. We asked whether clinicians make diagnoses in the context of life-event explanations in direct opposition to these formal prescriptive definitions. We asked clinical psychologists to give diagnostic and other clinical judgments for realistic case study vignettes including a bereavement event, negative non-bereavement event, neutral event, or no event. Both bereavement and non-bereavement life events normalized clinicians perceptions of depression, indicating a clear departure from both the current and proposed DSM.",>Nancy Kim>Thao Nguyen>Daniel Paulus,>Northeastern University>Northeastern University>Northeastern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0639/index.html
2011,Effects of information comprehensibility and argument type on lay recipients readiness to defer to experts when deciding about scientific knowledge claims,"The present study investigated whether laypersons are aware of their own knowledge limitations when having to decide about the acceptability of scientific knowledge claims. Specifically, we tested whether laypeople are more prone to discount their actual dependence on experts after having read simplified science depictions. Lay recipients read scientific arguments varying in comprehensibility and argument type and thus in apparent easiness. We assessed participants inclination to rely on their own information evaluation rather than to seek out expert advice when deciding about claim acceptability. As expected, results showed lay recipients to be more confident in their own information evaluation and less inclined to turn to an expert for decision support after reading easy compared to difficult depictions.",>Rainer Bromme>Lisa Scharrer>M.

We explored whether this description-experience gap could be explained as a difference in probabilistic mindset, that is, the explicit consideration of probability information in the former but not the latter. We replicated the gap but found little evidence to support our main hypothesis.

Employing a simple card selection task to study exploitation and exploration, we find that the total resources accrued, the number of switches between exploring and exploiting, and the number of trials until stable exploitation becomes more similar to those of the optimal strategy as experience increases across searches. Subjects learned to adjust their effective (implicit) thresholds for exploitation toward the optimal threshold over 30 searches. Those implicit thresholds decrease over turns within each search, just as the optimal threshold does, but subjects explicitly stated exploitation threshold increases over turns. Nonetheless, both the explicit and learned implicit thresholds produced performance close to optimal.",>Ke Sang>Peter Todd>Robert Goldstone,">Cognitive Science Program Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences

2011,Allocation of Attention in Classroom Environments: Consequences for Learning,"The current study investigates how young children allocate their attention in learning environments. Prior research has shown that elementary school students spend between 25%-50% of instructional time off-task. However, the available research has not clearly identified the common sources of distraction, nor specified the relationship between the distraction source and learning outcomes. In this study we examined how visual features of the environment which are not relevant for on-going instruction (e.g., manipulatives, posters, artwork, etc.) affect childrens ability to maintain focused attention to the content of a lesson. We addressed this question by experimentally manipulating our laboratory classroom environment (e.g., introducing or removing educational materials irrelevant to the current lesson). The effects of the manipulation on childrens off-task behavior and learning were measured. Results suggested that children in the Low Visual Distraction condition spent less time off-task and obtained higher learning scores than children in the High Visual Distraction condition.",>Karrie Godwin>Anna Fisher,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0643/index.html

Experiment 2 examined if it was necessary for students to generate solutions or can these solutions be simply given to the students to study and evaluate. Experiment 3 examined if it was necessary for students to generate solutions before receiving the critical features of the targeted concept, or could the critical features simply be told. In Experiment 1, PF students significantly outperformed DI students on data analysis and conceptual insight items. In Experiment 2, only the effects on conceptual insight and near transfer were significant. In Experiment 3, only the effect on conceptual insight remained significant.

2011,Distinguishing Levels of Grounding that Underlie Transfer of Learning,"We find that transfer of learning from a perceptually concrete simulation to an isomorphic but superficially dissimilar text-based problem is sensitive to the congruence between the force dynamics common to both systems and the kinesthetic schema induced via action in the first, perceptually concrete, simulation. Counterintuitively, incompatibility between the force dynamics and the kinesthetic schema has a beneficial effect on transfer, relative to compatibility as well as an unrelated control. We suggest that this incompatibility between action and system dynamics may make the systems relational structure more salient, leading to a more flexible conceptualization that ultimately benefits transfer. In addition, we suggest that too much action concreteness in hands-on learning may actually limit transfer, by fostering an understanding that is tied to that action and therefore less available for transfer in situations where that action is no longer relevant.",>Lisa Byrge>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0645/index.html
2011,Outcomes and Mechanisms of Transfer in Invention Activities,"Invention activities are structured tasks in which students create mathematical methods that attempt to capture deep properties of data (e.g., variability), prior to receiving instruction on canonical methods (e.g., mean deviation). While experiments have demonstrated the learning benefits of invention activities, the mechanisms of transfer remain unknown. We address this question by evaluating the role of design in invention activities, identifying what knowledge is acquired during invention activities, and how it is applied in transfer tasks. A classroom experiment with 92 students compared the full invention process to one in which students evaluate predesigned methods. Results show that students in the full invention condition acquired more adaptive knowledge, yet not necessarily better procedural knowledge or invention skills. We suggest a mechanism that explains what knowledge invention attempts produce, how that knowledge is productively modified in subsequent instruction, and how it improves performance on some measures of transfer but not others.",>Ido Roll>Vincent Aleven>Ken Koedinger,>University of British Columbia>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0646/index.html

The QP similarity model can predict such violations, on the basis of the same underlying intuitions as Tversky (1977).

Subjects were rewarded for touching a hidden circular target based on visual cues to the targets location. The cues were 'dots' drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered on the middle of the target. Subjects could sample as many cues as they wished, but the potential reward for hitting the target decreased by a fixed amount for each additional cue requested. The subjects' objective was to balance the benefits of increased information against the costs incurred in acquiring it. We compared human performance to ideal and found that subjects sampled more cues than dictated by the optimal stopping rule that tries to maximize expected gain. We contrast our results with recent reports in the literature that subjects typically under-sample.",>Mordechai Juni>Todd Gureckis>Laurence Maloney,>New York University>New York University>New York University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0651/index.html
2011,Time-interval statistics adaptively modulate decision makers' willingness to wait for delayed outcomes,"The present work examines persistence in situations where delays are open-ended. From a normative standpoint, appropriate behavior in such situations depends on the statistical distribution of possible delay lengths. Depending on this distribution it may be appropriate either to persist indefinitely or to give up after a short period of time. In a behavioral experiment, human participants experienced reward timing statistics that implied it was productive to adopt either a high or low level of persistence. Human decision makers were highly responsive to these statistical cues. In a condition where timing statistics implied patience was productive, participants performed exceptionally well, and had little difficulty in waiting for delayed outcomes. In contrast, participants showed substantially lower willingness to wait when temporal statistics implied patience was an inappropriate strategy. The results demonstrate that seemingly impatient behavior can arise as an adaptive response to the perceived statistics of the environment.",>Joseph McGuire>Joseph Kable,>University of Pennsylvania>University of Pennsylvania,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0652/index.html

In the present study, participants recalled lists of words, after having assessed each for its pleasantness. Presentation position of a negative item within the lists was manipulated. Also, items memorability was manipulated after their presentation  by inserting a filled delay between presentation and the judgment task; in this way, on-line judgment formation was spared. The memory manipulation reduced recall rates for negative items presented in the last position  and their negative influence on pleasantness ratings accordingly. These results contradict the predictions of pure on-line approaches to judgment formation (e.g., Betsch, Plessner, Schwieren, & Gütig, 2001) and suggest that even in on-line judgment tasks, memory plays a role.",>Silvio Aldrovandi>Marie Poirier>Petko Kusev>Daniel Heussen>Peter Ayton,">University of Warwick, UK>City University, UK>Kingston University, UK>University of Leuven, Belgium>City University, UK",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0653/index.html
2011,Temporal Shifts in Perceived Similarity Affect Consumer Valuation and Choice,"Building on research that examines the nature of similarity processes, we suggest that (i) assessments of the similarity between objects shifts systematically depending on the basis used to evaluate similarity, which is influenced by contextual factors; (ii) judgments and choices can be affected by the perceived similarity relations between items in a set; and (iii) such shifts in similarity can therefore play a key role in inferences impacting valuation and choice. In three studies, we show that changes in temporal framing (near future vs. distant future) impact evaluation and choice due to shifts in the basis of perceived similarity, leading to effects that would otherwise be unanticipated. In particular, we find that manipulating temporal context impacts evaluation and choice via its influence on which attributes form the basis of perceived similarity between choice alternatives, in addition to any direct influence it might have on preferences.",>Oleg Urminsky>Daniel Bartels,>University of Chicago>Columbia University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0654/index.html
2011,The Nature of Mental Images - An Integrative Computational Theory,"We shed new light on the long-debated question about the nature of mental images, that is, the underlying structures and processes, with a new theory of mental imagery. This theory is formalized as a computational cognitive model and provides an integrated account of the three prevalent theories of mental imagery, i.e., the descriptive, the quasi-pictorial, and the enactive theory. It does so by offering a consistent explanation for a set of empirical results, which are not plausibly provided by any of the theories individually. We give a brief review of the three theories and summarize their core commitments from a computational modeling perspective. We present a set of empirical results, the different explanations offered by the three theories, and deficiencies of their explanations. The proposed theory and model are introduced and the model's explanatory power is evaluated using the previously identified set of phenomena.",>Jan Frederik Sima,">Cognitive Systems

2011,Simulating Realism in Language Comprehension,"Do perceptual simulations look more like high-resolution photographs or sketchy line drawings? In language comprehension, considerable evidence suggests that words and sentences trigger simulations, but it is unclear to what extent they resemble perceptual reality. We explored the possibility that different types of language may be associated with simulations at different levels of realism. In Experiment 1, participants judged whether an object depicted in a photograph or line drawing had been mentioned in a preceding sentence. Object recognition was faster for photographs after sentences containing adjectives than sentences containing spatial terms, and this difference was greater than for line drawings. In Experiment 2, recognition performance for color drawings was intermediate to that of photographs and line drawings, pointing to a continuum of realism from schematic to photorealistic. The results suggest that language, by eliciting simulations capturing different levels of realism, may induce different ways of conceptualizing the world.",>Kevin J.

2011,Partial Representations of Scenes in Change Blindness: In the Eyes and in the Hands,Change blindness is a persons inability to notice changes in a visual scene that seem obvious when pointed out. Recent experiments using eye tracking techniques have suggested that even though participants do not detect a change they fixate on the changing area more. Two studies test whether this finding is present across different change blindness paradigms and whether it is detectable after fixation. In the first study we compare behavior in flicker and gradual change paradigms. Results reveal that across paradigms participants do spend more time on the changing area yet do not detect the change. In the second study we test whether we can capture the traces of change blindness in mouse movement. Findings indicate that accuracy has more of an impact on mouse movement than presence of change.,>Nick Benesh>Brent Fonville>Rick Dale,">University of Memphis

2011,Thinking for Seeing: Enculturation of Visual-Referential Expertise as Demonstrated by Photo-Triggered Perceptual Reorganization of Two-Tone Mooney Images,"Two-tones (Mooney-esque transformations of grayscale photographs) can be difficult to recognize. However, after viewing a photo cue, adults experience rapid perceptual reorganization, and the two-tones become immediately recognizable. In contrast to adults, preschool-aged children are generally unable to recognize two-tone images even when the photograph is simultaneously available. While simple instructional and perceptual interventions were ineffective, a cognitive intervention in which children were convinced that the photo and two-tone images were transformations of the same physical object improved childrens recognition. We found a similar deficit in recognition in adults from a hunter-gatherer tribe (Pirahã) with a sparse visual symbolic culture and limited exposure to modern visual media. Photo-triggered perceptual reorganization of two-tone images may therefore be a product of prolonged enculturation, reflecting visual-referential expertise. As we gain skill in representing visual correspondences, one of the surprising consequences may be the ability to literally see things we couldnt see before.",>Jennifer M.D. Yoon>Nathan Witthoft>Jonathan Winawer>Michael C.

Humans, in addition, represent the world propositionally and conceptually (perspectivally), and they reason about it recursively and reflectively. The Shared Intentionality Hypothesis posits that these uniquely human forms of cognitive representation and reasoning emerged evolutionarily as cognitive adaptations for dealing with a distinctive form of social life, specifically, one in which individuals had to coordinate their intentional states with others in cooperative, and ultimately cultural, activities. Within these cooperative activities, early humans created shared realities (joint attention, common ground), which then enabled them to direct the attention and imagination of one another in relevant ways in acts of cooperative, and ultimately conventional, communication. Learning to cooperate and communicate within a cultural group during ontogeny creates uniquely human propositional-conceptual-reflective cognition.",>Michael Tomasello,">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology

2011,Mapping alignable or nonalignable differences between domains affects idea quality during analogical problem solving,"Research reported by Sifonis (2008) has demonstrated that the type of comparison made during analogical problem solving affects the quality of the ideas generated. Ideas generated by mapping the differences between domains are rated as less practical than ideas generated by mapping similarities between domains. However, ideas generated by mapping the differences between domains are more creative than ideas generated by mapping the similarities. The current study examines whether these effects of comparison could be due to mapping alignable or nonalignable differences between domains. The data used in the Sifonis (2008) study were examined to determine whether participants used alignable or nonalignable differences between domains to generate ideas for the source domain. Analyses indicated that ideas generated using alignable differences are more practical than ideas generated using nonalignable differences. Ideas generated using nonalignable differences are more creative than ideas using alignable differences. Practical applications of these findings will be discussed.",>Cynthia Sifonis,>Oakland University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0660/index.html
2011,On the Emergence of Analogical Inference,"What processes and mechanisms underlie analogical reasoning? In recent years, several computational models of analogy have been implemented to explore this question. One feature of many of these models is the assumption that humans possess dedicated analogy-specific cognitive machinery  for instance, a mapping or binding engine. In this paper, we question whether it is necessary to assume the existence of such machinery. We find that at least for some types of analogy, it is not. Instead, some forms of analogical processing emerge naturally and spontaneously from relatively simple, low-level learning mechanisms. We argue that this perspective is consistent with empirical findings from the developmental literature and with recent advances in cognitive neuroscience.",>Paul Thibodeau>Stephen Flusberg>Jeremy Glick>Daniel Sternberg,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0661/index.html

In spatially rich domains like geoscience, visual depictions of both the base and target concepts of text analogies (i.e. visual analogies) may provide crucial support for students. To test whether visual analogies would be beneficial for learning, 72 fourth- and fifth-grade students were provided a short analogy-enhanced instructional text on plate tectonics that included either pictures of both the base and target concepts (Visual Analogy condition) or the pictures of the target concept only (Target Picture condition). Results indicated that children in the Visual Analogy condition outperformed children in the Target Picture condition on both near and far transfer measures.

To construct utterances, it uses analogical retrieval to find semantically similar utterances and generalizations, and constructs a new sentence by analogy to them.

The interaction between physiology, sociality and cognition evinces the need to examine this ability throughout the primate order and across different stages of performance. Zoo-living gorillas (n=3) and chimpanzees (n=3) learned to order progressively-built lists of 3,4, and 5 symbols on a touchscreen computer. While performance increased on longer lists for both species (F=20.1, p<0.001), overall gorillas performed more accurately (F=149.1, p<0.001) and exhibited longer response latencies (F=89.2, p<0.001) compared to chimpanzees. Task errors most frequently comprised selection of the symbol associated with the next ordinal position (F=124.3, p<0.001).

2011,A Non-Phylogenetic Conceptual Network Architecture for Organizing Classes of Material Artifacts into Cultural Lineages,"The application of phylogenetic techniques to the documentation of cultural history can present a distorted picture due to horizontal transmission and blending. Moreover, the units of cultural transmission must be communicable concepts, rather than conveniently measurable attributes, and relatedness between elements of culture often resides at the conceptual level, something not captured by phylogenetic methods, which focus on measurable attributes. (For example, mortars and pestles are as related as two artifacts could be, despite little similarity at the attribute level.) This paper introduces a new, cognitively inspired framework for chronicling material cultural history, building on Lipos (2005) network-based computational approach. We show that by incorporating not just superficial attributes of artifact samples (e.g. fluting) but also conceptual knowledge (e.g. information about function), a different pattern of cultural ancestry emerges.",>Liane Gabora>Stefan Leijnen>Tomas Veloz>Carl Lipo,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia>California State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0665/index.html
2011,Shifting attention to a thought: electroencephalographic dynamics during a modified word generation task.,"What happens if you are asked to come up with a word that includes the letters R, B and F in it? Does the answer pop up spontaneously? Or do you somehow actively orient yourself towards your thoughts, searching for a possible match? In other words: does voluntarily thinking about something involve first an attentional shift? Here we approach this question using electroencephalographic recordings in a modified word-generation task. Modulation of early visual event-related potentials to an attentional probe presented before subjects find the target word, indicates that thinking voluntarily about something requires a certain amount of withdrawal of attention from the immediate external context. Fronto-parietal activity during the initial phase of the task suggests that a supra-modal attentional network is involved when one voluntarily orients to a relevant aspect of experience, regardless of whether this is external, in the environment, or internal, in one's mental space.",>Diego Cosmelli>Cristobal Moenne>Hernán Labbé>Karim Jerbi>Vladimir López>Francisco Aboitiz,">Escuela de Psicología, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile

2011,Bridging Visual and Executive Attention,"Attention is divided by scholars such as Parasuraman (2000) into loosely related kinds of attention, such as visual attention and executive attention. The distinction between exogeneity and endogeneity is well-known in visual attention work, such as Prinzmetal's (2009) finding that exogenous and endogenous cues had opposite interactions with search task difficulty. In a new experiment, we examined this effect by introducing multiple levels of stimulus-onset asynchrony to cues. Our work has implications for other forms of attention: another experiment investigates the effect of exogenous/endogenous cues on a decision-making task requiring executive attention. Prinzmetal proposed voluntary and involuntary mechanisms at work in visual attention; we propose that these mechanisms should be extended to higher-level attentional processes as well. While the standard taxonomy is ambiguous about connections between attentional processes, we may be able to understand attention in general with a unified approach drawing upon commonalities between different sorts of attention.",>Jesse Edelstein>Evan Heit,">Cognitive and Information Sciences, University of California, Merced>Cognitive and Information Sciences, University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0667/index.html
2011,The Attentional Blink is Modulated by First Target Contrast: Implications of an Attention Capture Hypothesis,"When two targets (T1 & T2) are presented in rapid succession, observers often fail to report T2 if they attend to T1. The bottleneck theory proposes that this attentional blink (AB) is due to T1 occupying a slow processing stage when T2 is presented. Accordingly, if increasing T1 difficulty increases T1 processing time, this should cause a greater AB. The attention capture hypothesis suggests that T1 captures attention, which cannot be reallocated to T2 in time. Accordingly, if increasing T1 difficulty decreases T1 saliency, this should cause a smaller AB. In two experiments we find support for an attention capture hypothesis. In Experiment 1 we find that AB magnitude increases with T1 contrast  but only when T1 is unmasked. In Experiment 2 we add Gaussian noise to targets and vary T1 contrast but keep T1s SNR constant. Again we find that AB magnitude increases with T1 contrast.",>Simon Nielsen>Tobias Andersen,">Cognitive Systems Section,

2011,The Effects of Peripheral and Central Distraction on the Spatial Attention of Video Game Players,"Previous research indicates that when judging the temporal order of peripherally cued stimuli, video game players (VGPs) attention is captured by the peripheral cue to a larger extent than non-video game players (NVGPs). However, it could also be argued that VGPs should be less distracted by peripheral cues as they have been shown to process and respond to visual information more quickly and accurately than NVGPs, therefore requiring less time between two stimuli to accurately judge the order of occurrence. The present research expands on this by using peripheral and central cues in a temporal order judgment task. Contrary to previous findings, VGPs had smaller PSS scores in both peripheral and central conditions when compared with NVGPs. These findings demonstrate that action VGPs are less sensitive to the effects of distracting information and are not as susceptible to attentional capture as previously suggested.",>Coty Gonzales>Ahnate Lim>Scott Sinnett,>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa>University of Hawaii at Manoa,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0670/index.html
2011,A Generative Model of Causal Cycles,"Causal graphical models (CGMs) have become popular in nu-merous domains of psychological research for representing peoples causal knowledge. Unfortunately, however, the CGMs typically used in cognitive models prohibit representations of causal cycles. Building on work in machine learning, we pro-pose an extension of CGMs that allows cycles and apply that representation to one real-world reasoning task, namely, classi-fication. Our models predictions were assessed in experiments that tested both probabilistic and deterministic causal relations. The results were qualitatively consistent with the predictions of our model and inconsistent with those of an alternative model.",>Bob Rehder>Jay B.

2011,Exploring the influence of particle filter parameters on order effects in causal learning,"The order in which people observe data has an effect on their subsequent judgments and inferences. While Bayesian models of cognition have had success in predicting human inferences, most of these models do not produce order effects, being unaffected by the order in which data are observed. Recent work has explored approximations to Bayesian inference that make the underlying computations tractable, and also produce order effects in a way that seems consistent with human behavior. One of the most popular approximations of this kind is a sequential Monte Carlo method known as a particle filter. However, there has not been a systematic investigation of how the parameters of a particle filter influence its predictions. In this paper, we use a causal learning task as the basis for an investigation of these issues and we demonstrate that different order effects can result from varying the parameters of a particle filter.",>Joshua T.

The results showed no significant differences between groups on CRAT. However, the children with DCD scored significantly lower on the writing subtests of the BRWTB (copying a word and copying a short paragraph from a textbook) than TD children (13.0 ± 5.2 vs. 15.3 ± 5.3; 46.2 ± 22.6 vs. 50.1 ± 20.1). Children with DCD in Taiwan did not have poorer reading ability than TD children. However, they showed poorer writing ability.

2011,Using Web Corpus Statistics to Infer Conceptual Structure,"The basic level is the level of conceptual structure at which categories are maximally informative. In this research, we investigated whether the privileged status of the basic level might be captured by the statistical properties of the Web. Using Googles Web search programming interface, we found that frequency ratios for terms across three levels of abstraction (superordinate, basic, and subordinate) significantly predicted human participants spontaneous labeling of images obtained via Mechanical Turk. Specifically, the Web statistics paralleled participants preference for superordinate labels for natural kinds (e.g., trees, fish) and basic-level labels for other categories. Further, analyses of genre-specific text from the Corpus of Contemporary American English revealed that childrens texts were significantly more predictive than academic texts. Our findings suggest that distributional statistics from subsets of the Web can be used to infer properties of conceptual structure, potentially offering a powerful, high-resolution, yet low-cost tool for empirically testing theoretical predictions.",>Brandon M.

In our study, one group of participants learned novel categories of tropical fish, an exposure group viewed the same stimuli without learning any categories, and a control group did not see the stimuli. All three groups then viewed a sequence of quadruples of fish while their EEG was recorded. In half the quadruples (different), the first three fish were from one category and the fourth was from the other, while in the other half (same), all four fish were from the same category. All three groups also rated the similarity of many pairs of stimuli.

2011,For the price of a song: How pitch category learning comes at a cost to absolute frequency representations,"Appreciating music is cognitively demanding: listeners must learn to divide a continuous space of sound into culturally defined, discrete categories, and maintain a high degree of accuracy in their representations of those sounds. Here, we present a formal analysis of pitch category learning that reveals the trade-offs associated with learning the relative pitch categories that make music possible. Consistent with this, an empirical study reveals how under normal circumstances, peoples ability to represent absolute frequency information is lost as a consequence of the learning processes that facilitate relative pitch acquisition, a finding which may help explain the rarity of absolute pitch among the general population. Understanding the contradictory computational demands of conceptual and perceptual learning can inform the design of musical training and may offer insight into the development of phonological categories in language.",>Melody Dye>Michael Ramscar>Edward Suh,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0678/index.html

Specifically, alternation between exemplars of two categories has been shown to improve category learning and discrimination, compared to presenting exemplars of each category in separate blocks. However, the mechanisms underlying order effects are still not completely known. Remaining issues pertain to the relevance of within and between category similarities, and the role of comparing sequentially presented objects. We present two experiments: in Experiment 1 within- and between-category similarity are manipulated simultaneously with presentation schedule. In Experiment 2, alternation between categories is compared to two blocked conditions: one in which very similar stimuli are presented successively, and another in which they are dissimilar. Our results show a clear overall advantage of low similarity in categorization performance, but no effect of presentation schedule. Also, alternation between categories is shown to result in better performance than the blocked condition with more dissimilar stimuli.",>Paulo Carvalho>Robert Goldstone,">Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University>Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0679/index.html
2011,Its around here: Residential history and the meaning of Midwest,"Even speakers of American English who think they grew up in the Midwest do not agree on its boundaries. So what determines the meaning of 'Midwest' to a given speaker? We argue that the meaning of a geographical term like Midwest is based in part on one's experience with locations that one knows to be part of the region. This exemplar-based knowledge causes the perceived location of the Midwest to shift depending on where in the Midwest a respondent has lived and to remain fixed in space over time despite changes in features of exemplar locations. Nonetheless, regression analyses suggest that exemplar knowledge, when available, coexists with more abstract definitional knowledge. We believe that empirical studies of meanings of geographical terms can shed light on the nature of human semantic categories and the role of specific exemplars in semantic representation.",>Vsevolod Kapatsinski>Richard Janda,>University of Oregon>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0680/index.html
2011,The Influence of Co-Occurrence and Inheritance Information on Children's Inductive Generalization,"Prior research suggests young children understand that labels serve as category markers and they can utilize this information to perform category-based induction with both identical and semantically-similar labels (Gelman & Markman, 1986). Recent research suggests that childrens ability to perform category-based induction is limited to a small subset of semantically-similar labels which co-occur in child-directed speech (Fisher, 2010; Fisher, Matlen, & Godwin, in press). However, most of the co-occurring labels used in prior research are not only semantically-similar but they also refer to baby-parent relationships (e.g., puppy-dog). Thus, children may be able to perform induction with these particular label-pairs, because they contain kinship information rather than because they co-occur. The present study aims to disentangle whether young childrens induction performance is driven by kinship information or co-occurrence probability. Results indicate that 4-year-olds induction performance was influenced by co-occurrence probability; kinship information was found to be insufficient to promote induction performance.",>Karrie Godwin>Anna Fisher>Bryan Matlen,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0681/index.html

We hypothesize this spatial registry is made possible by recruiting visuospatial resources. This spatial registry facilitates selective processing of memory items determined by the algorithmic features of the mental task. We assume that retrieving working memory items from spatial registry locations is subject to errors which are determined by biological characteristics of a population encoding of spatial registry locations. In this model, spatial-temporal factors of the population encoding of space, captures the nature of visuospatial short-term memory. Our simulation results match both the positional and the displacement error distributions for forward and reverse recall tasks in addition to fill-in errors in forward recall.",>Nader Noori>Laurent Itti,>USC>USC,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0683/index.html

2011,Bilingualism influences perceptual inhibition more than stimulus-response inhibition,"Bilinguals outperform monolinguals at suppressing task-irrelevant information, with advantages likely deriving from cognitive mechanisms employed during bilingual processing. In this study, monolinguals' and bilinguals' inhibition performance was compared on two nonlinguistic inhibition tasks: a Stroop-like task (with perceptual conflict among stimulus features) and a Simon-like task (with stimulus-response conflict, given an arbitrary response rule). Bilinguals in their early twenties had an accuracy advantage over monolinguals on the Stroop task but not the Simon task. Bilinguals showed smaller Stroop than Simon effects in their performance accuracy, while monolinguals performed similarly on the two tasks. Findings suggest that bilingual experience may target Stroop-type inhibition more than Simon-type inhibition, likely due to the perceptual conflict component of Stroop tasks that is also present in bilingual processing. Findings have implications for identifying loci of influence of bilingual experience on the cognitive system, and suggest that Stroop-type cognitive mechanisms may be especially sensitive to bilingualism.",>Henrike K.

2011,Space and time in the childs mind: Further evidence for a cross-dimensional asymmetry,"Space and time appear to be related asymmetrically in the childs mind: temporal representations depend on spatial representations more than vice versa, as predicted by space-time metaphors in language. In a study supporting this conclusion, spatial information interfered with childrens temporal judgments more than vice versa (Casasanto, Fotakopoulou, & Boroditsky, 2010, Cognitive Science). In this earlier study, however, spatial information was available to participants for more time than temporal information was (as is often the case when people observe natural events), suggesting a skeptical explanation for the observed effect. Here we conducted a stronger test of the hypothesized space-time asymmetry, controlling spatial and temporal aspects of the stimuli even more stringently than they are generally controlled in the natural world. Results replicated Casasanto and colleagues, validating their finding of a robust representational asymmetry between space and time, and extending it to children (4-10 y.o.) who speak Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese.",>Roberto Bottini>Daniel Casasanto,">University of Bergamo, Italy

2011,Probability-matching in 10-month-old infants,"Evidence from the probability learning literature indicates that when presented with simple situations that require making predictions, adults tend to probability match whereas children are likely to show maximization (Stevenson & Weir, 1959; Weir, 1964). The reason for this developmental difference is not fully understood, but one possibility investigated here is that children have fewer resources available to differentiate among the probabilities of the competing alternatives. To investigate this hypothesis at its origin, we used an anticipatory eye movement paradigm to gather two-alternative choice responses from 10-month-old infants. In two experiments we presented infants with either an entirely predictable (100-0%) or a probabilistic (70-30%) series of visual events. Infants showed evidence of probability matching rather than maximizing. These results are discussed in the context of alternative explanations for maximizing and the utility of eye-tracking as a window on infants probability learning.",>Sarah Davis>Elissa Newport>Richard Aslin,>University of Rochester>University of Rochester>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0688/index.html
2011,Children's Understanding of the Link Between Sensory Perception and Knowledge,"Over the preschool years, children develop an understanding of the relationship between their senses and the kinds of knowledge those senses acquire. This development may be supported by sensory experiences or may be linked to theory-of-mind development. 64 preschoolers were asked to identify which of 2 confederates knew the identity of a toy animal when each had differential perceptual access to the animal. In the seeing condition, one confederate looked at the animal and one did not, and in the hearing condition, one confederate listened to the animals sound and one did not. 4-year-olds outperformed 3-year-olds in both conditions, and all children performed equally well on both vision and hearing trials suggesting that children come to understand the seeing-knowing and hearing-knowing connections simultaneously.

Experiment 1 provides evidence that these young children will not form illusory correlations in a novel categorization task.

2011,The Development of Context Use and Three Way Bindings in Episodic Memory,"To address the mechanism underlying the development of episodic memory, the current study used a modified list learning paradigm for children (i.e. ABCD, ABAC, ABABr) and compared the performance of 4 year-olds, 7 year-olds, and adults. The results show that only the ABABr condition, which involves a 3-way binding structure, differed across age. Additionally, a proposed computational model (multinomial process tree model) decomposed the binding strengths involved in the given tasks and made it possible to compare the changes in these binding strengths. The model shows that though all groups have similar item binding strength, the overall context (list) binding and 3-way binding strengths develops throughout development. Aside to the general context binding strength, however, 7 year olds showed a lower context binding strength than 4 year olds.

It can account for delays of reaction times of the brain damaged patients. When the network suffers damages, the iteration numbers between the output and the cleanup layers would increase. In addition, it can also account for performances of the categorization tasks of category specific disorders, and for reading performances of dyslectic patients. We applied the attractor network to the data of Tyler et.al.(2000) for categorization task, and the data of Plaut & Schallice(1993) for word reading. In spite of variety of data, the attractor network showed good performances. When the network was damaged partially, the increases of the iteration numbers could be interpreted as the delays of reaction times.

Consequently, computational models and theoretical accounts of visual search processing have evolved from traditional parallel or serial descriptions to a continuum from efficient to inefficient. In our first experiment, we demonstrate with various control conditions that search efficiency does not increase with simultaneous delivery of target features in a conjunction search task. In the second experiment, we explore effects of incremental non-linguistic information delivery and discover improvement of search efficiency. We find a facilitatory effect when visual non-linguistic delivery of target features is concurrent with the visual display onset, but not when the target features are delivered prior to display onset. The results support an interactive account of visual perception that explains linguistic and non-linguistic mediation of visual search as chiefly due to the incrementality of target feature delivery once search has begun.",>Eric Chiu>Michael Spivey,">University of California, Merced>University of California, Merced",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0695/index.html

We refer to these behaviors as redundant actions. Despite the apparently superfluous nature of redundant actions, they are frequently produced in certain situations and have the potential to provide insight into the embodied nature of intentions. One clear example of this behavior comes from video game playing whereby individuals have a tendency to lean in the direction they wish an object or character they are in control of to go. By having participants play a racing video game, we were able to create a controlled environment to observe these behaviors. By manipulating aspects of player immersion, control input, and temporal demand, we investigate what factors lead individuals to express intentions via redundant actions.",>Joseph Chisholm>Evan Risko>Alan Kingstone,>University of British Columbia>Arizona State University>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0698/index.html
2011,The algorithmization of counterfactuals,"One of the most striking phenomenon in the study of conditionals is the ease and uniformity with which people generate, evaluate and interpret counterfactual utterance. To witness, the majority of people would accept the statement: ``If Oswald didn't kill Kennedy, someone else did,'' but few, if any, would accept its subjunctive version: ``If Oswald hadn't killed Kennedy, someone else would have.'' I will present a computational model that explains how humans reach such consensus or, more concretely, what mental representation permits such consensus to emerge from the little knowledge we have about Oswald, Kennedy and 1960's Texas, and what algorithms would need to be postulated to account for the swiftness, comfort and confidence with which such judgments are issued. The model presented is compatible with the ""possible world"" account of Lewis (1973), yet it enjoys the advantages of representational economy, algorithmic simplicity and conceptual clarity. Armed with these advantages, I will then present a panoramic view of several applications where counterfactual reasoning has benefited problem areas in the empirical sciences, including policy evaluation, causal-pathways mapping, credit and blame analysis, and personal decision making.",>Judea Pearl,">Computer Science Department

The present study examines an alternative explanation that the positive dependency in the hot hand belief may be due to peoples effort to reduce uncertainty by estimating the unknown probability (common probability estimation), a result known as the Laplaces rule of succession.

An autonomous learning system is presented that examines processes involved in the formation of context between multiple co-occurring objects, under the task of identifying abstract objects in a scene. Learning is performed using a form of Learning Classifier System, that builds representations of features autonomously under reinforcement. The feature identification system is used in combination with an associative network, used for finding co-occurrence relationships for establishing context. Experiments show the influence of the associative network to resolve ambiguous observations through the use of context. This approach involves the interaction of a reinforcement system, analogous to dopaminergic processes, with an associative system, based on associative Hebbian learning processes, and demonstrates the ability of a recurrent associative network for establishing context relationships.",>Anthony Knittel,>University of New South Wales,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0702/index.html
2011,Phonological Encoding of Sentence Production,"Previous tests of the phonological competition model (Dell, 1986) have mostly investigated the effects of phonological overlap (e.g. pick-pin) in isolated word production (e.g. primed picture naming). This is problematic since recent findings suggest that the effect of phonological overlap depends on the syntactic category of the phonologically related words, and few previous studies investigate phonological planning in the context of grammatical strings. We introduce a novel paradigm to examine two predictions of the so called parallel-then-sequential competition model (O‟Seaghdha and Marin, 2000) against data from the distribution of disfluencies in sentence production. We also extend previous work by comparing different forms of phonological overlap (identity vs. similarity) in both word onsets and rhymes.",>Caitlin Hilliard>Katrina Furth>T.

2011,To Go or to Stay: Age Differences in Cognitive Foraging,"Cognitive foraging used the metaphor of animal foraging over patches of food to study how people allocate time to multiple resources for obtaining information. We used the word search puzzle paradigm to examine age differences in cognitive foraging behavior, especially when younger and older adults switch between patches (i.e., word puzzles). Results showed that older adults were able to adjust their departure time and switch frequencies depending on patch densities and switch time costs, and found as many words as younger adults in the puzzles despite their age-related change in processing capacities. Although older adults needed more time to find a new word in the puzzle, they adaptively persisted longer and switched fewer times between puzzles than younger adults to improve their performance. The connections between age differences in information uptake rates and the time to switch to different patches were also discussed.",>Jessie Chin>Wai-Tat Fu>Elizabeth Stine-Morrow,>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign>University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0704/index.html
2011,Using a Model-Based fMRI Analysis Method to Locate the Neural Correlates of a Multitasking Bottleneck,"It has been shown that people can only maintain one problem state (a temporary mental representation, comparable to the focus of attention in working memory), at a time. When more than one problem state is required, for example in multitasking, performance decreases considerably. To locate the neural correlates of this problem state bottleneck we applied a model-based fMRI analysis method. First, a computational cognitive model was fit to the behavioral data. We then regressed the activity of the model's cognitive resources against the fMRI data to identify regions that match the model's activity. The brain region responsible for the temporary representation of problem states, the inferior parietal lobule, and the brain region responsible for long-term storage of problem states, the inferior frontal gyrus were thus identified. We show that the model-based analysis method outperforms the classical cognitive subtraction method.",>Jelmer Borst>Niels Taatgen>Hedderik Van Rijn,>University of Groningen>University of Groningen>University of Groningen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0705/index.html

The results of simulation indicated that the representational shift observed in Johansen \& Palmeri (2002) can be explained by selective attention, selective exemplar memorization, or mere random chance.

2011,Coordination of Attention to Local and Global Features: Fractal Patterns in a Speeded-Categorization Task,"How does the mind coordinate local and global features of a display to allow for adaptive functioning? To answer this question, we presented adults with a speeded categorization task in which they had to decide whether two stimuli match in a local element, in their global pattern, or in neither the local nor the global feature. The trial series of reaction times were then subjected to fractal analyses to capture the coordination that gives rise to performance. The assumption is that long-range correlations reveal themselves in pink-noise exponents, ones that are higher than white-noises exponents. To investigate the stability of fractal exponent, we manipulated both the local elements (to be either familiar or novel), and the order of trials (to be either random or blocked). Results show a significant deviation from white-noise, but only in familiar-elements condition in which trials were presented randomly.

This work presents an approach that uses an agent-based model to encompass the detailed behavior of individuals and their immediate network of relationships, as well as an influence-based system dynamics model to show how society-level influences function interactively and with respect to individual agents. The exploration of technology adoption grounds the model in a realistic environment and allows the incorporation of theoretical models from multiple relevant domains. The integrated model demonstrates how representing behavior at multiple scales is a natural approach that allows for a greater understanding of how influences across different scales interact and affect the adoption of a new technology.",>Erica Briscoe>Ethan Trewhitt>Clayton Hutto,">ATAS Laboratory

2011,Cause of the difference in the cognitive process between intervention and observation on causal induction -A study of the effect of ego-involvement-,"Pearl (2000) insisted on the importance of intervention in correlated events for causal induction. In addition, Sloman and Lagnado (2005) demonstrated that people infer differently, depending on whether they observed the events or intervened in them. I suppose that this result can be explained by the difference in the degree of ego-involvement. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of ego-involvement on causal judgment and the manner in which ego-involvement affects causal induction. In Experiment 1, the causal relationship was judged marginally more strongly when ego-involvement was present. Further, in Experiment 2, this effect was shown in a situation where causality is quite unclear or a situation where there is a fairly certain causal relationship between cause and effect. I conclude that ego-involvement affects causal induction in a situation where there is trouble because of causality.",>Yoshiko Arai,>none,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0710/index.html

Alternatively, people may represent failures as due to a hidden inhibitor that has a specific location and extent in time. We model these possibilities, and empirically test a case on which the two models make opposite predictions. We find that children as young as four years old generate responses inconsistent with proportional models, but consistent with an inhibitor-based model. Incorporating a recency component does not help proportional models fit the data.",>David Buchanan>David Sobel,>Brown University>Brown University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0711/index.html
2011,Unconscious vs. Conscious Thought in Causal Decision Making,"Recently, Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT, Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006) claimed that unconscious processing of in-formation yields better decisions. Related studies showed that deliberate reasoning resulted in worse choices than uncon-scious reasoning. Causal reasoning is often considered to be a form of deliberate, rule-based reasoning (Sloman, 1996) and causal decision making is assumed to involve inferring the potential consequences of different actions from mental causal models (Sloman & Hagmayer, 2006). Therefore, better choices would be expected after deliberation. Two experiments investigated causal decision making using the UTT paradigm. It turned out that more effective actions were chosen, when participants were asked to deliberate rather than to turn their attention to another task or to decide immediately. These results add to other findings indicating that the superiority of unconscious thought may be limited to specific decision making situations.",>Stefan Mangold>York Hagmayer,>University of Göttingen>University of Göttingen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0712/index.html
2011,Heuristics in Covariation-based Induction of Causal Models: Sufficiency and Necessity Priors,"Our main goal in the present set of studies was to re-visit the question whether people are capable of inducing causal models from covariation data alone without further cues, such as temporal order. In the literature there has been a debate between bottom-up and top-down learning theories in causal learning. Whereas top-down theorists claim that in structure induction, covariation information plays none or only a secondary role, bottom-up theories, such as causal Bayes net theory, assert that people are capable of inducing structure from conditional dependence and independence information alone. Our three experiments suggest that both positions are wrong. In simple three-variable domains people are indeed often capable of reliably picking the right model. However, this can be achieved by simple heuristics that do not require complex statistics.",>Ralf Mayrhofer>Michael Waldmann,">University of Göttingen, Germany>University of Göttingen, Germany",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0713/index.html

One crowd generated solutions based on two ideas randomly paired from previous crowds ideas. The other crowd came up with solutions based on one idea and a criticism for this idea generated by previous crowds. Whereas solutions based on two ideas were on average rated more creative than those based on an idea and criticisms, the five most creative solutions that addressed criticisms were rated significantly more creative than the five most creative ideas that combined two ideas. We conclude that a critical crowd can be useful if the goal is to collect a small number of highly creative ideas using the sequential application of crowds.",>Yuko Tanaka>Yasuaki Sakamoto>Takashi Kusumi,">Howe School of Technology Managements, Stevens Institute of Technology>Howe School of Technology Managements, Stevens Institute of Technology>Graduate School of Education, Kyoto University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0714/index.html
2011,Comics on the Brain: Structure and Meaning in Sequential Image Comprehension,"Just as syntax differentiates coherent sentences from scrambled word strings, sequential images must also use a cognitive system to distinguish coherent narratives from random strings of images. We conducted experiments analogous to two classic psycholinguistic studies to examine structure and semantics in sequential images. We compared Normal comic strips with both structure and meaning to sequences with Semantics Only, Structure Only, or randomly Scrambled panels. Experiment 1 used a target-monitoring paradigm, and found that RTs were slowest to target panels in Scrambled sequences, intermediate in Structural Only and Semantic Only sequences, and fastest in Normal sequences. Experiment 2 measured ERPs to the same strips. The largest N400 appeared in Scrambled and Structural Only sequences, intermediate in Semantic Only sequences and smallest in Normal sequences. Together, these findings suggest that sequential image comprehension is guided by an interaction between a structure and meaning, broadly analogous to syntax and semantics in language.",>Neil Cohn>Martin Paczynski>Phil Holcomb>Ray Jackendoff>Gina Kuperberg,">Tufts University>Tufts University>Tufts University>Tufts University>Tufts University

2011,How visual saliency affects referent accessibility,"As referents are more accessible in discourse, they can be referred to with more attenuated expressions, such as pronouns. Accessibility is known to be affected by the referents saliency in the linguistic context, but much less is known about the effect of saliency in the visual context. In this paper, we investigate whether a referents visual saliency affects the choice of referring expression in a discourse context. The results of a story completion experiment show that visually salient referents induce more attenuated expressions, but only when they are linguistically non-salient. Linguistically salient referents receive more reduced references when they are visually non-salient. We argue that visual saliency affects accessibility when the impact of linguistic factors is moderated. In addition, when the story does not match peoples expectations, processing difficulties might result in the use of less costly expressions.",>Jorrig Vogels>Emiel Krahmer>Alfons Maes,>Tilburg University>Tilburg University>Tilburg University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0716/index.html

In this study, we instead investigate whether people are able to use variability when making likelihood judgments: participants determined from which of two possible populations a sample was more likely to have been drawn.

It is proposed that these judgments are derived from a combination of the likelihood of every known risk factor that could affect the outcome of the uncertain event, each weighted by the chance recalling that risk. To test this proposal, an ACT-R model was developed in a study of Royal Navy officers. Each officer read six scenarios describing operational situations and assessed the likelihood of success in each situation. Then they noted all the possible risks that might affect that operation and the likelihood of these risks occurring. The model combined the likelihood of the different risks to predict the overall judgments of likelihood of success. When overconfidence was incorporated into the model, there was a good fit between the model and the experimental data, supporting this model as a possible mechanism for expert judgments.",>Adrian Banks>Stefan Gershater,>University of Surrey>Defence Maritime Logistics School,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0718/index.html

Divergent mathematical thinking is defined as creative, efficient, and accurate engagement in the cognitive processes of reasoning, problem-solving, communicating, representing, and proof. Using modified talk-aloud protocols, real-time naturalistic analysis of a group of eighth-grade students mathematical problem solving were conducted. In total, 344 video-taped episodes were analyzed from six students who completed mathcam video diaries of their problem-solving during homework completion. Results suggest that students who exhibited divergent mathematical thinking tended to engage error analysis and mathematical analogy more often than those that did not. Furthermore, those students tended to benefit from productive failure from ill-defined mathematical problems more so than students who did not exhibit divergent mathematical thinking.

2011,Introducing Chinese Characters to Beginners Through the Use of Embodied Animations,"Chinese has become one of the most popular foreign languages in K-12 classrooms and colleges in the US. However, it is considered hard-to-learn due to its difficult characters. We created the computer-based Chinese character learning (CCL) program using the embodied animations (EA), which are the animations that contain bodily movements or gestures in videos. The empirical study investigated whether EA facilitates CCL for beginning learners by comparing three learning conditions: traditional learning (TL), etymological animation learning (AL), and embodied animation learning (EAL). The study adopted an experimental between-subject design. The learning materials were 18 characters. Thirty-six adult participants who did not speak any Chinese were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The results show that the EAL group yielded better CCL outcome than the AL group, and both groups outperformed the TL group.

2011,The different effects of thinking aloud and writing on graph comprehension,"We report an experiment which seeks to determine how novice users' conceptual understanding of graphs differs depending on the nature of the interaction with them. Undergraduate psychology students interpreted three-variable ""interaction"" data in either bar or line graph form and were required to either think aloud while doing so or to produce written interpretations. Analysis of the verbal protocols and written interpretations showed that producing a written interpretation revealed significantly higher levels of comprehension than interpreting them while thinking aloud. Specifically, a significant proportion of line graph users in the verbal protocol condition was either unable to interpret the graphs, or misinterpreted information presented. The occurrence of these errors was substantially lower for the bar graph users in the verbal protocol condition. In contrast, analysis of the written condition revealed no significant difference in the level of comprehension between the two graph types. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.",>Nadia Ali>David Peebles,>University of Huddersfield>University of Huddersfield,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0721/index.html
2011,"Action, Imagery, and the N400","A framework is developed for the total response to all potentially meaningful sensory stimulation within the window of 40 to 220ms post-onset. The framework is intended explain the temporal invariance of the N400 ERP component (Kutas & Federmeier 2011) as a deadline for anticipating needed system-wide change in preparation for conscious control in action, rather than the binding of a preliminary semantic representation (Federmeier & Laszlo 2009). The pre-N400 window includes affective responses (Barrett & Bar 2009), recapitulation of sensory information, selection of LSF object and scene analogs, guidance from scripts, and 'proxy percepts'. Proxy percepts are offered as an alternative to simulation. I illustrate the framework with a moment-by-moment scenario of a whale watcher perceiving 'a blow'. I also argue that Noe's (2004) theory of virtual presence has use for proxy percepts and that proxy percepts offer an understanding of eye saccades more parsimonious than Grush's (2004) emulation account.",>Michael Metzler,>,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0722/index.html

It is unknown, however, whether these interactions are restricted to conscious perception, or extend to preconscious processing as well. Here we examine the role of emotional content on preconscious face and word processing, taking advantage of interocular suppression to render a stimulus invisible for a short duration, and using an orthogonal spatial task (location discrimination) to identify the time at which a stimulus emerges from visual suppression. Crucially, consistent patterns were observed for emotional content across modality: negative stimuli (angry faces and negative words) took longer to emerge than positively valenced stimuli (happy faces and positive words). We discuss how differences in task demands can produce apparently incompatible patterns of results, and show how these different results can be reconciled within attentional accounts of negativity bias.",>David Vinson>Andrew Anderson>William Ratoff>Bahador Bahrami>Gabriella Vigliocco,">University College London>University College London>University College London>University College London

2011,Assessing Young Children's Hierarchical Action Segmentation,"Recognizing where action units begin and end is an early-developing skill that supports inferences about goals motivating others' action. One notable feature of goal-directed action is that segments are organized hierarchically. That is, action is interpreted as structured with respect to the goals and sub-goals of an actor, which can be recognized as corresponding to coarser- and finer-grained action units respectively. We report on the success of adapting a nonverbal paradigm to index hierarchical action segmentation in a developmental population. Results indicated that 3- and 4-year-old children, similar to adults in past studies, responded to segment boundaries with surges in attention that varied according to event granularity (e.g., fine- vs. coarse-grained). This effect was seen most strongly in children displaying superior memory for the events.",>Meredith Meyer>Dare A.

An important question is how much action structure and segmentation information is available in the observed surface level motion and image changes, without any knowledge of human pose or behavior. Here we present a novel approach to jointly segmenting and recognizing videos of human action sequences, using a hierarchical topic model. Video sequences are represented as bags of video words, automatically discovered from local space-time interest points. Our model jointly infers both action identification and action segmentation.

Within each condition we distinguished paths of hurricanes using topological equivalence classes. Topology allows for differentiating ending relations that are potentially relevant for event conceptualization (Regier, 2007). Results show that motion matters. Participants constructed static icon groups more distinctly and focused more on ending relations. The presentation mode additionally influenced linguistic descriptions.

In fact, ethnocentrism is considered to be one of the simplest mechanisms for establishing cooperation in the competitive environment of natural selection. Here we study a recent agent-based model. Through our simulations and analysis, we establish that the mechanism responsible for the emergence of cooperation is children residing close to their parents. Our results suggest that group tags maintain cooperation, but do not create it. We formalize this observation as the dual direct hypothesis: ethnocentric agents dominate humanitarian agents by exploiting the unconditional cooperation of humanitarians of di erent tags to maintain the number of ethnocentric agents after world saturation. We affirm previous observations on the importance of world saturation, finding its drastic effect on dynamics in both spatial tag-based and tag-less models",>Artem Kaznatcheev>Thomas R.

The current experiment investigated the influence of spatial and perceptual features on landmark selection. Subjects watched a movie of a simulated path through a virtual environment. Four landmarks were located at the corners of each intersection, with one of the landmarks uniquely colored. After viewing the video, subjects provided both written descriptions and maps of the path. Landmarks included in these descriptions were coded for both location and perceptual salience. Participants included more landmarks located at far corners of an intersection and at intersections with a turn. Uniquely colored landmarks were not included more often than chance.

We propose that amount of activation depends on encoding transparency, a plausible theoretical statement which has received mixed support using standard priming tasks. The repetition blindness (RB) paradigm was employed to infer activation during reading of Chinese vs. English by native speakers. RB is the failure of conscious perception for repeated or similar items. Chinese and English stimuli were matched for frequency and target words' similarity. Sequences such as played moon braid team were rapidly displayed at 115 ms per word. For English readers, phonological RB was robust, but semantic RB was absent. For Chinese readers, semantic RB was reliable, but phonological RB was weak. Amount of phonological RB increased in Chinese (but not English) for naming stimuli (compared to handwriting), indicating that phonological RB increases when readers need to activate phonology.",>Catherine Caldwell-Harris>Hui-wen Cheng>Tingyan Li>Alison Morris,>Boston University>Boston University>Boston University>Iowa State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0730/index.html

Discrete theories posit that only the selected item sends activation to the next level while cascading theories posit that activation may spread from all activated (even unselected) items. This study investigated whether information may cascade from phoneme to articulatory levels using the picture-word interference task. Subjects were presented with target and distractor words with vowels differing in either height, backness or both. Phonetic analyses indicate that target vowels were pulled toward the distractor vowel, but only along the front-back dimension. For example, back vowels are articulated farther forward in the mouth in the context of a front distractor than when presented in isolation. This provides support for cascading theories and provides evidence that articulations may consist of blends of multiple phonemes.",>Ariel Goldberg,>Tufts University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0731/index.html

For example, we tend to mark large objects with back vowels, e.g., /u/ in ""huge,"" and small objects with front vowels, e.g., /i/ in ""tiny."" Previous research into sound symbolic naming has suggested that an objects motion is considered when naming the object. We report results from two experiments in which participants are asked to name objects moving in various speeds and patterns and one experiment in which participants are asked to name the motions themselves. Sound symbolic naming for motion was only found when naming movements, and not in the naming of the object in motion. This suggests that although an object in motion and the motion itself are highly related concepts, sound symbolic naming tends to be based on stable properties, e.g., size and shape when naming objects and speed and fluidity when naming motions.",>Patrick D.

However, recognizing common causal systems across domains is challenging. Prior research suggests these categories are not obvious to novices; when participants sorted descriptions of natural phenomena that varied in causal system and content domain, science experts sorted via causal system, while novices primarily sorted by domain (Rottman, Gentner, & Goldwater in prep). In the current study, novices received training with a small set of real-world phenomena before carrying out the sorting task. We varied whether they read full causal explanations of the phenomena and whether they analogically compared pairs of descriptions from the same causal system. Either reading full explanations or analogically comparing descriptions alone helped little.

Generally, it is assumed that simplicity can be described by counting the number of elements in an explanation, e.g. the number of causes, and this approach has been taken by fields as diverse as philosophy, psychology, and statistics. One alternative is that in the case of causal reasoning, one might consider the simpler explanation to be the one that includes the fewest unexplained causes, i.e. the fewest root nodes in the language of Bayesian causal-nets. We present two experiments supporting the hypothesis that this metric for simplicity is sometimes used in choosing between explanations, and can outweigh the total number of causes invoked in an explanation.",>Michael Pacer>Tania Lombrozo,">University of California, Berkeley>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0734/index.html

Here we propose a hypothesis for manipulation of items in working memory, which relies on registering items in a spatially-organized short-term memory store. Switching executive attention to items that need processing may then be embodied through shifting spatial attention towards those registry locations. We studied gaze shifts of human subjects during memory tasks as a proxy for shifts in spatial attention. Analysis of gaze shifts during sorting random sequences of five decimal digits indicates that sorting in memory elicits gaze shifts that correlate with sorting procedure. Our proposal establishes a functional relationship between general-purpose production mechanisms that support algorithmic memory tasks with amodal items, and modal systems for perception and action.",>Nader Noori>Laurent Itti,">University of Southern California, Computer Science Department>University of Southern California, Computer Science Department, Psychology Department",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0735/index.html
2011,"Individual differences in anchoring: numerical ability, education and experience","Anchoring is a well-known effect leading to bias in estimation in various decision-making contexts. A question, however, is whether individuals with greater numerical and academic ability would be less prone to this effect than others because of greater ability to discern the value being estimated. In light of growing interest in the role of individual differences in bias susceptibility, anchoring was examined in a simulated poker-like card game, using people with varying levels of academic achievement and psychometric reasoning scores. The results showed that anchoring susceptibility was unrelated to education levels, but negatively associated with numerical reasoning and cognitive reflection scores. This result, however, was mediated by task expertise because participants with higher cognitive abilities were those more likely to display improvements in anchoring performance over the course of the experiment.",>Matthew Welsh>Paul Delfabbro>Nicholas Burns>Steve Begg,>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0736/index.html
2011,The Effects of Numeral Classifiers and Taxonomic Categories in Chinese SpeakersRecall of Nouns,"It has been suggested that classifiers in Mandarin Chinese serve a semantic function of categorizing the nouns in terms of their perceptual and functional features. We investigated the classifiers organizational utility in a recall task by contrasting it with that of taxonomic categories. Mandarin participants studied and recalled immediately two lists of nouns, one associated with four taxonomic categories and the other with four classifiers. The nouns were presented randomly in bare forms or in four columns headed by category names or classifiers. Comparable subjective clustering effects were found in the recall of taxonomically categorized nouns whether they were presented randomly or in columns. The recall of classifier categorized nouns showed no clustering when presented randomly, but some (though smaller) clustering when presented in columns. The findings suggest that classifiers do not serve the same function as taxonomic categories and that their semantic function may be limited.",>Shuping Huang>Jenn-Yeu Chen,">Department of Foreign Languages and Literature, National Sun Yat-Sen University>Department of Psychology, National Cheng Kung University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0737/index.html
2011,Working Memory Capacity and Generalization in Predictive Learning,"The relationship between working memory and deliberative processing was examined in a human contingency learning experiment that employed the combined positive and negative patterning procedure of Shanks and Darby (1998). Participants with a large working memory capacity showed generalization consistent with the application of an opposites rule (i.e., a compound and its elements signal opposite outcomes), whilst individuals with a small working memory capacity showed generalization consistent with surface similarity. Working memory capacity was assessed via the Operation Span task (Turner & Engle, 1989).

2011,Interaction of goal-directed and Pavlovian systems in aversive domains,"Recent neuroscientific models of human behavior distinguish between different cognitive controllers: two instrumental systems (goal-directed and habitual) that maximize utility through learned actions, and the Pavlovian system, which implements innate reactive responses. Although the interaction between instrumental and Pavlovian controllers has been suggested as a key process underlying emotional phenomena and surprising forms of misbehavior, few is known about it, especially in the sensorimotor aversive domain. With a combined experimental and computational approach, we study the interactions between goal-directed and Pavlovian processes in the aversive domain. First, we present a human experiment in which goal-directed and Pavlovian systems compete in order to control responses. The results indicate that Pavlovian processes can significantly interfere with goal-directed behavior. Second, we compare four alternative Bayesian models for their accuracy in modeling human performance. The results indicate a better fit for an architecture in which Pavlovian controller can use both model-based and model-free features.",>Francesco Rigoli>Enea Francesco Pavone>Giovanni Pezzulo,">ISTC-CNR, via san martino della battaglia, 00185, Roma (Italy)>Universita' di Roma ""la Sapienza"",Roma, Italy>ISTC-CNR, via san martino della battaglia, 00185, Roma (Italy)",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0739/index.html

One explanation for these findings is the limited information processing capacity of working memory. The current study further investigates this topic by using more complex tasks as many errors in Dynamic Decision-Making (DDM) are thought to be related to limited processing. Our results indicate that metacognitive prompting results in better performance in DDM over incubation via a better strategy selection. Results are explained referring to methodological reasons and to literature on metacognition. In addition to the theoretical relevance, findings may be relevant for training programs using DDM simulations.",>Jarrett Evans>Dominik Güss>Walter Boot,>Florida State University>University of North Florida>Florida State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0740/index.html
2011,Grammatical aspect in language production: Using gesture to reveal event representations,"Grammatical aspect is a pervasive linguistic device that, according to linguistic analyses, allows speakers to encode different ways of construing events. For instance, the progressive (I am writing a book) is thought to reflect increased focus on the internal details of an event, as contrasted with the perfect (I have written a book). However, there is to date no experimental evidence that speakers in fact think about the same events differently when they describe them using progressive versus perfect aspect. We used co-speech gesture as a means to investigate what speakers' event representations are like when they produce perfect versus progressive utterances. We found that progressive event descriptions were accompanied by longer-lasting and more complex gestures than perfect event descriptions, but only when participants described events originally presented in the progressive. This evidence suggests that people are actually construing events differently when they use different grammatical aspects.",>Fey Parrill>Benjamin Bergen>Patricia Lichtenstein,">Case Western Reserve University, Department of Cognitive Science>University of California, San Diego, Department of Cognitive Science>University of California, Merced, Department of Cognitive and Information Science",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0741/index.html

One such procedure is the Divide and Choose. Recently, the mathematical theory of fair-division extended this idea by developing procedures that offer fairer outcomes and a better guarantee of justice. Here, we tested the extent to which the distributive and procedural properties of these perfect and improved division procedures were perceived as more satisfactory and fairer than imperfect division procedures. Thirty-nine pairs of participants divided six $10 gift certificates between them using seven division procedures. They rated their satisfaction and their perceived fairness before and after they executed each division procedure. Contrarily to our hypothesis, the results show that perfect procedural justice does not really translate into the perception of a fairer and more satisfactory outcome and process.

2011,Determining the Representation of Sentences in Memory,"The present research explores the possibility of several types of memory representations for sentences. A recognition experiment was performed to test participants memory for different types of sentences. Two groups of study sentences were constructed. One group was based around associating pairs of words together in the study sentences that would also appear together in distractor test sentences. The other groups study sentences maintained the same number of words in common with the distractor test sentences, but with fewer associations between them. It was found that participants were significantly more likely to false alarm to distractor test sentences when they read sentences containing multiple inter-word associations than when they read sentences containing fewer of those associations. A second recognition experiment was performed to further manipulate the ratio of associations in the study sentences and to get a baseline measure of false alarm rates for sentences containing no associations.",>Stephen Smith>Simon Dennis,>The Ohio State University>The Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0743/index.html

In this series of studies, we consider how the same 2 X 2 covariation pattern is interpreted by 4 and 6 year old children to explain a cause. In the first study, two dolls played on two activities where their behavior covaried by doll or activity. Children were asked to explain the cause of the dolls' behavior and predict future behavior. In the second study, we presented the same covariation data but instead framed it in terms of physical causality, i.e., the dolls were treated as physical objects that either stuck or did not stick to the activities. Preliminary results reveal that children think differently about physical and psychological causes, even with the same covariation pattern. Additionally, they appear to reason about probabilistic data much more naturally in the psychological than the physical domain.",>Elizabeth Seiver>Alison Gopnik,>UC Berkeley>UC Berkeley,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0744/index.html

These children are likely to benefit from instruction in the task. Here we investigate the possibility that different types of gesture-speech relationships might index readiness to learn for adult novice learners. Adults, naïve to organic chemistry, were asked to create stereoisomers of molecules, a task that requires mentally transforming and drawing an alternative spatial arrangement of parts of the molecule. Adults whose gestures added correct information to the information conveyed in speech at pretest were more likely to learn on the task than adults whose gestures did not add information or added incorrect information. These findings suggest that, even for adult learners and complex tasks, gesture reveals implicit knowledge about the task at hand and can be used to identify who is ready to learn.",>Raedy Ping>Elena Zinchenko>Samuel Larson>Mary-Anne Decatur>Susan Goldin-Meadow,>University of Chicago>University of Chicago>University of Chicago>University of Chicago>University of Chicago,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0746/index.html

Using a method we call Pair Analytics, we have extended the application of JAT to the study of analytical reasoning in computer-mediated, human-to-human interactions. Pair analytics (PA) sets a naturalistic scenario in which the social and cognitive role of human-human and human-computer interactions can be studied. In this paper, we support the claim that coupling JAT and PA is an effective research strategy to capture and study three socio-cognitive phenomena in collaborative visual analytics: (1) structuring and navigation of joint analysis; (2) management of joint attention; (3) and signaling of cognitively demanding tasks.",>Arias-Hernandez Richard>Kaastra Linda T.>Fisher Brian,>Simon Fraser University>University of British Columbia>Simon Fraser University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0747/index.html

Cognitive science research has demonstrated that a well-organized, conceptual knowledge organization is a key difference between experts and novices. One method to help novices move toward more expert-like performance may be to provide them with visual materials that support the development of an organized representation of domain ideas. In this research, participants used graphical versus keyword interfaces to complete searches for online educational materials; usability software was used to record participants on-screen interactions and think-aloud protocols. Results demonstrated that the graphical interface changed overall patterns of search behaviors and promoted deeper, domain-related processing during search and evaluation. These findings demonstrate that graphical displays can impact online, self-regulated learning, likely by providing a well-organized structure of domain concepts that facilitates meaningful evaluation and more effective planning during online information seeking.",>Kirsten Butcher>Sarah Davies>Ashley Crockett>Robert Zheng>Aaron Dewald>Anne Cook,>University of Utah>University of Utah>University of Utah>University of Utah>University of Utah>University of Utah,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0749/index.html

Following the hypothesis that coordination phenomena are related to empathy (Gallese, 2001; Lipps, 1900), we used a motion capture system to follow head movements of 28 pairs of subjects during conversations. Half the dyads were instructed to know each other (empathic condition). Subjects in the remaining dyads expected the other to lie (non-empathic condition). Positions were cross-correlated in time for each dyad. A mirroring-coordination analysis (one moving left equivalent to another moving right) showed that subjects in both conditions tend to mirror each other within the range of one second. A corresponding-coordination analysis (one moving left equivalent to the other moving left) yielded a statistically significant difference between conditions: coordination still appeared in the empathic condition, but disappeared in the non-empathic condition.

Seventy-five second through fourth grade students received an instructional intervention on solving mathematical equivalence problems (i.e. 2 + 4 + 5 = __ + 5), while being asked to self-explain six items, complete twelve items, or only complete six items. Both self-explanation and additional practice increased procedural learning, but self-explanation resulted in increased procedural transfer at post and retention test. Self-explain students adapted the most flexible strategy sooner than the non-explain groups. High quality explanations were correlated with conceptual knowledge at retention test.

In this paper, we explore whether and to what degree the processing of visual and spatial information interferes with the task of translation from natural language into logic, a skill that students often find difficult to master.

2011,Holographic Reduced Representations and Vector Symbolic Architectures as Tools for Cognitive Modelling,"Vector symbolic architectures (VSAs), such as holographic reduced representations (HRRs), can be understood as schemes for representing knowledge and implementing symbol manipulation in connectionist architectures. We characterize VSAs in terms of five basic operators: similarity, superposition, binding, unbinding, and permutation. We compare the different VSAs in the literature on space and time complexity and unbinding accuracy, and on qualitative differences in how their operators function. We find that binary spatter codes, and real-valued and frequency-domain HRRs compare favourably to other types of VSA. We discuss the advantages of VSAs over traditional connectionist and symbolic approaches. VSAs retain the expressive power of symbolic approaches with the added benefit of being lossy representations. The lossy nature of VSAs makes them easily scalable to large problems and suited to modelling biological memory. Whether VSAs can be applied to problem domains that cannot be trivially discretized into symbols remains an open question.",>Matthew A. Kelly>Robert L.

2011,Cross-modal effects in statistical learning: Evidence from the McGurk illusion,"Statistical learning is assumed to play a vital role in language acquisition, yet it is unknown whether it is guided by a unitary, modality-general mechanism, or by several sensory-specific mechanisms. Consistent with the latter view, Seitz et al (2007) tested learners with multimodal input and found that statistical learning in one modality is independent of input to other modalities. We tested this assertion of independence by presenting learners with speech streams synchronized with a video of a speakers face. We used the McGurk illusion to manipulate the underlying statistical structure of the speech streams. Contrasting the independence hypothesis, our results suggest that participants can integrate audio and visual input to perceive the McGurk illusion during statistical learning, thereby altering the pattern of segmentation. Our results suggest that auditory and visual inputs are not processed independently, but leave unresolved whether the resulting representations are integrated across modalities or not.",>Aaron Mitchel>Morten Christiansen>Daniel Weiss,>The Pennsylvania State University>Cornell University>The Pennsylvania State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0754/index.html
2011,Productivity and Reuse in Language: a Developmental Study,"Fragment Grammars (FG) are a computational framework for studying the related problems of linguistic productivity and reuse (ODonnell, 2011; ODonnell et al., 2009). They treat determining which structures should be computed on the fly and which should be retrieved from memory as an optimal Bayesian inference. Elsewhere, we show how the model correctly captures the adult patterns of productivity and reuse in English derivational morphology and verbal inflection (ODonnell, 2011; ODonnell et al., 2009). Here we evaluate the models ability to capture U-shaped development for the English past tense. We compare performance to several competing computational models and show that only FG is able to accurately capture key aspects of the empirical data, including low, but substantial rates of overregularization and gradual improvement in the use of the regular rule (Hoeffner, 1996; Marcus et al., 1992).

2011,Generalization to Novel Consonants in Artificial Grammar Learning,"While theoretical phonologists rely on abstract phonetic features to account for the variety of phonological patterns that exist in the worlds languages, it is unclear whether such abstract representations bear psychological reality. Previous research has shown that learners in artificial grammar learning experiments are able to generalize a newly learned phonological pattern to novel segments, suggesting that learners are able to form abstract, feature-based representations. However, conflicting results suggest that this level of abstraction may be restricted to vowels, rather than consonants. The present experiment extends previous findings on generalization to novel segments in vowel harmony to an analogous pattern, consonant harmony. We show that learners fail to generalize to novel consonants in consonant harmony, but succeed at generalization to novel consonants in a general, consonant deletion pattern. Implications for the role of distinctive phonetic features in phonological learning are discussed.",>Sara Finley,>University of Rochester,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0756/index.html
2011,Memory limitations alone do not lead to over-regularization: An experimental and computational investigation,"The ``less is more'' hypothesis suggests that one reason adults and children differ in their language acquisition abilities is that they also differ in other cognitive capacities. According to one version, children's relatively poor memory may make them more likely to over-regularize inconsistent input (Hudson Kam & Newport 2005, 2009). This paper investigates this hypothesis experimentally and computationally. Experiments in which adults were placed under a high cognitive load during a language-learning task reveal that in adults, increased load does not result in increased over-regularization. A computational model offers a possible explanation for these results, demonstrating that over-regularization should occur only in the presence of memory limitations as well as a strong prior bias for over-regularization. Taken together, these findings suggest that the difference in over-regularization between adults and children may not be attributable solely to differences in memory capacity between the two groups.",>Amy Perfors,>University of Adelaide,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0757/index.html
2011,Learning individual words and learning about words simultaneously,"Children are guided by constraints and biases in word learning. In the case of the shape biasthe tendency to extend count nouns by similarity in shapeprevious findings have revealed that learning plays an important role in its development (e.g., Smith et al., 2002). Some have proposed that children acquire inductive constraints like the shape bias by making inferences about observed data on multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., Smith et al. 2002; Kemp et al., 2007). The current study provides support for this hypothesis by demonstrating that preschoolers can rapidly and flexibly form overhypotheses about the role of arbitrary features, not just shape, in determining how words refer to object categories. This work suggests that when learning individual words, children are also learning about words simultaneously. Childrens ability to learn to learn may have implications for the origins of learning biases in many different cognitive domains, not just in language learning.",>Sylvia Yuan>Amy Perfors>Josh Tenenbaum>Fei Xu,">University of California, Berkeley>The University of Adelaide>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>University of California, Berkeley",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0758/index.html

Additionally, it is unclear whether underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms in metaphor and literal sentence processing are distinct, a confusion due to a lack of control over numerous confounding factors in previous research (Schmidt et al., 2010). We presented a highly controlled set of literal and metaphorical sentences ending in words from two modalities, auditory (shriek) and motion (crawl) (Cardillo et al., 2010) to 16 participants. The N400 (a gauge of semantic processing) was calculated based on electroencephalographic recordings at 64 scalp sites. We found an interaction between quadrant of electrode and modality, supporting modulation of neural semantic mechanisms by modality.

It was hypothesized that experience in language brokering leads to a greater sensitivity to non-literal meanings of expressions and a more analytic orientation to speech sounds in each language. The results supported these hypotheses. Experiment 1 showed that in making plausibility judgments for phrases that had a literal meaning, a non-literal meaning, or an absurd meaning, bilinguals with brokering experience performed significantly faster than non-brokers in accessing non-literal meanings. Experiment 2 showed that on a task requiring participants to delete the first sound of cross-language homophones, brokers performance was sensitive to differences in properties of the sounds in each language, whereas non-brokers performance did not differ across languages.",>Kelly Milliken>Belem Lopez>Jyotsna Vaid>Chaitra Rao,">Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University>National Brain Research Center,India",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0760/index.html

In Study 1 participants identified antonyms of these verbs in a free-response task and a matching task from which the most commonly identified antonyms were compiled. In Study 2, we determined whether the argument-distributions for the verbs in these antonym-pairs were sufficiently similar to predict the most frequently-identified antonym. Cosine similarity correlates moderately with the proportions of antonym-pairs identified by people (r = 0.31). More impressively, 87% of the time the most frequently-identified antonym is either the first- or second-most similar pair in the set of alternatives.

We argue that the question of default is overly simplistic and propose instead to think of scalar implicature computation as a problem of optimal cue combination within a constraint-based framework.

In contrast, recent psycholinguistic models have suggested that metaphors and similes may promote different comprehension processes. In this study, we investigated the neural substrates involved in the comprehension of metaphor and simile using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate whether simile comprehension differs from metaphor comprehension or not. In the metaphor and simile sentence conditions, higher activation was seen in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45/47) and temporal regions. This result suggests that the activation in both metaphor and simile conditions show similar patterns. The result also suggests that the activation patterns are affected by the properties of words (degree of the comprehensibility or similarity between a topic and a vehicle) rather than by the different sentence pattern.",>Midori Shibata>Akira Toyomura>Jun-ichi Abe,>Hokkaido University>Tokyo Denki University>Hokkaido University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0764/index.html

Participants were also given a language-background questionnaire (LEAP-Q) to assess their English proficiency. An analysis using mixed-effects modeling showed that acceptance of anglicized ungrammatical Chinese sentences was correlated with age of acquisition, L2 cultural identification, and L2 reading skill and exposure.

In our first experiment, we applied an acceptability task after speeded auditory presentation of French versions of sentences with and without repairs like I will go to (the butcher, uh no,) the baker. I need some bread/meat. While repairs led to reduced acceptability for consistent continuations, the inconsistent continuation was more acceptable when a compatible but repaired constituent had been mentioned before, suggesting that the to-be-repaired constituent was not fully overwritten by the correction. In our second experiment, we auditorily presented participants with the stimuli compiled for Experiment 1, while they looked at corresponding visual stimuli. Evidence from eye fixation patterns suggests that the to-be-repaired constituent was actually suppressed online during sentence processing.

2011,Topic Shift in Efficient Discourse Production,"Speakers have been hypothesized to organize discourse content so as to achieve communicative efficiency. Previous work has focused on indirect tests of the hypothesis that speakers aim to keep per-word entropy constant across discourses to achieve communicative efficiency. We present novel and more direct evidence by examining the role of topic shift in discourse planning. If speakers aim for constant per-word entropy, they should encode less unconditional per-word entropy (as estimated based on only sentence-internal cues) following topic shifts, as there is less relevant context to condition on. Applying latent topic modeling to a large set of English texts, we find that speakers are indeed sensitive to the recent topic structure in the predicted way.",>Ting Qian>T.

2011,Determinants of learning difficulty and boundary uncertainty in unidimensional category learning,"Many real-world learning and classification problems involve mastering subtle and noisy distinctions. For example, predicting the winner of a baseball game is challenging due to numerous interactions and inherent noise in outcomes. One common approach in machine learning to reduce overfitting and boost performance (i.e., generalization) on novel test items is to use regularization methods that effectively smooth the training data. One research question is whether human performance can be boosted by effectively regularizing (i.e., idealizing) the training set. In the first two studies, participants learned and were tested on perceptual categories. Idealization was manipulated across conditions in terms of distribution variance and feedback type. In the third study, participants predicted the outcome of actual baseball games after training on either actual or idealized game results. In all three studies, participants performed better on generalization tests (involving actual items) when trained on idealized items than on actual items.",>Gyslain Giguère>Bradley C.

2011,Perceptual learning for a familiar category under inversion: An analogue of face inversion?,"This study investigated the link between expertise for a prototype-defined category and the face inversion effect. Participants in this study were first presented with a categorisation task in which they were asked to sort a number of chequerboards (in an upright orientation) into two categories. Then, in the next (study) phase, participants were presented with a set of chequerboards which included exemplars (some upright, some inverted) from one of the two categories that participants were familiar with, plus exemplars (also upright or inverted) from a novel category. Following this, participants were tested for old/new recognition for these exemplars We succeeded in obtaining the same pattern of effects reported in McLaren (1997), i.e. a significant inversion effect for stimuli drawn from the familiar category, but with standard recognition procedures. We interpret the results in terms of McLaren and Mackintosh's (2000) theory of representation development.",>IPL McLaren>Ciro Civile,>University of Exeter>University of Exeter,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0769/index.html
2011,Informativity versus logic: Children and adults take different approaches to word learning,"The question of how children learn what words mean is one that has long perplexed philosophers and psychologists. As Quine famously pointed out, the problem of accounting for word learning is a deep one: simply hearing a word uttered in the presence of an object tells a learner next to nothing about its meaning. Yet somehow, children learn to understand and use words correctly. How? Here, we find that learning theory offers an elegant solution to this seemingly intractable puzzle in language acquisition. To test its predictions, we administered an ambiguous word-learning task to toddlers, undergraduates and developmental psychologists. Intriguingly, while the toddlers performance was consistent with our hypothesis  and with the workings of general learning mechanisms that would facilitate verbal acquisition  adult performance differed markedly. These results have implications both for how adult intutions inform the study of early language learning and for problems in second-language acquisition.",>Michael Ramscar>Melody Dye>Joseph Klein>Linda Diana Ruiz>Nicole Aguirre>Lily Sadaat,>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0770/index.html
2011,The Effect of Labels on Children's Category Learning,"The effect of language on perception of the visual world is an ongoing debate among researchers. According to one account, labels facilitate categorization by highlighting commonalities among labeled objects. Yet according to another account, early in development labels attenuate categorization by interfering with visual processing. In the current study, 4-year-old children were trained on two contrasting categories that were either labeled or presented in silence. Children were trained to discriminate the categories by associating them with a target object (Experiment 1) or with a target label (Experiment 2). Results demonstrated that children were more likely to learn the visual categories when images were presented in silence than when labeled. Furthermore, there was no evidence that children in the label condition reliably learned the categories, casting doubt on the idea that labels facilitate category learning in children.",>Catherine A.

2011,Multisensory Statistical Learning: Can Cross-Modal Associations Be Acquired?,"Statistical learning, the process by which people learn patterns of information from their environment that they can apply to new situations, is central to the development of many higher order cognitive skills. Despite a growing research literature, little is still known about how statistical learning operates across perceptual categories. To investigate this issue we assessed college students on their ability to learn a multisensory artificial grammar containing both auditory and visual elements and both within-categorical and cross-categorical associations. The results of Experiment 1 showed that participants were sensitive to grammatically correct test items and ungrammatical test items that contained within-categorical grammatical violations, but were not sensitive to items that contained cross-categorical violations across sensory modalities. Experiment 2 showed that participants were not sensitive to items that contained cross-categorical violations within the same sensory modality. Our findings suggest that multisensory integration across perceptual categories does not occur easily during statistical learning.",>Anne Walk>Christopher Conway,>Saint Louis University>Saint Louis University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0772/index.html
2011,"Individual Differences and Lexical Learning: Links to memory for faces, things, and words","The Lexical Quality Hypothesis (Perfetti & Hart, 2002) suggests that the difficulties exhibited by poor readers cascade from deficient (impoverished, fuzzy) representations of phonological, semantic, and orthographic dimensions in lexical memory. If so, readers, even as adults, should vary in their ability to acquire new lexical representations. In our study, we examine the role of cross-modal (visual to phonological) associations in lexical learning. By pairing an artificial lexicon with novel objects, we aim to see whether learning implicit associations between new words and visual features of novel objects can be predicted by participants' performance in a number of visual and language-related assessments.

Activity involved selecting relevant facts and strategies and connecting them by arrows. It is found that patterns of arrow drawing have significant correlates in student performance and cognitive states. (i) Forward chaining is significantly more predominant during problem solving than during initial exploration that is not goal-driven. (ii) Students scoring in the middle are more likely to enter convergent pairs of arrows compared to students who scored low or high (P<0.00005). These findings enable diagnosing student problem solving and imply constraints on selection of cognitive architectures for modeling student learning.

2011,Retrieving semantic information from faces and voices.,"Semantic information is more likely to be retrieved from recognized faces than from recognized voices. Earlier studies which investigated the recall of biographical information following person recognition used famous peoples voices and faces. The present study was designed with the aim of controlling more strictly the exposure frequency to both domains of stimuli (voices and faces). Participants had first to associate semantic information (i.e., occupation) with unknown faces or voices. As stimulus distinctiveness could improve semantic information retrieval, participants were presented with typical versus distinctive stimuli from either domain. When later cued by the targets faces or voices, participants provided significantly more semantic information from faces than from voices. Moreover, distinctive stimuli yield to a significantly better recall of occupations than typical stimuli. No significant interaction appeared between Domain of stimuli and Distinctiveness. These results and their implications for current Interactive Activation and Competition person recognition models are discussed.",>Catherine Barsics,>University of Liège,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0775/index.html
2011,Verbal descriptions hurt face recognition in children and adults,"The verbal overshadowing effect (VO), first demonstrated by Schooler and Engstler-Schooler (1990), indicates that providing a verbal description of a previously seen face may impair its recognition on a subsequent lineup identification task. This phenomenon, widely demonstrated in adults, was investigated in children only once (Memon & Rose, 2002): no VO effect was found with 8-9 years old participants. However, some procedural details were not controlled in this experiment and the absence of a control adult group did not allow determining whether the procedure used was able to induce a VO effect. Current experiments examine the VO effect in several groups of children (7-8, 10-11, 13-14 years old) and adults to determine the developmental trajectory of the phenomenon across the ages. In both experiments, verbalization interfered with identification performance in all childrens and adults groups.

2011,Trial-by-trial variance in visual working memory capacity estimates as a window into the architecture of working memory,"Nearly all models of visual working memory have focused on fitting average memory performance across many simple displays of colored squares. Unfortunately, fitting average performance can mask an underlying failure of the model to account for performance by particular observers in particular displays. We had N=475 observers perform exactly the same set of continuous color report trials (e.g.,Zhang&Luck;,2008), and found a significant amount of observer-to-observer consistency in which displays are hardest and easiest to remember items from. While existing models of visual working memory fail to explain this variance, we present an expanded model that accounts for perceptual grouping, the encoding of summary statistics, and attentional selection, and show that such a model considerably improves the fit to the data. We suggest that in order to understand the architecture and capacity of visual working memory, models must take into account differences in the information observers encode about each particular display.",>Timothy Brady,">Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0777/index.html

The present study adopts an activation-based account of the misinformation effect in order to support the hypothesis that true and suggested information can coexist in memory. After exposure to misinformation, participants were primed with semantic associates of either the true or suggested item. Misled participants who were primed for the true item performed better on a final memory test than misled participants primed for neutral information. The results indicate that true and suggested information coexist, and retrieval is influenced by how activated each concept is at test.

2011,The Impact of Musical Experience on Statistical Language Learning,"Musical experience has been found to improve language (Schön, et al., 2007) and literacy skills (Anvari, et al., 2002). Here, we consider whether musical experience contributes to an important component of language learning, namely segmentation of novel sound sequences. Participants with varying degrees of musical experience were exposed to two statistically-defined languages, one consisting of Morse-code sequences and one of pure-tone sequences. In addition, conflicting cues were introduced to determine which auditory features musicians use when learning a novel language. Results show that participants with a higher degree of musical experience were more likely to learn Morse- and tone-based words, and those that learned did so primarily via temporal information. Effective temporal processing is likely to be useful in natural language learning (e.g., acquisition of voice-onset time and vowel length discriminations). We conclude that the mechanisms that underlie successful musical processing may also play a key role in language learning.",>Anthony Shook>Viorica Marian>James Bartolotti>Scott Schroeder>Sarah Chabal,>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University>Northwestern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0779/index.html
2011,An electroencephalographic examination of the origin of cognitive decline in aging adults during the colour word Stroop task,"It is consistently found that aging adults are limited in their ability to ignore distracting information while performing a cognitive task. To delineate the origin of this cognitive decline electroencephalography (EEG) was used to examine the brain activity of young adults (aged 20-30) and older adults (aged 45-65) as they performed a Stroop task. This task was designed to isolate stimulus and response level processing. Young adults and older adults showed similar behavioural results however, the underlying brain activity was significantly different in older adults. Specifically the P3a component was significantly larger and delayed in older adults indicating additional processing was required for reorienting attention. Additionally the N450 was enhanced over the parietal region in older adults. These results indicate that with age additional processing is required however there is not a general compensatory process but different compensatory mechanisms to serve specific stimulus or response related functions.",>Clare Killikelly>Denes Szucs,>University of Cambridge>University of Cambridge,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0780/index.html
2011,"Theory of Mind brain regions are sensitive to the content, not the structural complexity, of belief attributions","A distinct group of brain regions, the Theory of Mind (ToM) network, is implicated in representing other peoples mental states, yet we currently know little about which aspects of mental state attribution are represented or processed in these regions. Using fMRI, we investigated whether ToM regions, compared to language-processing regions, are sensitive to two dimensions along which mental state attributions vary: (1) structural complexity and (2) social content of the attributed thought. In short vignettes describing a character's belief, the belief structure was either first-order or higher-order, and the content was mundane or socially-relevant. All ToM regions showed sensitivity to distinctions in content; no ToM region showed sensitivity to structural manipulation. By contrast, language regions were sensitive to both manipulations. We conclude that while increased structural complexity of belief attributions modulates language processing, this type of complexity is not part of the representational space of the ToM-network.",>Jorie Koster-Hale>Rebecca Saxe,>Massachusetts Institute of Technology>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0781/index.html

This paper investigates the proposal that individual differences in belief will reflect cognitive processing styles, with high functioning autism being an extreme style that will predispose towards nonbelief (atheism and agnosticism). This view was supported by content analysis of discussion forums about religion on an autism website (covering 192 unique posters), and by a survey that included 61 persons with HFA. Persons with autistic spectrum disorder were much more likely than those in our neurotypical comparison group to identify as atheist or agnostic, and, if religious, were more likely to construct their own religious belief system. Nonbelief was also higher in those who were attracted to systemizing activities, as measured by the Systemizing Quotient.",>Catherine Caldwell-Harris>Caitlin Fox Murphy>Tessa Velazquez>Patrick McNamara,>Boston University>Boston University>Boston University>Boston University School of Medicine,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0782/index.html

2011,A Dynamical Systems Reformulation of the Normalized Recurrence Algorithm,"The Normalized Recurrence Algorithm is a kind of localist attractor network describing the temporal dynamics in continuous and recurrent information integration emerging in experimental psychology data (The Continuity of Mind, Michael Spivey, 2007). Despite the fact that this algorithm successfully models time series data, it is somewhat unsatisfactory to deal with an algorithm within a dynamical systems context and furthermore it is difficult to prove conjectures, so we suggest this description: E(t+1)=E(t)+E(t)xC*E(t), where t is time, E is all the different activity vectors pooled together and C is a connectivity matrix (x and * is the matrix and hadamard product respectively). The normalization is performed post hoc only, and with this reformulation we can now prove the set size/convergence linearity hypothesis (p220), and reject the indirect crosstalk hypothesis (p103), and more importantly open up this model to comparisons within the field of dynamical systems where it truly belongs.",>Bo Pedersen,>Rosetta Stone Labs,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0784/index.html
2011,The effect of confidence hysteresis on number perception and decision making,"Perceptual decision making requires acquiring perceptual evidence and judging the reliability of such evidence. Thus, the confidence one has in the signal at hand affects perceptual decisions. Here we demonstrate that this form of confidence also dynamically depends on the perceivers previous task performance  a form of confidence hysteresis. Both children and adults performed a numerical discrimination task in which the order of trials was either from the hardest trials (e.g., 10 vs. 9 dots) to the easiest (e.g., 10 vs. 5 dots), or vice-versa. The order of trials had a pronounced effect on later discriminations, and especially for children in the hard-to-easy condition, whose performance at easy ratios was so poor that it resembled the discrimination ability of 9-month-old infants. These results are consistent with a variety of diffusion models with parameters for the rate of information (e.g., drift rate) accrual and time-limited criterion for generating an answer.",>Darko Odic>Howard Hock>Justin Halberda,>Johns Hopkins University>Florida Atlantic University>Johns Hopkins University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0785/index.html

2011,Representation Based on Goal-Achievement: Explaining Motor Intentionality,"Whether motor intentionality needs representation is debated, and what sense of representation it is needs clarification. Dreyfus (2000, 2002) interprets Merleau-Pontys notion of motor intentionality as different significantly from that in traditional cognitive science, and argues for intelligence without representation. The involving intelligence is demonstrated in Freemans (1991) attractor theory. By contrast, Clark (1997, 2002, 2003), Christensen & Hooker (2000, 2002), Grush (2004), Keijzer (2001), and Pezzulo (2008) argue for the need of representation for the motor intentionality. In the debate, a question needs answer: is there a naturalistic account of the motor intentionality? To answer this question, the present project raises a naturalistic account of motor intentionality, on grounds of goal-setting and goal-achievement with recourse to the bodily movement. The present project argues that the motor representation can even be demonstrated in an architecture based on the dynamic field theory, a version of the attractor theory.",>Hsi-wen Daniel Liu,>Providence University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0789/index.html
2011,Simultaneous Prediction and Reaction in Sequence Learning,"Prediction, in its simplest meaning, is a claim that a certain event will happen in the future. Reaction, in contrast, is a response from some eliciting event. We look at the concepts through an online reaction-time game. Thirty-three participants rapidly clicked on circles appearing on different corners of the computer screen according to statistical regularities. Although a reactive strategy was dominant, a mixed predictive/reactive mode began to emerge towards the tasks conclusion. We hypothesize that through extensive exposure to sequences, participants were quicker to interchange between the two stable modes, potentially yielding an optimal predictive/reactive mode. Additionally, a predictive strategy aided in recall test. Results suggest that processes underlying basic sensorimotor sequencing are both predictive and reactive, interleaving by task context and training. Our findings provide insight into the nature of prediction and reaction as mental processes and also allow us to explore how strategy manifests in low-level cognitive tasks.",>Ronni Jupson>Rick Dale,>The University of Memphis>The University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0790/index.html

Face-threatening statements such as `some people hated your speech' encourage the broad interpretation that everyone hated the speech. Because previous research showed that broad interpretations are normally faster and easier, politeness should be easy to process, since it would encourage what is normally the easier interpretation of the statement. Using response time measures and a cognitive load manipulation, this research shows that just the opposite is true: Face threatening contexts encourage the broad interpretation of `some' while making it longer and more difficult to reach. This result raises difficulties for current cognitive theories of pragmatic inferences.",>Jean-François Bonnefon>Wim De Neys>Aidan Feeney,">CNRS

Using the successor representation (SR, Dayan, 1993, Neural Computation) to capture statistical regularities in temporally extended fixation sequences we were able to assess strategic shifts in eye-movement patterns and predict scores on Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) test. Thirty-five participants completed two subsets of APM items on two separate days. Principal-component analysis of the SRs revealed individual differences in scanning patterns. The strongest principal component quantified the tendency to systematically scan the Raven matrix by rows; another component quantified the tendency to toggle to and from the response area. Leave-one-out cross validation demonstrated that these two components predicted 41% of the variance in Raven scores. These findings indicate that high-scoring individuals not only use a constructive matching strategy, but that they tend to process the problem systematically by rows, while low-scoring individuals tend to be less systematic and toggle more frequently.",>Alexander Petrov>Taylor Hayes>Per Sederberg,>Ohio State University>Ohio State University>Ohio State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0792/index.html

2011,Distracting the Hands: The effect of visuospatial interference upon iconic gesture production and speech,"Iconic gestures are hand movements that represent shapes, objects and functions of a referent. When gesture is restricted, imagery decreases and speech dysfluencies (which are most pronounced when communicating spatial information) increase. Since gesture restriction adversely affects both imagery and the communication of spatial information, many theorists have argued that visuospatial working memory (VSWM) underlies iconic gesture production. Although studies have suggested that there is a strong relationship between iconic gesture production and VSWM, a study has yet to be conducted which tests the effects of visuospatial manipulation upon subsequent iconic gesture production. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between VSWM and iconic gesture production by manipulating the degree of visuospatial distraction without imposing restriction upon the hands. Preliminary findings suggest that the presence of a visuospatial distractor affects narrative production and that more distracting visual stimuli are associated with lower iconic gesture rates.",>Lisa Smithson>Elena Nicoladis,>University of Alberta>University of Alberta,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0794/index.html

Here we assess the ability of existing models to account for the time course of generalization shifts that occur when individuals learn to distinguish sounds. A set of simulations demonstrates that commonly used single-layer networks do not predict transitory shifts in generalization over the course of training, but that such dynamics can be accounted for when the output functions of these networks are modified to mimic the properties of cortical tuning curves. The simulations further suggest that prudent selection of training criteria can allow for more precise predictions of learning-related shifts in generalization gradients in behavioral experiments.",>Matthew Wisniewski>Lauren Guillette>Milen Radell>Christopher Sturdy>Eduardo Mercado,">University at Buffalo, SUNY>University of Alberta>University at Buffalo, SUNY>University of Alberta>University at Buffalo, SUNY",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0795/index.html
2011,Bilinguals Have Different Hemispheric Lateralization in Visual Word Processing from Monolinguals,"Previous studies showed reduced hemispheric asymmetry (HA) in visual tasks like face perception in bilinguals compared with monolinguals, suggesting experience in reading one or two languages could be a modulating factor. We examined whether HA differences in visual tasks can also be observed in bilinguals with different language backgrounds. We compared the behavior of three groups in a tachistoscopic English word sequential matching task: English monolinguals (alphabetic monolinguals, A-Ms), bilinguals with an alphabetic-L1 and English-L2 (alphabetic-alphabetic bilinguals, AA-Bs), and bilinguals with Chinese-L1 and English-L2 (logographic-alphabetic bilinguals, LA-Bs). The results showed AA-Bs had a stronger left hemispheric lateralization than A-Ms and LA-Bs, suggesting different language learning experiences can influence visual words processing. Our computational model could explain this effect, based on a perceptual HA theory; the modeling data suggested this difference may be due to the differences in both participants vocabulary size and word-to-sound mapping between alphabetic and logographic languages.",>Sze-Man Lam>Janet Hui-wen Hsiao,">Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong>Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0796/index.html
2011,In search of the elusive Initial model,"A key assumption of Mental Model theory (Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 2002) is that additional models increase working memory load.

In three studies, we presented adult Ps with conditional inferences, and burdened processing by restricting the time allotted (5 s. or 7 s) and by varying the degree of arbitrariness of the conditionals. With familiar conditionals, a small but significant (6.25%, p<.02) number of participants showed patterns consistent with IM in the 5 s. condition. With arbitrary conditionals, this showed greater use of IM in both time conditions (20%, p<.001). Finally, arbitrary conditionals with explicit negations in both terms, showed a high number of IM patterns (26%, p<.001), which increased with time. These studies provide clear evidence that reasoners use IM reasoning, mostly as a function of arbitrariness of premises.",>Hugues Lortie Forgues>Marie-Laurence Brunet>Henry Markovits,>Universite du Quebec A Montreal>Universite du Quebec A Montreal>Universite du Quebec A Montreal,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0797/index.html
2011,Inductive selectivity and integration of information from multiple sources,"Inductive selectivity is well-documented: when people make inductive inferences from categorical premises, they reason differently about intrinsic versus contextual properties. However, the mechanism yielding this pattern remains unknown. We examined how people integrate knowledge about given premise categories with their knowledge about properties when they generate inductive inferences. By varying property and measuring participants' beliefs about premise categories, we found that the integration process is markedly different for different kinds of properties. Specifically, we find that when the property is taxonomically biasing, the tendency to generate taxonomic inferences is largely independent of the salience of knowledge about premise categories, and is driven by the property alone. In contrast, when the property is contextually biasing, the tendency to generate contextual inferences depends on both the property and the salience of knowledge about premise categories. Thus, selectivity involves differences in how we integrate information as well as what inferences we generate.",>Nadya Vasilyeva>John Coley,>Northeastern University>Northeastern University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0798/index.html
2011,Accidental Proximal Events of Teleological Scenarios Increase Counterfactual Reasoning,"Participants were asked to rate the sufficiency and the necessity of the distal and the proximal causes of two scenarios which involve double prevention, to test the idea of causal explanatory pluralism (Lombrozo, 2010) which emphasizes the mode of explanation, and the judgment dissociation theory (Mandel, 2003) which emphasizes the goal of causal reasoning. The events in one scenario were related with the goal, whereas the events in the other scenario were merely mechanical. In addition, the proximal causes action was described either intentional or accidental. If causal pluralism is more relevant, the effects of intentionality of the proximal actors action would be different between the two scenarios and the same between sufficiency and necessity judgments. If JDT is more relevant, the effects of intentionality would be different between the two judgments. Results of the experiments were more in accordance with the JDT theory.",>Jae Hyuk Choi>Kyung Soo Do,">Sungkyunkwan University,

In the former phase, many possibilities for the hypotheses are considered; and in the latter phase a focal rule is decided upon. In the current study, we investigated the search phase using eye movement data. We detected two types of search strategy: one strategy was a spread-attention search in which participants spread their attention over a broad area in rule space; and the other was a focused-attention search in which participants concentrate their attention on a narrow area in rule space. Results of our experiment showed that the focused-attention search strategy was more effective for rule discovery than the spread-attention search strategy.",>Miki Matsumuro>Kazuhisa Miwa,">Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University>Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0801/index.html

Here we explore the extent to which lack of exposure to symbols affects childrens learning from pictures. Infants were recruited from a rural village in Tanzania and had no experience with symbols. After a picture book interaction during which a novel depicted object was labeled, we assessed infants learning and transfer of the label from pictures to their referents. In a second study, we assessed infants learning and generalization of labels using real objects. There was a significant difference in learning and generalization from pictures, but not objects, when compared with infants in western culture. Findings provide evidence for the role of early experience with symbols in childrens ability to use pictures as a source of information.",>Caren Walker>Lisa Walker>Patricia Ganea,">University of California, Berkeley>Harvard Graduate School of Education>Boston University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0802/index.html

Both involved combinatorics, using outcome listing and combinatorics formulas as examples of grounded and formal representations, respectively. Experiment 1 compared performance on near and far transfer problems following instructions involving listing or formulas. Instruction in formulas led to more near transfer, while far transfer performance did not differ by condition. Experiment 2 compared performance following four types of instruction: listing only, formulas only, listing fading (listing followed by formulas), and listing introduction (formulas followed by listing). The listing fading condition led to performance on par with the formulas only condition, and for near transfer problems, significantly higher than the listing introduction and pure listing conditions. The results support the inclusion of grounded representations in combinatorics instruction, and suggest that such representations should precede rather than follow formal representations in the instructional sequence.",>David Braithwaite>Robert Goldstone,>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0803/index.html
2011,A Linguistic Remark on SNARC: Language and Perceptual Processes in Spatial-Numerical Association,"The spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect provides evidence for perceptual simulation of symbols. However, a perceptual simulation account leaves little room for non-embodied accounts, even though recent studies have demonstrated that statistical linguistic data can explain the findings from various embodied cognition studies. The current study explored whether linguistic factors could also explain the SNARC effect. In a response time experiment participants were asked to make parity judgments of number words. Frequencies of those number words explained the results just as well as a perceptual simulation explanation. Moreover, collocation frequencies (the previous word and the following word) also explained response times, further demonstrating that linguistic factors might play an important role in number processing. The results of this experiment demonstrate that language encodes information that could also be attributed to perceptual simulations. Consequently, language users might also rely on these linguistic cues during number processing.",>Sterling Hutchinson>Sophia Johnson>Max Louwerse,>University of Memphis>University of Memphis>University of Memphis,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0804/index.html

This entails that some codings are better for a given content than others and that coding preferences could be part of UG (under a modern view: 'analytic biases that prefer certain language types over others'). Since verbs tend to code events and pronouncing a verb is also an event we call aspectual iconicity the identity of continuity values in both: English 'to stop' involves stop consonants and therefore codes termination iconically, German 'aufhören' does not. We used an artificial language together with purported German translations in order to test the hypothesis that aspectual iconicity is part of UG and observed a significant effect: Presented with a German sentence describing a (dis-)continuous event participants preferred a purported translation (to be read aloud) when articulation event and described event matched in continuity.",>Daniel Klenovsak>Dietmar Zaefferer,>LMU Munich>LMU Munich,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0805/index.html
2011,In Defense of Spatial Models of Lexical Semantics,"Semantic space models of lexical semantics learn vector representations for words by observing statistical redundancies in a text corpus. A words meaning is represented as a point in a high-dimensional semantic space. However, these spatial models have difficulty simulating human free association data due to the constraints placed upon them by metric axioms which appear to be violated in association norms. Here, we build on work by Griffiths, Steyvers, and Tenenbaum (2007) and test the ability of spatial semantic models to simulate association data when they are fused with a Luce choice rule to simulate the process of selecting a response in free association. The results provide an existence proof that spatial models can produce the patterns of data in free association previously thought to be problematic.",>Michael Jones>Thomas Gruenenfelder>Gabriel Recchia,>Indiana University>Indiana University>Indiana University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0806/index.html
2011,Do Culture Related Factors Influence Students' Critical Thinking Use?,"This study examined whether culture related factors influence university students critical thinking use. The participants were 363 students from Kyoto and Okinawa in Japan, and Auckland in New Zealand. They completed a questionnaire assessing critical thinking use, study self-efficacy, adherence to authority, regulatory mode (assessment/locomotion), and self-construal (independence/ interdependence). Critical thinking was found to correlate with self-efficacy, locomotion, and independence. The Auckland group scored higher than both Japanese groups in these factors. In contrast, the Okinawa group scored higher than the other two groups in adherence to authority and interdependence. Compared to either or both Japanese groups, the Auckland students also scored higher in the following critical thinking measures: objectivity in writing, logical thinking, and reliance on evidence. A hypothesis is proposed that self-construal is linked to regulatory mode and self-efficacy, and these in turn are linked to critical thinking use. The result of structural equation modeling supports this hypothesis.",>Emmanuel Manalo>Takashi Kusumi>Masuo Koyasu>Yasushi Michita>Yuko Tanaka,>Waseda University>Kyoto University>Kyoto University>University of the Ryukyus>Stevens Institute of Technology,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0807/index.html
2011,Having an Interdependent Self-Construal Leads to Greater Weighting of Data In Causal Judgment,"People's causal judgments show systematic biases, including over-weighting of confirming information, and favoring prior beliefs over data. We investigated the effects of self-construal on data-weighting in causal judgments. We primed participants with interdependent or independent self-construals (interdependent people define themselves through relationships; independent through individual traits). On 56 trials, each containing complete frequency information (i.e., frequency of presence/absence of the cause and presence/absence of the effect), participants judged the ability of a cause to produce an effect. We observed a main effect of prime: Interdependent participants' judgments covaried more with frequency information, suggesting they make greater use of data. Furthermore, on non-contingent trials, interdependents weighted all frequency data equally (independents did not). However, being interdependent did not perfectly ameliorate biases in the weighting of data: on contingent trials, both groups weighted the data unequally, favoring confirming, cause-present information. Thus, independents only sometimes demonstrated extra sensitivity to background information.",>Kelly M. Goedert>Lisa R. Grimm>Arthur B. Markman>Barbara A.

Participants were asked to observe an object, either of an animate thing (turtle) or an inanimate thing (robot), which was veiled so that they had to judge only by its motions, not appearance, what it was. We compared ERPs between the condition they felt it as animate and the condition they felt it as inanimate. We found that ERPs in left infero-frontal region was significantly different between the two conditions. Next, we changed the similarity of robot motion with turtle motion and compared ERPs. We found that ERPs in right occupito-temporal region changed with robot motions. These results suggest that the attribution of animacy and the processing of animate motion are related to the activation in left infero-frontal and right occupito-temporal region, respectively. This implies that animacy perception consists of two neural mechanisms.",>Haruaki Fukuda>Kazuhiro Ueda,">The University of Tokyo

2011,Expanding the Space of Cognition via Multi-scale Entrainment: A Medium for Education and Enculturation,"Data indicate that mirroring and anticipation constitute design principles of the brain. Mirroring resides in the sensory properties of neural systems previously believed to be purely motor (i.e., mirror systems), while anticipation resides in the fact these mirroring centers are involved in cerebellar-cortical circuits that are able to embody command-feedback regularities and, as a result, simulate action-effects faster than the speed of sensory feedback. Such anticipatory mirroring circuits are at work at the scale of action, perception, and cognition and constitute a medium by which interacting humans anticipatorily couple at multiple scales simultaneously as the movements, goals, and thoughts of another hijack ones own mirroring/planning systems. The present poster presents results of experiments that reveal the role that multi-scale anticipatory coupling (i.e., multi-scale entrainment) plays in decreasing stereotypes, increasing projection (i.e., attributing ones own personality traits to another), and learning anecdotal versus abstract information.",>J.

Additionally, recent research indicates a southern preference in route planning, which may derive from a spatial heuristic that links cardinal north with higher elevations (the north-is-up heuristic; Brunye et al., 2010). In two experiments we used an adapted Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure the possibility that participants automatically associate high and low elevation with attribute representations of north and south. Our results provide unique evidence for an implicit association between north/south and high/low elevation (respectively), demonstrating a heuristic that biases decision-making during navigation. Given the powerful influence of heuristics during spatial decision-making, these results carry implications for successfully predicting behavior in many applied contexts, including computational modeling of human behavior and developing algorithms for robotic navigation.",>Stephanie A.

This study examined differences in mental rotation strategies between good and poor imagers, defined by accuracy on the Shepard and Metzler (1971) mental rotation task. In two experiments, participants performed the mental rotation task with either complete or fragmented figures (figures with some missing cubes). Poor imagers performed similarly on fragmented and complete figures. Good imagers were more accurate and faster in general, but had longer reaction times on fragmented figures than on complete figures. These results suggest that good imagers use holistic mental rotation strategies, while poor imagers use piecemeal strategies.",>Peter Khooshabeh>Mary Hegarty>Thomas F.

2011,Decay of Information in Spatial Mental Images,"Why are mental images so fragile? Results using a new method for measuring mental image accuracy (Lyon, Gunzelmann & Gluck, Cognitive Psychology, 57, 2008) suggest that spatial interference  similar to lateral interference in vision  is an important factor, but not the only factor. We ask people to visualize a path through a 7x7 grid, indicating when the path revisits a location. Each path is described by spoken, segment-by-segment instructions (Right 1; Up 1; etc.). We define lag as the number of path segments intervening between visits to a path location. Longer lags produce lower accuracy. This could be explained by either decay or associative interference (from additional path segments). Results indicate that, when lag is held constant, there is no effect of number of path segments, whereas when number of segments is held constant, the lag effect is undiminished. This suggests that decay is the more likely explanation.",>Don Lyon,>L3 Communications at AFRL,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0813/index.html
2011,Is location memory biased towards a spatial or a functional prototype?,"The category adjustment (CA) model predicts that memory for items in a spatial category is biased towards the centre of the category (i.e. the category prototype) and away from the category boundaries (Huttenlocher, Hedges, & Duncan, 1991). These predictions are supported by studies that assess memory for dot locations within a circle. The current study tests whether memory for places in a large scale environment is similarly biased. Forty-three residents of Southampton (a UK city) were asked to locate 22 places in Southampton on a map. No significant bias was found towards the geographical centre. A second analysis, which tested whether remembered locations where biased towards the commercial centre, was significant. However, the results were not as predicted: places were remembered further away from, rather than closer to, the commercial centre. These findings suggest that the CA model needs to be refined to account for location memory in large-scale places.",>Paula Engelbrecht,>Ordnance Survey,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0814/index.html
2011,Orientation Preferences for Photographed Objects: Effects of Handedness and Object Type,"Previous research suggests that individuals show orientation preferences when perceiving or judging pictures of objects. Such preferences are typically attributed to cerebral lateralization effects. However, a laterality account cannot explain differences in orientation preferences for different types of objects. In the present study of aesthetic preference, 60 right-handed and 30 left-handed English-speaking participants were asked to photograph six different objects-iron, car, rhinoceros, airplane, teapot, and statue bust-in what they thought was the most aesthetically pleasing orientation. The objects were selected to differ in their implied motion, graspability, and animacy. Across handedness groups, an overall rightward facing preference was found for objects with implied motion and for animate objects; only one item (teapot) showed a differential effect of handedness (X2 = 5.383, p = .020). Planned analyses will investigate more carefully the degree of object orientation in relation to handedness and stimulus type (implied motion vs. graspable vs. animate).",>Rebecca Rhodes>Jyotsna Vaid>Eleazar Montes,>University of Michigan>Texas A&M; University>Texas A&M; University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0815/index.html

Primes differed in 1) syntactic frame, 2) distribution of manner and path elements within frames, and 3) degree of conceptual overlap with target events. Results demonstrate that the conceptual level of representation matters during production: structural priming decreased as degree of conceptual overlap between primes and targets decreased, and became nonexistent when there was no overlap.

This paper reports on longitudinal findings of this training study. After eight months, training differences did not exist for spatial skills, physics grades, or physics self-efficacy. Large gender differences, favoring males, existed for some spatial skills, physics self-efficacy, and physics grades. Correlational analyses found that mental rotation performance, not spatial working memory, predicted physics self-efficacy and some physics learning outcomes. These results suggest that sustained exposure to spatially enriching activities over several semesters or years may be necessary to address concerning gender gaps in spatial skills among those most likely to pursue advanced educational and occupational positions in physics.",>David I.

Consistent with previous research on spatial updating, performance was better when the frame of reference in the final display aligned with the main display axes (up/down, left/right) than when it aligned with the diagonal axes. However, we also found that spatial updating was more efficient when the sequence of presentation of objects was consistent with the final frame of reference from which objects were integrated. Results suggested that spatial updating depended on the sequence of spatial operations required to integrate new spatial information into existing ones.

2011,Cognitive processes underlying spatial belief revision,"New information sometimes contradicts what is believed about certain states of the world. To integrate contradicting information, reasoners have to revise existing beliefs. In the course of belief revision they need to decide which beliefs to retain and which ones to retract in order to regain consistency within current belief states. What guides belief revision has been studied in the non-spatial domain. Based upon previous work on spatial reasoning, we develop hypotheses about the cognitive processes of belief revision in spatial reasoning. Spatial beliefs are considered to be based on spatial mental models that are subject to variation during revision. We provide empirical evidence that models are varied according to information provided by inconsistent statements rather than processes vital for construction of initial models. Furthermore we show that revising spatial models follows dissociable principles from constructing initial spatial models.",>Leandra Bucher>Antje Krumnack>Jelica Nejasmic>Markus Knauff,>Justus-Liebig University Giessen>Justus-Liebig University Giessen>Justus-Liebig University Giessen>Justus-Liebig University Giessen,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0819/index.html
2011,Is there any Need to Mention Induction?,"Induction is the process by which seen data becomes the basis for predicting unseen data. There has long been a desire to explain the procedure in a context-free way. But Hume's circularity problem and the no-free-lunch theorems seem to suggest the impossibility of any context-free mechanism. Machine Learning takes the position no such mechanism exists. But an alternative comes from Epistemology. Popper's falsificationist theory holds there is a general mechanism, but that it does not perform induction. Inductive effects arise implicitly, through pursuit of a non-inductive goal. Less plausibly, the mechanism is taken to be uninformed exploration of hypotheses. But as the paper shows, Popper's solution can be reworked using information theory. Increasing the informational efficiency with which representations predict seen data can be shown to produce inductive effects. With representation optimization taking the place of hypothesis-search in the argument, it becomes possible to explain induction in a context-free way.",>Chris Thornton,>University of Sussex,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0820/index.html

We measured the impact of the split-attention effect on geometry problem solving by analyzing log-file data generated by students who used two versions of Carnegie Learning's intelligent tutoring system for geometry. The original version split students' attention across a table and diagram, while the revised version integrated the same information into a single interactive diagram. Although the number of hints and errors remained comparable (Cohen's d = -.05), students using the revised version (M = 9.30 min., SD = 8.23) spent significantly less time solving each problem than those using the original version (M = 11.77 min., SD = 14.85), F(1, 9361) = 92.64, p < .001, d = .20.

We hypothesized that strong top down predictions would allow for visual experience of only task relevant information. In a change detection task we manipulated the appearance of visual stimuli in the critical part of the experiment by removing up to 70% of several items. Our results demonstrate that people are completely unaware of visual detail, even when their attention is focused directly on test items. In a control experiment we showed that the inability to discriminate was not the cause of the unawareness.

2011,Category Learning From Alignable Examples: An Application to Structural Geology,"Geological forces shape the earths crust. Normal faults, for example, form when extensional forces pull blocks of rock apart along a plane, whereas reverse faults are formed by compressional forces. Geologists classify faults to retrace the forces that have acted on an area; however, normal and reverse faults often look similar. In this study we investigated whether viewing superficially similar (highly alignable) images of a normal and reverse fault would help people learn to distinguish the two categories. Highly alignable examples highlight alignable differencesin this case, spatial relations that distinguish normal from reverse faults (e.g., Gentner & Markman, 1994). Participants were presented with two fault imagesone normal, and one reverseembedded in a text about faults. The images were either high or low in alignability. Participants then completed a 22-item fault classification test.

This research includes an experiment with consumers to test what is more influential in idea generation for innovation: information, i.e. previous ideas about new uses of a product, or individual adoption category, i.e. innovator or early adopter. The result suggests that information is more influential in generating creative ideas for innovation, and early adopters, rather than innovators, make effective use of information in idea generation. An additional experiment for information retrieval suggests that innovators tend to avoid communication with non-innovators and focus more on the function and specifications of the product, potentially decreasing their performance in creative idea generation.",>Kazuhiro Ueda>Yuichi Washida,">The University of Tokyo / JST, CREST>Hakuhodo Inc.",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0826/index.html
2011,"Contingent Uncertainty, Strategic Uncertainty, and Coordination","Uncertainty about the coordination of common efforts (e.g. team projects, alliances) often coexists with uncertainty about other variables (e.g. weather, market fluctuations, political instability). In certain coordination games in which equilibria can potentially arise at any common effort level, ex ante equilibrium selection (particularly of high-effort, high-payoff equilibria) has been a persistent game theoretical challenge. This is largely due to the strategic uncertainty of each participant about the behavior of others, in the absence of communication and credible commitment. We performed experiments in which exogenous noise was added to the decisions of participants in a minimum-effort coordination game. Results indicate that this added contingent uncertainty can prevent perfect coordination at the lowest-payoff equilibrium, and thus make coordination at higher-payoff equilibria possible.",>Thomas Wisdom>Keigo Inukai>Kengo Kurosaka>Wataru Toyokawa>Yoichi Hizen>Tatsuya Kameda,">Department of Behavioral Science, Hokkaido University>Department of Economics, Hokkaido University>Department of Economics, Hokkaido University>Department of Behavioral Science, Hokkaido University>Department of Economics, Hokkaido University>Department of Behavioral Science, Hokkaido University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0827/index.html
2011,Iconicity in language processing: What signed languages reveal,"The visual/gestural modality of signed languages allows meaningful form/meaning mappings (iconicity) across numerous basic concepts. Some previous studies show that iconicity affects sign language processing. However work to date does not provide a clear answer about the mechanisms driving such an effect. In three experiments we found differential effects of iconicity in British Sign Language such that iconicity facilitates decisions on a meaning-related task (for phonological decisions about features motivated by iconicity), but slows responses when the task is not related to meaning (decisions about unmotivated features for the same signs). Further in a language production task, picture naming is facilitated for iconic signs. The findings suggest that iconic signs activate meaning representations more quickly than non-iconic signs regardless of the task (meaning-based or not) for both comprehension and production, whereby decisions related to that meaning are aided, but decisions not related to the meaning are hindered.",>Robin L.

2011,Evaluating the Divergent Auto-Encoder (DIVA) as a Machine Learning Algorithm,"The divergent auto-encoder (Kurtz, 2007) offers an alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for classification learning via back-propagation. The artificial neural network classifies based on its success reconstructing the input features (from shared, reduced dimensionality recodings) in terms of a generative model of each category. Successful simulations of rapid human learning of elemental, non-linearly separable category structures suggest potential in machine learning. In a series of simulation studies using benchmarks problems from the UCI database, the divergent autoencoder showed learning and generalization performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms with several major advantages: no evidence of overfitting, low sensitivity to parameter settings, and fast runtimes. Discussion focuses on three issues: (1) for what types of problems is the divergent autoencoder better or worse than leading algorithms; (2) comparison with MLP as the default architecture for classification learning with artificial neural networks; (3) comparison with other (Bayesian) generative methods for classification learning.",>Kenneth Kurtz>Xavier Oyarzabal,>Binghamton University (SUNY)>Binghamton University (SUNY),https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0829/index.html
2011,General Magnitude Representation and Mathematics: How Number and Area Acuity Relate to Math Ability,"Recent research points to a relation between non-verbal number estimation and knowledge of formally taught mathematical principles and operations, with more accurate estimation (i.e., number acuity) predicting better performance on standardized math tests (Halberda et al., 2008). Here we asked whether math ability relates to acuity for magnitude more generally, as might be predicted by a system of generalized magnitude representation (Walsh, 2003). Thirty-five undergraduates were given two standardized math tests (Woodcock-Johnson and KeyMath) and two non-verbal estimation tasks (which measured acuity for number and cumulative area). Analyses revealed both general associations between magnitude acuity and math ability (ranging from r = .368 to .488, ps < .05), as well as more specific associations between each type of acuity (number vs. area) and math (r = .383 - .511, ps < .05). These results suggest both common and more distinct connections between magnitude estimation and math.",>Justin Bonny>Stella Lourenco,>Emory University>Emory University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0830/index.html
2011,Going through the Motions: Skill Differences in the Representation of Arithmetic Operations,"How do adults represent arithmetic operations? One proposal is that addition is represented as rightward movement along a left-right mental number-line, whereas subtraction is represented as leftward movement (Hubbard et al., 2005). To test this proposal, 24 college students solved single-digit arithmetic problems displayed on a computer screen along with rightward- or leftward-moving dots. We hypothesized that that for addition, rightward motion would facilitate problem solution (as it is congruent with the mental representation of movement along a mental number-line) and that leftward movement would interfere with problem solution (as it is incongruent). For subtraction, the expectations of facilitation and interference were reversed. We found that the response times of students with lower levels of mathematical skill, though not with higher levels, showed the hypothesized operational momentum effect. This research has implications for the development of math pedagogy, especially for how operations are conceptually introduced.",>Marcie Penner-Wilger>David H.

2011,Context dependency and systematicity in connectionism,"I argue that connectionist models are well prepared to deal with the problem of context dependency. I understand the problem of context dependency in the case of language processing and in relation to the problem of systematicity as follows: if the meaning of a word in a sentence is context dependent, then the systematicity of our cognitive capacities could not be explained, since the same word in a new sentence (though being the same) would not have the same meaning as in the initial sentence, and then, concerning systematicity, our ability to produce or understand a new sentence would not depend on our ability to produce or understand the initial sentence. A correctly trained network should be able to distinguish them as different meanings precisely because the meaning is always differently determined in the network. I will discuss to which extent systematicity would be a problem for connectionism.",>Jordi Majà,>University of Edinburgh,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0832/index.html
2011,Creative Interference and States of Potentiality in Analogy Problem Solving,"Creative processes are widely believed to involve the generation of multiple, discrete, well-defined possibilities followed by exploration and selection. An alternative, consistent with parallel distributed processing models of associative memory, is that creativity involves the merging and interference of memory items resulting in a single cognitive structure that is ill-defined, and can thus be said to exist in a state of potentiality. We tested this hypothesis in an experiment in which participants were interrupted midway through solving an analogy problem and asked what they were thinking in terms of a solution. Naïve judges categorized their responses as AP if there was evidence of merging solution sources from memory resulting in an ill-defined idea, and SM if there was no evidence of this. Data from frequency counts and mean number of SM versus AP judgments supported the hypothesis that midway through creative processing an idea is in a potentiality state.",>Liane Gabora>Adam Saab,>University of British Columbia>University of British Columbia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0833/index.html
2011,Robust Language Acquisition  an Emergent Consequence of Language as a Complex Adaptive System,"Each of us as learners had different language experiences, yet we have converged on broadly the same language system. How so? Some views hold that there are constraints upon learners induction of language pre-programmed in some innate language acquisition device. Others hold that the constraints are in the dynamics of language itself  that language form, language meaning, and language usage come together to promote robust induction by means of statistical learning over limited samples. The research described here explores this question with regard English verbs, their grammatical form, semantics, and patterns of usage. Analyses of a 100-million-word corpus show how Zipfian scale-free distributions of usage ensure robust learning of linguistic constructions as categories: constructions are (1) Zipfian in their type-token distributions in usage, (2) selective in their verb form occupancy, and (3) coherent in their semantics. Parallel psycholinguistic experiments demonstrate the psychological reality of these constructions in language users.",>Nick Ellis>Matthew Brook O'Donnell,>University of Michigan>University of Michigan,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0834/index.html
2011,When does provision of instruction promote learning?,"Contradictory evidence has been reported on the effects of discovery learning approach and the role of instructional explanations. By manipulating the presence of instruction (verbal explanation) and transparency of problem structures, we investigated how effects of instructional explanations differed depending on the transparency of problem structure. We developed an auxiliary representational task that made certain aspects of the problem structure more transparent. Instruction proved irrelevant to those aspects of the problem made transparent by the representation but facilitated learning of those aspects that were left obscure. We suggest that the critical role of instruction is not specifying the steps in solving a problem, but rather making salient the features that are critical to students ability to infer the steps from examples.",>Hee Seung Lee>Abraham Anderson>Shawn Betts>John Anderson,>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University>Carnegie Mellon University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0835/index.html
2011,The mirage of morphological complexity,"I present a study on the morphological complexity of six European languages. A theory-free measure of the complexity of a language's inflectional morphology, is derived from Gell-Mann's concept of Effective Complexity. Using a parallel corpus, I show that disconsidering word order information results in the classical gradation of inflectional complexity: Languages in which words have more inflected variants seem to be more complex than languages with fewer variants. It also appears that the presence of the inflectional system increases the complexity of languages. However, when word order information is explicitly considered, the apparent gradation in complexity across languages vanishes. Furthermore, it becomes clear that the presence of inflections reduces the overall complexity of languages. In sum, inflection is used whenever its presence simplifies a language's description. Inflectional morphology is not a capricious feature, as some argue, but rather an effective tool for complexity reduction.",>Fermin Moscoso del Prado,>CNRS,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0836/index.html
2011,The Effects of Peer Tutoring and Teachable Agent on Interest and Task Performance,"This experiment was conducted to compare the effects of peer tutoring with an intelligent teachable agent (TA), the Korea university intelligent agent (KORI), on students'interest and task performance according to their level of self-efficacy. The results showed a significant interaction effect on interest between the peer tutoring/KORI and the level of self-efficacy. The high self-efficacious group had greater interest in peer tutoring than in KORI, whereas the low self-efficacious group had greater interest in KORI than in peer tutoring. Analysis of the task performance revealed that there was a main effect of peer tutoring/KORI and interaction effect on the task performance between peer tutoring/ KORI and the level of self-efficacy. The participants with high self-efficacy received high scores in both peer tutoring and KORI, whereas the participants with low self-efficacy gained higher scores in KORI than in peer tutoring.",>Yeonhee So>Youngok Kim,>Kyungnam University>Kyungnam University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0837/index.html
2011,Is Arithmetic Embodied? Differential Interference of Sequential Finger Tapping on Addition during a Dual Task Paradigm,"We propose that the unique ability of humans to have separate mental representations for each finger and to move them in different sequential orders were redeployed for arithmetic. We tested our hypothesis with a behavioral dual-task experiment, where subjects (N=46) solved addition problems (primary task) and performed a sentence comprehension task (control task), while concurrently tapping their fingers (secondary task). We examined two sequential finger tapping tasks: one that was more automatic and followed the anatomical finger order (simple) and one that relied heavily on sequence processing (complex). The results revealed that both simple and complex finger tapping differentially interfered with addition compared to sentence comprehension. These results provide support for a finger-based representation of numbers and shared use of sequence processing resources for finger movements and addition.",>Firat Soylu>Sharlene Newman,">Department of Instructional Systems Technology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN

The model is an SRN (Elman, 1990) trained on article-noun phrases input phoneme-by-phoneme. It learns to incrementally map its input to object concepts beginning with those sounds. After training, it exhibits behavior similar to French natives using gender to constrain lexical access: When the article preceding a noun is ambiguous in gender, all possible nouns are considered during lexical competition, but when a noun is preceded by a gender-marked article, only congruent nouns are considered as potential lexical candidates. The model is shown to generalize well to novel data including unseen article-noun combinations, leading us to conclude that it has in fact learned an abstract notion of gender and discovered the broader gender patterns in French article-noun sequences.",>Garance PARIS>Matthew CROCKER>Marshall MAYBERRY,">Department of Computational Linguistics,

Children between 5 and 11 years pressed a button each time they judged that a brief time interval had passed. In two conditions, children either picked their own time interval, their preferred pace, or they were given an imposed pace of 400 ms (2.5 Hz). The resulting trial series were subjected to detrended fluctuation analysis to estimate the complexity of the temporal coordination between child and task. Results show a developmental trend, from an overly random to more clearly fractal performance when the target time interval was predetermined by the experimenter, but not when the target time interval was chosen spontaneously.",>Lori Gresham>Sebastian Wallot>Heidi Kloos>Guy Van Orden,>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati>University of Cincinnati,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0840/index.html
2011,Impact of emotion on numerical estimation,"Research has demonstrated that both attention and emotion influence temporal perception. Even though behavioral findings support a common system for temporal and numerical estimations, no research has investigated the impact of emotion on numerical estimation or the role that attention plays in that process. Using a numerical bisection task, the current research investigated enumeration of emotional events (Study 1) as well as the influence of attentional distraction (Study 2). Overall, (1) the number of emotional faces is underestimated compared to the number of neutrally valenced faces, and (2) when attention is divided, the number of negatively valenced faces is underestimated. Emotional stimuli may capture attention more rapidly, and as such, increase enumeration accuracy.",>Katrina Rodzon>Joesph Baker>Kerry Jordan,>Utah State University>Utah State University>Utah State University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0841/index.html

However, in a prior study (Cranford & Moss, 2010), we found that participants derive solutions by insight in at least two different ways. In the present study, we attempted to extend upon prior studies by dividing insight solutions into two categories: immediate and delayed. The results show a large difference between the pattern of activation for immediate-insight solutions and delayed-insight solutions.

2011,Pitch Structure of Melodic Lines: An Interface between Physics and Perception,This work studies melodic lines of western art music tradition from frequency of occurrence of their constitutive elements. The model of analysis uses pairs of successive sounds as the minimal structural elements of a melody. Each pair of possible sounds in a musical instrument is associated to a quantity related to the difference of acoustic energies of the sound waves. This quantity expresses consonance properties that have been studied in experiments about the perception of combinations of sounds. We find statistical distributions of this quantity that show the existence of preferences for certain elements in a given melodic line. This preference can be interpreted as a consequence of the use of both formal musical theory rules and the creativity of the composer in order to create pleasant sensations in the listener.,>Jorge Eduardo Useche>Rafael Germán Hurtado,>Universidad Nacional de Colombia>Universidad Nacional de Colombia,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0843/index.html
2011,Its all about the game: Infants action strategies during imitation are influenced by their prior expectations,"Infants imitation is influenced by causal and intentional cues. Here we examine whether imitation is influenced by prior social expectations. Infants (mean age = 27 months) first played one of three games either: 1) copying the experimenters gestures, 2) establishing and working toward a shared goal or 3) a non-interactive control. They then participated in a separate imitation task involved both causally necessary and unnecessary actions and a goal. Infants who began by copying the experimenter were more likely to imitate causally unnecessary actions, infants who played a game with a shared goal were more likely to only perform causally necessary actions. Infants in the non-interactive control had no preferred response, and were least likely to achieve outcome as demonstrated. These results implicate the broader social context as an important factor guiding the actions infants choose to imitate, and have implications for the role of imitation in early learning.",>Yue Yu>Tamar Kushnir,">Department of Human Development, Cornell University>Department of Human Development, Cornell University",https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0844/index.html
2011,The integration of frequency and phonetic variation in the perception of accented speech,"How listeners understand spoken words despite massive variation in the speech signal is a central issue for linguistic theory. A recent focus on lexical frequency and specificity has proved fruitful in accounting for this phenomenon. Speech perception, though, is a multi-faceted process and likely incorporates a number of mechanisms to map a variable signal to meaning. We examine a well-established language use factor  lexical frequency  and how this factor is integrated with phonetic variability during the perception of accented speech. We show that an integrated perspective highlights a low-level perceptual mechanism that accounts for the perception of accented speech absent native contrasts, while shedding light on the use of interactive language factors in the perception of spoken words.",>Marie-Catherine de Marneffe>John Tomlinson>Marisa Tice>Meghan Sumner,>Stanford University>Cardiff University>Stanford University>Stanford University,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2011/papers/0845/index.html
2011,Towards Computational Guessing of Unknown Word Meanings: The Ontological Semantic Approach,"The paper describes a computational approach for guessing the meanings of previously unaccounted words in an implemented system for natural language processing. Interested in comparing the results to what is known about human guessing, it reviews a largely educational approach, partially based on cognitive psychology, to teaching humans, mostly children, to acquire new vocabulary from contextual clues, as well as the lexicographic efforts to account for neologisms. It then goes over the previous NLP efforts in processing new words and establishes the differencemostly, much richer semantic resourcesof the proposed approach. Finally, the results of a computer experiment that guesses the meaning of a non-existent word, placed as the direct object of 100 randomly selected verbs, from the known meanings of these verbs, with methods of the ontological semantics technology, are presented and discussed. While the results are promising percentage-wise, ways to improve them within the approach are briefly outlined.",>Julia M. Taylor>Victor Raskin>Christian F.

The present study compares cognitive function of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) before and after multidisciplinary pain therapy (MDTP). 32 patients with cLBP and 25 healthy controls were assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). The Trail Making Test (TMT), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and multiple choice vocabulary test (MWT-B) were used to evaluate the intelligence quotient (IQ) in parallel. Before MDTP, patients needed significantly longer time in TMTA and TMT-B, in comparison to HC. Three weeks and 6 months after MDTP, the reaction time in TMT-A and MWT-B results of patients was significantly improved after MDTP. These findings provide new insights into impairment in information processing and executive function in people with cLBP and dysfunction of working memory.

It analyzes Recommendation Systems (RS) on the Web in order to understand how they are changing user-experiences and, consequently, affecting the fundamental structures of journalism. Todays networks are decentralized with few barriers to entry. They provide new ways of consuming journalistic production, and have altered the system established by broadcasting, transforming the relationship between audience and informational preferences. New possibilities are emerging that will define how the information emitter provides social relevance to its audience. Relevance is the basis of RS and for the algorithms that, unseen by their audience, operate invisibly and transparently. New information ecosystem is eliminating the dividing line between information emitter and receptor of journalistic information.
